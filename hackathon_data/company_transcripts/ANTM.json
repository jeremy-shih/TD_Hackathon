I would now like to turn the conference over to the company\u2019s management.","Doug Simpson","Good morning and welcome to Anthem\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. This is Doug Simpson and with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Government Business Division; Brian Griffin, President of our Commercial Specialty Business Division; and Tom Zielinski, our General Counsel.","Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our first few months at Anthem and her vision for the company. John will then discuss our financial results for 2017 and the fourth quarter, our business unit performance and our key financial metrics performance. Finally, Gail will go over our initial 2018 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advice listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Gail.","Gail Boudreaux","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review Anthem\u2019s fourth quarter and year end 2017 performance and our plans for continued growth in 2018 and beyond. This morning, we reported fourth quarter 2017 GAAP earnings per share of $4.67 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.29, which were ahead of our expectations driven by balanced performance across our businesses.","Operating revenues in 2017 grew by 5.8% to over $89 billion. Our medical loss ratio came in at a better than expected 86.4% for the year and operating cash flow exceeded $4.2 billion for the year growth of 28% over 2016. We are pleased with our improved business momentum in the quarter and our continued traction in the marketplace as evidenced by solid membership trends in key parts of our business, including our fully insured large and small group commercial markets and the completion of the HealthSun transaction, which added approximately 40,000 new consumers to our Medicare Advantage business. We finished 2017 slightly ahead of expectations serving the benefit needs of more than 40.2 million consumers, representing growth of 325,000 members during the year.","Also medical costs were well managed for the year and our full year medical loss ratio came in better than expected. Our continued focus on cost of care improvements drove improved medical expense trends, specifically in our Medicaid individual and local group insured businesses and resulted in a medical loss ratio of 88.6% in the fourth quarter. As a result of our solid fourth quarter 2017 results, we entered 2018 with operating momentum and are well positioned for sustainable long-term high-quality earnings growth. One of my key priorities since joining Anthem a little more than 2 months ago has been to perform a thorough review of the business and to quickly gain a deep understanding of how the company operates and the opportunities we have to improve our performance in 2018 and beyond.","I spent a lot of time in recent weeks visiting our local markets around the country and meeting with our associates as well as care providers, customers, brokers and other business partners. I have seen firsthand a strong business foundation built on a deep commitment to our communities and the people we serve and a culture that embodies our value of being accountable, caring, easy to do business with innovative and trustworthy. Building on our strong legacy, I believe we have a substantial opportunity to further raise our performance across the Anthem. I have challenged our organization has a relentless focus on day-to-day execution in order to deliver continuously greater impact on the affordability and quality of healthcare in America. Specifically, we need to advance our consumer focus innovation and data analytics capabilities to leverage our strong brand and local market position and drive greater value for our customers.","While we will continue to find my view, I have some initial thoughts to share on my priorities and vision for Anthem. In the near-term my primary focus is on optimizing execution across our business segment. Anthem has been building a strong operating platform, but there is still more that we can do to better serve our customers and improve our financial performance. In order to meet the increasing expectations and needs of our members we need to increase our focus on developing innovative solutions that emphasizes affordability and flexibility and increase speed to market and delivering these solutions. We will continue to focus on the drivers of medical costs and identify new ways to deploy cost of care solutions more quickly and effectively so that we can further improve the quality of care our members receive while also reducing the costs they incur. And we will work to better leverage Anthem\u2019s many best-in-class capabilities to drive further growth including our deep expertise in integrated care, our increased focus on provider relations, our medical cost value proposition, our growing consumer capabilities, our local market presence and our brand advantages through our Blue Commercial business in the Amerigroup name.","In 2018 we will also be making incremental investments in technology modernization efforts, consumer facing digital technologies and product development capabilities. Specifically, we are accelerating our efforts to migrate our membership onto our end state platform which will improve consistency in the consumer experience and make us more efficient. Additionally, we are investing in new digital and mobile capabilities to drive greater automation and enhance our consumer experience. This includes developing new external facing applications and portals that will make it easier for members, agents and care providers to conduct business with Anthem and also enhancing capabilities for more personalized and responsive customer\u2019s choice. We are also building an end to end modular process to allow control flexibility to efficiently configure product designs and make it simpler to integrate those products onto our data platforms. These investments are a few examples of our efforts to make the healthcare systems simpler to navigate, more effective and more affordable for our consumers.","Looking more specifically at the growth opportunities in our businesses, Anthem\u2019s government business which currently represents over 50% of consolidated operating revenue is positioned for sustainable growth across the Medicaid and Medicare platforms. Our Medicaid team is targeting a significant pipeline of opportunity as states increasingly recognize the role of that healthcare companies like Anthem can play as their partner, working with an ever tightening budget constraints to better manage the healthcare of the individuals they serve. We see $80 billion worth of incremental business opportunities between now and the end of 2022, much of which encompasses state specialized service population.","We are also focused on developing strategic partnerships with other health plans and providers including plans in the Blue network that combine our best-in-class Medicaid operating platform with their local market expertise. For example, we recently formed a partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota which goes into effect in the fall of 2018 and will serve approximately 375,000 members by the end of the year through its Medicaid and dual eligible program. In 2017 we also partnered with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana to form Healthy Blue which currently serves approximately 240,000 Medicaid members. Looking ahead, we see opportunities to continue to leverage our deep expertise in Medicaid to form new partnerships and alliances with our Blue colleague providers and other health plans to expand our presence and reach into new markets.","In Medicare, we continue to see substantial growth opportunities as approximately 11,000 baby-boomers aging to Medicare eligible population everyday. Historically, Anthem has lagged the Medicare Advantage penetration and we have been working to capture more of our fair share of this market. I believe we are now well-positioned to leverage our improved individual Medicare Advantage platform. Specifically, I am confident that we have the ability to leverage our strong brand, our more competitive product offerings and our focused marketing and sales investment to further capture share in this growing market. We are encouraged with our strong individual Medicare Advantage growth rate in 2017 and continuing through the 2018 open enrollment period where we have outpaced the growth rate as a market. We continue to expect organic growth rates in the low to mid double-digits over the next few years outpacing growth in our existing markets of 6% to 9%.","Our Medicare Advantage market share will also benefit from the completion of our acquisition of HealthSun and the pending acquisition of America\u2019s 1st Choice. Together, these companies will add approximately 170,000 new Medicare Advantage lives as well as deep provider relationships in the key Florida market. With the addition of these plans, our total Florida Medicare Advantage membership will be approximately 220,000. We are now focused on strengthening our capabilities in the employer group business and expect to see noticeable growth in this Medicare Advantage segment soon. Supporting all of this growth is our improved star rating now with over 70% of our membership residing in 4-star plans for the 2018 payment year. Additionally, Anthem will be only carrying with five 5-star plans following the close of America\u2019s 1st Choice acquisition.","In the commercial business, there is meaningful opportunity to leverage our local market knowledge and improve the historical membership trends of Anthem\u2019s fully insured medical business at appropriate margins by providing more consumer focused offerings and investing in digital capabilities. We have a solid foundation to build even deeper relationships with consumers and care providers. For example, Anthem operates 3 of the top 10 best performing commercial health plans as ranked by the NCQA. These are superior plans, which consistently deliver top scores in customer satisfaction, preventive care and outcomes in areas such as diabetes, asthma and heart disease. In addition, we plan to extend the breadth of our self-funded customer relationships by improving the penetration rates of specialty products.","The specialty team has made significant progress over the past few years improving the competitiveness of our dental and vision offerings. We ended 2017 with a commercial dental penetration rate of a little less than 20% and vision penetration rate of about 25%. Both of these rates have improved meaningfully over the last several years. We will continue to invest in our specialty products and expect continued improvement in those penetration rates in the years to come.","While we have significant opportunities in 2018, another key priority during my first 60 days at Anthem has been to align the organization around plans to develop a long-term strategy focused on accelerating our top line and bottom line growth. We need to augment our recent successes in commercial fee business and Medicaid with stronger, profitable growth and higher revenue businesses. We are building an organization with an agile culture that proactively identifies and engages in new opportunities to drive revenue growth by leveraging our existing capabilities and better packaging our assets in the marketplace. One of those opportunities will be to better leverage the power of our local market presence, which is key to driving change in healthcare. Anthem has best-in-class local market share and we needed to combine that strength with our increased cost of care initiative to drive down the cost of healthcare for our members, while also delivering a more consumer focused experience and continuing to build on our depth of experience in provider collaboration and integrated care. Success in these priorities will accelerate our growth, improve affordability for our customers and strengthen our financial performance as we enhance our competitive position.","Anthem also has quite a few unique assets that we are focused on packaging to better deploy in the market. A great example is our AIM Specialty Health subsidiary, which provides a variety of medical cost management provide our workflow integration and member engagement solutions to its customers and supports evidence-based care and affordability across all major clinical areas, including oncology, cardiology, advanced imaging, genetic testing, specialty RX and several others. Depending on the clinical domain, AIM solutions have been able to provide savings of 10% to 40%. Additionally, our technology platform enables 75% of provider interactions to be electronic with a user satisfaction rate of 95%. By better organizing our existing assets as well as investing in or acquiring new capabilities, we will be better able to accelerate our top line growth and diversify our revenue base.","In addition, we will continue to work with our Blue partners to explore ways to leverage Anthem\u2019s capabilities to help them improve their product offerings and competitive position. We have a unique opportunity to cultivate strategic partnerships with our Blue Plan colleagues to grow and advance the impact of the Blue system as a whole. We will also continue our strong focus on becoming a more consumer-centric company. Anthem has made some meaningful improvement to the consumer experience, which drives loyalty and helps to make the healthcare experience simpler for individual. For example, we have been focused on improving the visual clarity and usefulness of our member communication and have deployed a real-time notification feature to help inform our members of key updates like the status of a claim. By combining these opportunities with improved integrated medical and pharmacy offering through our new PBM, IngenioRx, we have a unique opportunity to deliver a highly innovative product offering to the market.","We continue to expect our new PBM to deliver at least $4 billion of gross pharmaceutical savings on a run-rate basis once we migrate our enrollment to the new platform by January 1, 2021. We also continue to project that at least 20% of this benefit will accrue to shareholders on a pre-tax basis. Additionally, we will continue to be a strong community partner in the markets we serve through more than 40 million in open community activity. The Anthem Foundation is positively impacting some of the nation\u2019s most pressing health issue. For example, together with the American Heart Association, we are tracking towards doubling cardiac arrest survival rate through hands-only CPR training. To-date, we have trained more than 6.5 million Americans. This is just one example and we believe that it\u2019s important that our members seek Anthem out in the community and making a difference for those that we serve.","As it relates to overall capital deployment, my view is consistent with what you have heard historically. We will prioritize making the necessary investments in the business first, then evaluate with M&A opportunities exist in the market, and then finally deploy capital to shareholders through a balanced approach of share buybacks and dividends. I believe a coordinated, thoughtful long-term strategy should drive our M&A plan. We will be very disciplined and how we leveraged the M&A pipeline to help build Anthem for the long-term and evaluate how to strategically position and enhance our current asset base to capitalize on the opportunities of tomorrow.","Our acquisition of HealthSun and pending acquisition of America\u2019s 1st Choice demonstrates this focus. Both of these companies fit well into our larger strategy, well run Medicare assets in strategic locations which we can further grow and scale. As a company, we remain committed to achieving our long-term earnings per share target growth range of upper single to low double-digits with a focus on generating sustainable high-quality earnings. I am optimistic that over time we can move to the upper end of this range. As I played out, our emphasis would be on improving our ability to manage the total cost of care as well as leveraging the capabilities we have to diversify our revenue base leading to improved top line growth. Combining these opportunities with an improved integrated medical and pharmacy offering through IngenioRx with very competitive economics will position Anthem very well for growth. Finally, we will focus on being efficient and effective stewards of shareholder capital.","With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our 2017 financial results in more detail. John?","John Gallina","Thank you, Gail and good morning. As Gail mentioned, our strong fourth quarter 2017 results came in ahead of expectations and we entered 2018 with positive operating momentum. Fourth quarter 2017 GAAP earnings per share was $4.67 and adjusted earnings per share was $1.29. During the fourth quarter, we recorded $1.1 billion one-time non-cash deferred tax benefit as a result of the recently passed tax reform legislation. For the full year 2017, GAAP earnings per share, was $14.35 and adjusted earnings per share was $12.04 representing growth of 9.5% over 2016. The results are within our longer term targeted range and we are optimistic that we can build on this performance and drive towards the upper end of our targeted range.","Membership came in slightly ahead of expectations primarily driven by our fully insured business as we finished the year with over 40.2 million members representing growth of 325,000 members during 2017. Fully insured membership finished 2017 with 15.3 million lives, a slight increase over the prior year and a little ahead of our latest projections. The better-than-expected enrollment was primarily driven by higher membership gains in the Medicaid business and approximately 40,000 HealthSun members, which closed at the end of the fourth quarter. Year end 2017 self-funded membership totaled $25 million representing growth of $278,000 or 1.1% versus the end of 2016. The increase over the last 12 months was mainly driven by growth in our local group business as our market leading medical cost value proposition continues to drive new account wins in the marketplace.","Our 2017 operating revenue of $89.1 billion grew by $4.9 billion or 5.8% during the year. The increase is reflective of our enrollment growth, especially in Medicare and local group as well as premium increases across their business to cover overall cost trends. These factors more than offset the decrease in revenue from the waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. Our 2017 medical loss ratio came in at 86.4%, an increase of 160 basis points from the prior year. The ratio for the year was better than previously expected driven primarily by our continued focus on cost of care improvements. We saw better-than-expected medical loss ratios in our individual ACA compliant and Medicaid businesses during the fourth quarter.","Our Local Group insured medical cost trends for the year was approximately 6.5%. I want to highlight that we are updating the reporting of our underlying local group medical cost trend in 2018. We will now report trend based on the allowed amount, which represents a contractual rate due to providers where the amount is paid by Anthem or our members through co-pays and deductibles. The previous methodology was based on paid amount, which is the allowed amount less the co-pays and deductibles, representing only amounts paid by Anthem. This revised methodology is a better indicator of overall healthcare cost and trend. On this basis, the company anticipates Local Group medical cost trend will be in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points in 2018. On an apples-to-apples basis, Local Group medical cost trends would have been approximately 5.5% in 2017 under this methodology.","The 2017 full year SG&A expense ratio came in at 14.2%, 70 basis points lower than 2016 mainly due to the 1-year waiver of the health insurance tax. The ratio for the year was higher than previous expectations driven by incremental investment spending during the fourth quarter and higher incentive compensation expense from the better than expected financial performance.","Now, turning to our business unit financial results, our commercial business finished 2017 strong, with operating revenues of $40.8 billion for the year, an increase of $2.1 billion or 5.3% in 2016. Commercial membership finished the year with 30.7 million members, an increase of 278,000 or 0.9% over the prior year end. This increase was mainly driven by growth in our Local Group business in both fully insured and self-funded products. These increases were partially offset by lower enrollment in our national business and the expected decrease in our individual business. Our individual enrollment declined by 108,000 during the quarter which was in line with our expectations. We ended 2017 with 1.6 million total individualized of which 1.3 million were ACA compliant and a little less than 300,000 were non-ACA compliant. Of the 1.3 million ACA compliant lives, a little more than 850,000 of them were from the public exchanges.","The operating margin in commercial for the year was 7.1%, a decrease of 120 basis points from the 2016 ratio. This decrease as discussed was mainly driven by the impact of the 1-year waiver of the health insurance tax, partially offset by better than expected medical cost trends in our local group and individual businesses. The claims experienced in our individual ACA compliant business is better than expected during the fourth quarter. As a result our business was slightly profitable during the year, better than the relatively breakeven performance we have expected in our latest outlook.","Now turning to the government business, we ended 2017 with 9.6 million members, growth of 87,000 lives during the quarter and 47,000 during the year. We are pleased that our Medicare membership grew by 107,000 lives including approximately 40,000 members from the recently completed HealthSun acquisition. Excluding HealthSun, we grew our individual Medicare advantage enrollment by 68,000 with 13.5% during 2017. Total operating revenue in the government business was $48.3 billion for the year, an increase of $2.8 billion or 6.2% versus 2016. The increase in revenue was driven by premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends, the full year impact of membership growth in our Medicaid business during 2016 and enrollment gains in our Medicare advantage business. The government operating margin for the full year 2017 was 3%, which is 90 basis points lower than the prior year.","Fourth quarter operating margins of 2.9% reflect better than expected claim trends in our Medicaid business, partially offset by the previously discussed timing impact of retroactive revenue adjustments that were made in the third quarter that were originally expected to occur in the fourth quarter. In Iowa, we continue to work with our state partners in CMS to ensure rates for the July 2017 and 2018 period are actuarially sound and appropriately address any new members from the AmeriHealth exit. Additionally, we are very focused on making sure our July 1, 2018 rate increase is actuarially sound and establishes a path to target profitability.","Moving to the balance sheet, consistent with our past practice we have included a roll forward of the medical claims payable balance in this morning\u2019s press release. For the full year 2017, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $1.2 billion, which was better than expected. Our reserves continued to include a provision for average deviation in the mid to high single-digits and believe our reserve balances remain consistent and strong as of December 31, 2017. Our days in claims payable is 39.4 days in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 1.1 days from the 40.5 days we reported in the third quarter. The decrease was driven by operational improvements on our claims processing systems where we continue to focus our efforts on improving the payment integrity and increasing our auto adjudication rates leading to improve cycle times. As a result of these and other ongoing efforts, we believe our DCP will continue to trend down and be in the high-30s over time.","We ended 2017 with a debt to cap ratio of 42.9%, an increase of 440 basis points from the 38.5% we reported at the end of the third quarter. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of a $5.5 billion debt offering during the quarter at an average coupon rate of 3.5%. During the quarter we did use some of those funds to complete a cash tender offer allowing us to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of higher coupon debt including the entire 7% notes that were due in 2019. The debt raised in the quarter was also used to complete the HealthSun acquisition and will fund the America\u2019s 1st Choice acquisition upon closing. We plan to decrease our debt to capital ratio over time back towards the low-40s.","We ended the quarter with cash and investments of the parent company of $2.8 billion, which included the timing impact of approximately $900 million of inter-company funding range. Excluding the timing impact, which was resolved early in the year cash and investments at the parent company would have totaled $3.7 billion. For cash flow, we reported operating cash flow for the full year 2017 of $4.2 billion or 1.1x net income. Cash flow in the fourth quarter was negative $1.3 billion as expected driven by several timing items including the timing of monthly CMS Medicare receipts as discussed on our third quarter call and the payment of provider capitation pass-through funding, which was received in the third quarter. We also used $179.5 million during the quarter for our cash dividend. Yesterday, our Board of Directors increased our first quarter dividend by $0.05 to $0.75 per share and we continue to pay industry leading dividend. We have increased our dividend every year since we began paying a dividend 8 years ago.","With that, I will turn the call back to Gail to discuss our 2018 outlook. Gail?","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks John. Before I begin, it\u2019s important to note that our 2018 outlook does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of America\u2019s 1st Choice, which we continue to expect to close during the first quarter. We expect operating revenues to grow to a range of $90.5 billion to $91.5 billion in 2018, reflecting the impact of the return of the health insurer fee in 2018. Premium rate increases to cover overall medical cost trends and growth in higher revenue PMPM insured membership in the government business. These will be partially offset by the impact of reducing our footprint in the individual ACA compliant marketplace. In total, we expect our enrollment in 2018 to be relatively flat to down a little more than 200,000. In government, we expect another year of solid growth with membership expected to increase by more than 600,000 consumers served. However, we expect commercial membership to decrease by about 700,000 members, because of our reduced individual ACA compliant footprint.","We expect Medicaid to add about 500,000 lives reflecting the recently announced Minnesota partnership as well as organic growth from existing contracts. During the year, we also expect to be active participants in various RFPs. With our Medicare business, we are projecting growth of approximately 125,000 members, primarily, in our individual Medicare advantage product offering to an increasing percentage of enrollment in 4-star plans. This represents individual Medicare advantage growth in the mid double-digits and has fast driven the overall market average of 6% to 9%. In commercial insured, we project our enrollment will decline by a little more than 1 million members over the next 12 months.","Our individual ACA and non-ACA compliant enrollment is expected to decline by approximately 950,000, reflecting the actions we took to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level of confidence that the financial performance in these markets is predictable. Finally, our local group insured enrollment is expected to decrease by about 50,000 lives as a result of funny conversions from fully insured to self funded, as employers look to lessen the impact of rate increases resulting from the return of the health insurer fee. The decrease in commercial fully insured will be partially offset by the growth in commercial self-funded enrollment, which is expected to increase by approximately 300,000 lives in 2018 with positive momentum in securing new contract wins and maintaining retention rates in national accounts and large group employers. We expect our BlueCard enrollment will be down slightly year-over-year.","Turning to the financial metrics, the return of the health insurer fee in 2018, impacts all of our major financial metrics. Such a comparison to 2017 on a reported basis this will be distorted. We expect our 2018 consolidated MLR to be 84.5% at the midpoint, a decrease of 190 basis points versus 2017 largely reflecting the impact of the return of the health insurer fee. Aside from the fee impact, our MLR outlook is flat to slightly better than 2017. Our outlook reflects the impact of an intensified focus on driving down the cost of care across our businesses, while maintaining a disciplined approach to pricing. Also profitability in our individual ACA-compliant business is projected to improve towards our targeted margin range as a result of the pricing and participation strategies deployed in 2017. These improvements are partially offset by a change in the mix of premium revenue coming from the government business, which is the higher MLR than the consolidated average. We expect our SG&A ratio in 2018 to be 15.5% at the midpoint, an increase of 130 basis points from the 14.2% in 2017, which also largely reflects the impact of the return of the health insurer fee. We anticipate using a portion of the corporate tax reform benefits for incremental investment spending as I referenced earlier in the areas of technology modernization efforts, consumer-facing digital technologies and product development capabilities.","Finally, we will continue to incur some cost in our individual ACA-compliant market, which allows us to be positioned to reenter certain markets in 2019 if appropriate. Below the line, we expect investment income of approximately $825 million and interest expense of approximately $775 million. We also expect our tax rate to be in the range of 25.5% to 27.5% for the year, reflecting the impact of the reduced corporate tax rate partially offset by the return of the non-deductible health insurer fee.","Operating cash flow is expected to be relatively consistent with 2017 at greater than $4 billion. As we discussed previously, 2017 operating cash flows were positively impacted by the financial reinsurance receipt related to 2016 claims and the timing of incentive compensation payments. Partially offsetting these headwinds to cash flow in 2018 is the net cash benefit of corporate tax reform as well as increased core earnings. We also expect 2018 will benefit from the impact of share repurchase activity in both 2017 and 2018. As a reminder, our 2017 share repurchase activity was more heavily weighted towards the back half of the year and our 2018 activity will look more normalized throughout the year.","Our outlook assumes we repurchased approximately $1.5 billion worth of shares during 2018. We do have certain equity units that will be issued in May of 2018 and our outlook currently expects the repurchase activity we have committed to in 2018 to more than offset the dilution impact of the equity issuance. As a result, we now expect our average share count for the year to be in the range of 260 million to 264 million shares. We will continue to evaluate the best use of available capital for deployment during the year to strategically position Anthem for long-term growth.","Overall, the reduction of our corporate tax rate to 21% will drive a gross tax benefit of a little less than $4 per share and our outlook expects a net benefit of about $2 per share. The difference between these two numbers reflects two items. First, we expect higher MLR rebates and pass-backs in Medicaid and certain other refunding contracts. Additionally, roughly 25% of the gross tax benefit is funding the incremental investment priorities we laid out for you earlier.","To conclude, our 2018 GAAP earnings per share estimate is greater than $14.28 and our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $15. The difference between these two estimates is the exclusion of the amortization of deal-related intangibles.","With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Hi, everybody. Welcome to Board Gail. Best wishes in the new role there. I was going to jump off of some of your comments about strategy in two quick areas to ask about. First, you touched a little bit on the IngenioRx stand up. I wondered if you would highlight what you are looking for in terms of milestones to know that is on track, any opportunities or challenges, which you see in that or maybe looking at it with fresh eyes would highlight and then aspect about it with the selling season for 2019 to 2020, I know most of it happens in 2020, 2021, but I am wondering given 3-year contracting, how fast do you think you guys would get engaged in actually marketing the capabilities to try to win outside accounts?","Gail Boudreaux","Well, great. Good morning, A.J. and thank you for the comment. First, let me address your overall comments on IngenioRx and my thoughts, but then I am going to ask Brian Griffin who leads that area to also add his commentary on it. First and foremost, as I think about the Ingenio contract with CBS, it\u2019s quite frankly great value creator for us. As I shared in my opening comments, our ability to deliver greater than $4 billion of gross savings with 20% of that on a pretax basis incurring to our shareholders just really incredible opportunity for us. Our opportunity here is really first and foremost to focus on execution. We have got a lot of optionality in that contract and I remain very confident in our ability to execute on that across our book of business. We have been very focused on that. We want to see a flawless execution. But I think I will do that was ask Brian maybe to comment a little bit more about how the team has been working together and our outlook for the future on that.","Brian Griffin","Thanks very much Gail. Good morning A.J. At this point, I would just \u2013 I am very impressed with where the level of commitment that we are seeing out of the CVS relationship. They have been very engaged with us. They have had their senior leadership team directly engaged in the planning process. And I have been also very impressed with the dedicated resources that they are putting into IngenioRx dedicated division. Relative to the implementation itself, in terms of success factors as you can appreciate, we are building out a very detailed implementation plan that will to Gail\u2019s point put us in a position to realize the value that we have discussed starting 1120. And in terms of key metrics, obviously we are going to be looking at things like the testing environments ensuring that we have got interfaces across our systems and doing the appropriate user testing to ensure our claims adjudication is well-positioned, well in advance of the implementation itself, including parallel processing, etcetera. So without getting too detailed in terms of the implementation process itself that detailed implementation plan where we are going to be finalizing over the next several quarters and then we will start to look at metrics against that implementation plan, but with a very heavy focus on testing itself.","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks Brian. I would just add A.J. we have been also building our own PBM capabilities here. So we are standing up our own model in addition to working very closely with them on the execution of the transition of the membership. So overall feel that things are progressing very well and we feel very confident about this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold","Hi there, welcome back Gail. Could you talk a little bit about these partnerships with the Blues and I am particularly interested in how the economics might work for that particularly on the Medicaid side and then separately how are you thinking about association health plans and the impact they might have on your small group business? Thanks.","John Gallina","Good morning Christine. Let me address the first question around the partnerships that we have with the \u2013 our Blue partners, strategic partnership. As I have come back to the Blues, one of the things that clearly I have seen in my time with a healthcare service company is understanding the strength of the Blues overall and the partnerships and strategic opportunities we have. We have a very, very strong Medicaid platform in our Amerigroup presence. And we have formed over five of these partnerships not only with Blue with other health plans and basically what we are doing is leveraging the strength of our platform in Medicaid with the local market expertise and their relationships in the provider network. So that\u2019s been a really strong opportunity for us. It allows us to leverage our investments and quite frankly our return on capital for an investment that that we think gives us greater presence and depth in the marketplace. We also have some other capabilities and I have been really impressed by some of the other assets that we have inside of Anthem for example our AIM subsidiary that I shared with you is another great opportunity that I see an ability to package that, to continue to scale it and invest in capabilities. And we already do a lot of that work with other Blues across the system. And again that\u2019s another great opportunity for us to have I think very strong strategic partnership. In terms of the association health plan, I think quite frankly there is a positive for expanding access for consumers across the space and so we are very supportive of that. We do have expertise in working in different types of association businesses across our book, so it\u2019s something that will continue to innovate our products, but overall I feel pretty positively about our small book of group of business because we are doing quite a bit of work on affordability, obviously our brand presence and also offering new products in that marketplace. So overall I think it gives us another option for consumers and it gives us an option to continue to put additional products in the market with association health plans.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg","Good morning, just wanted to touch on the tax reform investment spending and then tax reform generally, I guess first I think you are saying you are going to spend about $260 million-ish on investment spending this year, I was just wondering is that something you see in the base line over the long-term or something you would expect to dial back. And then separately with the tax reform you heard some chatter out of New York and California about seeking ways to potentially claw back some of the benefit over time, would love to just get your thoughts on that? Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks for the question Chris. Just a couple things first is as John I think and I shared about 25% of the tax benefit is going into acceleration of investments that are predominantly focused on growth. I see some pretty significant opportunities to one simplify our business in terms of system migrations and getting us to our destination platforms plus investing in digital capabilities and product development modularization. And those are things that we had started already and that we are continuing to accelerate. But I will let John maybe give a little bit more color on the overall picture and how we are thinking about the tax.","John Gallina","Yes. Thank you and good morning Chris. So in terms of the tax reform maybe I will just spend a minute going through some of the dynamics associated with it. It\u2019s really a good thing when you have lower taxes that can really help drive affordability in the marketplace and share that with the members and the consumers. And of the gross benefit that we will receive from the tax reform in 2018. About 25% of that is going to go back to the customers directly either through MR rebates or just the true up of how the health history works and things like that. And then as you said maybe another 25% associated with accelerating investments as Gail talked about. And then the remaining 50% I guess return to the shareholders. Your question specifically associated with is our investment strategic priority to the new model, tax reform has allowed us to accelerate our investment spending and growth initiatives. And we will continue to have an ongoing focus in investing in growth and adding to our market leading capabilities. As we look at our uses of capital reinvesting in the business is always something that\u2019s a very, very high on the list and something that we believe we need to continue to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. And I will Echo the comments, welcome to the new role Gail as well. I wanted to ask just first on the Medicare advantage acquisitions just looking at the cash flow statement it looks like you did about $2 billion for HealthSun maybe there is some other true up type of stuff in there, but obviously that screens as a big number for 40,000 lives, so could you talk a little about more of the capabilities, I assume there is some provider business in their, etcetera. And then just I would be curious I know it\u2019s hard to say explicitly on a call like this, but from your perspective on the management side, do you think there is a need for augmentation or more changes and I would be interested to get your sense on the Anthem team working together, historically it\u2019s been geographically diverse management team, I am curious if there is thoughts to get people closer together?","Gail Boudreaux","Well, good morning and thank you. Two questions in there. Let me start with the management team and then I will touch on HealthSun NFP also to provide some commentary. First, I have spent the last 75 days since joining Anthem really meeting with our leaders and our managers across the country and my assessment is we have a strong leadership team with a deep understanding of the business. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to meet many of them and I look forward quite frankly to engaging with all of our leaders, that\u2019s something that I am going to continue to do over the next several months and through the course of time. Part of that is we are going to continue to invest in our leaders as we build the new capabilities that I have discussed and we will also be adding talent in those areas as we are going to be investing in some areas around consumer focused and digital capabilities and we will add talent to those areas. But overall I do feel that we have a strong team in place today. In terms of how they work together, I think we have a really unique opportunity and that\u2019s why I am pretty excited actually about the opportunity to focus on execution and growth. And as I think about the strong brand our local market presence part of bringing that together, which actually has begun already and leveraging that with some scale opportunity. So, I see that as really a blending of taking advantage of our market presence and our leadership in those markets with also bringing scale and discipline from our corporate offices and our segment leadership. So I actually see a nice balance there and I think we have got a real opportunity on continuing to focus on execution at the market level bringing new products and new capabilities. And again, I am very bullish about Medicare, Medicare and our commercial penetration and feel good about our leaders.","In terms of your second question, I will start my commentary on that a little bit, because I think it plays into the strong growth I feel that we have in the Medicare space. Over the last several years, Anthem has been investing in really repositioning Medicare and you will see from the results as over 70% of our members right now are in 4-star plans plus we have 5-star plans, which is very unique among competitors in the space and two of those are in Florida. HealthSun really gave us the nice footprint along with America\u2019s 1st Choice and gave us scale in that key Florida marketplace. And it\u2019s more than just the health plan and the members, obviously, it gives us clinical capabilities in the market and a deep penetration and an opportunity to really leverage some of the work that\u2019s been done in that community. But before I go into too much detail, let me ask Pete to comment, because he leads that business and I think he can give you some great color on what\u2019s happening.","Pete Haytaian","Thanks a lot, Gail and good morning Josh. Yes, I will just reiterate what Gail said in large part we are really excited about this transaction and a key geography for us Florida, which we think is a really important Medicare Advantage market. Don\u2019t think about this transaction in isolation of 40,000 members as Gail talked about and you mentioned Josh in terms of capabilities included in the HealthSun transaction are 19 wholly-owned care centers. We are very focused on managing the chronically ill. We talked about that being a very important part of our business going forward managing the chronically ill effectively as well as managing dual eligibles. And then I will add obviously a high-quality asset, one of the few companies nationally that have a 5-star plan. So, we are really excited about this transaction and also the growth opportunities that exist down in South Florida. And with the combination of America\u2019s 1st Choice, we are talking about spanning a lot of the state of Florida both in the central part of the state as well as in southern part of the state.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, thanks. Just want to go back to taxes for a minute do you have any thoughts today as to the sustainability of the $2 per share into the future years? And then I guess the HIF in coming back in 2018, but not in 2019 I guess one of your competitors talked about that actually being a headwind in 2018, I was wondering if you factor that into this guidance as well?","John Gallina","Yes, thank you, Kevin, this is John. I will answer the first question \u2013 or the second question first on the 2019 HIF being waived and of course we are pleased with the waiver for 2019. As I stated earlier, whenever taxes and regulations decreased and helps with the affordability of healthcare through those premiums and so two pieces on the HIF, so coming into 2018, the HIF came back. And as we had stated, that\u2019s about $0.40 to $0.45 headwind on our growth rate in 2017 and 2018 given how the midyear renewals work and now that\u2019s all processed in. So then when you get into 2018 you do the mid-year renewals from 2018 and 2019 that can actually create a tailwind associated with 2019. So again it\u2019s something that we are going to manage through. And yes all of those things are already included in the guidance that we provided to all comparing in the greater than $15 earnings per share number that Gail had mentioned. In terms of the sustainability of how much of the tax reform can be maintained, it\u2019s really premature to speculate on that at this point in time. We believe we are in a very competitive marketplace that we believe with competition and really the need to drive more affordable products that the savings from the tax reform will help address that in some regards. And we will continue to be opportunistic in terms of reinvesting it in the business associated with accelerating our growth opportunities. And at this point in time, we really can\u2019t put a percentage or a number on a run rate sustainability associated with tax reform.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Hey, congrats Gail, great to see you back. My question is near-term and long-term both on the medical cost trends, in near-term it looks like your guidance is 50 basis points higher apples-to-apples relative to 2017 and is this conservatism or are there any components either pricing or utilization that you are beginning to see pressure we had one of the larger public hospital yesterday to put pretty strong volumes. And then on the medium-term strategically you have had this competitive advantage for a while on cost of care the local market share, there do you think you could go relative to your competition and would that be a pricing advantage, would that be on beds per thousand and might you consider buying doc, so we are starting the three centers is the likely just market share good enough to get to get the leg up?","Gail Boudreaux","There is a lot of questions in there Ana. So thank you. I will try to parse through them and hopefully we will get to each of them. Let me first start with where our trend finished and then a little bit of our guidance or actually ask John to give his commentary to. We finished 2017 at 5.5% under our \u2013 under the new methodology which essentially was at the low end of our guidance range. And we put in a intense focus on managing costs overall. So cost of care initiatives across investments in those across our business. But I think more than just specific cost of care, we have had a big commitment to integrated care and really moving value based payments along across our continuum of care providers and that has been a differential for us. And I believe Anthem has been a leader in that front and that\u2019s an area that we continue to invest in across our business. As we think about our forward view of trend we are always obviously very prudent about how we think about the forward view of trend. And we have given you a trend of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points taking into consideration this year we obviously have a more intense flu season than we have had in the past, so that\u2019s baked into our assumptions. And as we look at trend overall, basically placing it we do have very detailed drill down of each of the components of inpatient and outpatient pharmacy, etcetera. And at this stage what we are seeing is roughly at the midpoint about a 50 basis point increase and obviously we \u2013 that\u2019s something that we continue to watch across all of our businesses. In terms of your other question about care delivery assets one of the things that I would like to point out in the assets that I had the opportunity to spend time with is our CareMore assets. I am not sure if people know how much that we use that asset in our government business right now, we have seen some very, very strong results in terms of managing our more acute populations not only in Medicare, but have also expanded it to our Medicaid population. And we are expanding that model to not just be facility based, but also at home and at the workplace. So we think that asset gives us a really nice footprint to expand upon, to continue to scale and it has delivered some strong results in terms of readmission rates managing our most acute population, integration of behavioral and social elements and recently kicked off a program around isolation and loneliness nationally across that platform. So there is some very, very good work going on in CareMore. So, I feel between our integration of our value-based payments what we are doing there integrated care as well as our provider enablement and then what we do through CareMore and now our clinics down in the Florida market that we have a really nice footprint upon which to grow. But I will turn it over to John maybe to give a little bit more color on sort of the numbers around our trend guidance.","John Gallina","Yes, thank you, Gail and good morning, Ana. In terms of the trend, I do want to just clarify we changed the metric in terms of how we calculated from a paid basis to an allowed basis. That has no impact on our pricing methodologies. It has no impact on our reserving. It has no impact on our financial statement issues. It is really a metric that is utilized to discuss healthcare trend and we believe that this change really provides a better view of healthcare trend overall to look at it on allowed basis versus paid basis. But with that as Gail said, we are at the very low end of our range in 2017 really driven by lower than expected increases in AWP with the cognizant effort to tighten up our formulary during the year, lower than expected hepatitis C spending and lower utilization trends overall. Of course, we did have the bump of the flu here at the end of the fourth quarter and then we are heading into 2018 really the single biggest drivers for the 50 basis points that we are looking at raising it at the midpoint of our range. Really the AWP pricing is going up a little bit faster than the overall trend and taken the flu into consideration. Now, all in though, everything else we believe is a very well controlled trend and we are really returning to a more of a normalization process. Thank you for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Yes, good morning. Congratulations Gail on the role. Great to speak with you again. Just I have two quick questions really strategic in nature. One is further on the care delivery side and just thinking about your value-based care strategy and trying to understand if your market share makes it easier and more attractive or less attractive to own providers in those markets? And then the second question is really related to your cross-selling efforts and focus in particular in the self-insured market and trying to understand where you think the biggest opportunities there are and what are some other capabilities that you need to add to be able to sell into that market? So thanks a lot.","GailBoudreaux","Great, Lance. Thanks again for the question. Again two questions. Let me take the first one around our capabilities and market share, which you appropriately referenced. Absolutely, that market share has an impact on our ability to drive best-in-class medical costs and I think that\u2019s actually a very important component of it. And we have had I think fairly comprehensive approach of value-based incentives all the way from gain shares through full risk-sharing and our primary approach is enablement with the providers and partnership, because we feel that\u2019s the right approach in the marketplace. Another market as I have mentioned we also are augmenting that certainly in the Florida market with the clinics now that is the more standard of how things are done and then with our CareMore model across the country. So, I think it\u2019s a combination for us of what best fits the marketplace as opposed to one stated strategy. We do have an overarching strategy around moving to more value-based payment. We are over 60% now and we would expect to move to over 70% going forward and continue to work with providers.","In terms of your second question, specialty penetration, we have been investing in the capabilities and have seen a nice improvement in the penetration rates of our dental and vision business, in particular. I shared that on my opening prepared remarks. Our investments there are really on product, product positioning, technology, broker support sales effectiveness. Obviously even with the penetration rate improvements we have had we think that there is a significant upside there that we can continue by different businesses to increase that penetration rate significantly. I will ask Brian Griffin who leads again that area maybe to give a little bit of commentary about the kinds of things that we have been working on and what he is seeing in the marketplace. Brian?","Brian Griffin","Thanks, Gail. Good morning. In terms of the \u2013 Lance, your question around the specialty, to Gail\u2019s point, we\u2019ve had significant success in really driving specialty penetration across all of our key products. I think you have seen that and we have talked about that in previous calls relative to dental and vision. To Gail\u2019s point, I do believe that there is incremental opportunity specifically around our life and disability products, I think that there is more that we can do there. Obviously, we talked earlier about pharmacy and we are seeing significant interest in the integrated value proposition in medical and RX together, particularly in our large group and national account marketplace. That message seems to be resonating significantly in those markets. And I think we have a unique value proposition that we can bring to market up. Obviously, you have heard me talk about that, but we are seeing at this point given where we are in the implementation of our own PBM significant interest there in that value proposition. I think actually that will help us more broadly across all of our products, because we can then begin to think about integrated value propositions across dental vision and pharmacy altogether in a single package. So, I think to Gail\u2019s point there is quite a bit that we can do in terms of the repackaging of our value proposition to drive that penetration rate.","The other key investment the Gail alluded to is we made a really significant investment in our broker portal, which is really designed to allow the brokers to more efficiently compare plan designs, various products. It brings in our specialty products into that evaluation and it just makes it candidly easier to do business with us in that regard and allows them to look at the full product suite that we bring to both small group and large group. So, that was an investment that we see paying off. We are getting great reaction from the broker community and I think we will get deeper penetration rates as a result of it.","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks for your questions. Next please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. Gail, can you maybe talk about the competitive landscape obviously big vertical deal in the space, maybe just broad thoughts about opportunity maybe near-term during potential disruption there and maybe longer term sort of the comfort with the margin profile, particularly within commercial risk? And then just your position again as we sort of see models evolve that seemed to offer a lot more than largely an insurance product in terms of your position or where you would like to be positioned there? Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks, Ralph. Let me try to get through the different parts of your question in terms of the landscape and I will go back to where I started I think again in my remarks and then I think we have significant opportunity for growth across all of our businesses. And as I think about the competitive landscape, I think we are actually fairly well positioned. I am going to be intensely focused on the execution of the capabilities we are investing in growth, we are investing in product modularization, so we can get product to market more quickly and that we can be simpler in terms of how we face off externally to our clients and brokers and customers and more agile.","In terms of the overall market space, I will start with what where I think we have a significant opportunity is the Medicare space. We have been historically underpenetrated in the Medicare Advantage individual market. Our acquisitions give us some nice scale and we had a very strong open enrollment and we will continue I think to do very well in the dual eligible market. We have got strong capabilities, a strong star rating and those will help position us well and so we see that as the significant growth. The other area that I haven\u2019t talked about is the group Medicare market. That\u2019s an area that we really have not participated in that extensively in the past. We have been investing in that area to build our capabilities. And I think that we are going to see very strong enrollment going forward because of quite frankly the strong Blue brand resonates very well with that marketplace and we do think we have an opportunity to also have agents from our current book of business or commercial book to keep the Blue brand into Medicare. So, that\u2019s one strong area of growth and I think we are well positioned competitively in that market. And we have been \u2013 and our margins have been improving in that marketplace and it\u2019s again the area of investment and certainly having a 4-star 70% this year and 4-star helps in that regard.","In the Medicaid side, I do think we have a best-of-breed asset and we will continue to compete for RFPs. We do see an opportunity with an $80 billion pipeline to compete in the specialized services marketplace. Again, our CareMore assets are really interesting opportunity for us there, because it allows us to take some of the most acute and ill population and really managed their care to deliver extraordinary results both in cost of care, but also in outcomes for those patients. So, that\u2019s an opportunity. We are expanding that into the Medicaid population. And then we also talked about the partnerships that we recently formed and we think that we have recently formed and we think that there will be more opportunity for those partnerships across other plans as well as our Blues - Blue brother.","On the commercial side again the margin profile there, I think we have market leading commercial market share, but I think there\u2019s an opportunity for us to do more and I see that opportunity again with leveraging our Blue brand, but also leveraging our local market expertise with greater ability to put new product into the market improve our digital facing capabilities and streamline how we work with each of the partners that we have in those investments that we started making and we\u2019re accelerating those as part of our outlook into 2018. Again, we have very, very solid margin profile and I feel good about our ability to manage medical costs and our focus really is on affordability and access for consumers. So that will continue to be there is a priority and then finally again going back to some of the other assets, that I\u2019ve seen inside of Anthem, which I don\u2019t think as well known game we have an opportunity again to invest in scale those across the system may already delivering good value and I think we can evening increase and enhance those more. So overall I\u2019m pretty, pretty positive about the competitive environment, obviously we are in a very competitive environment there is many players in our space in each of the markets that I shared, but I feel good about our positioning and where we\u2019re heading in the future and our opportunity to continue to enhance and focus our execution. Thank you for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Tanal","Good morning, guys. Thanks \u2013 thanks for the question and congrats Gail on the new role. Just wanted follow-up on sort of discussion around value-based contract being and kind of thoughts and the opportunity moving forward. So 60% penetration so it sounds like a high number, it also sounded like the mix maybe those arrangements are bit lower on the risk factor. I was wondering, if you could kind of frame the opportunity from sort of earnings perspective and then what inning you would say were in overall and I guess just relatedly, but little bit separate here. Should we expect to see you guys moving into the provider space in a bigger way and maybe the localities are states where were your shares highest?","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks for the question, Steve. In terms of it\u2019s a great way to frame what inning when I think \u2013 we think about that a lot and I would say it\u2019s probably early innings and truth across the entire industry. We\u2019re all looking for ways to find greater affordability and drive I think more integrated care. And so we have as you can imagine a breath of relationships across our market and we try to meet the care provider community where they are, we would love to see them be willing to take a more risk and part of where we\u2019re investing is also in provider enablement capability. So I would say, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on a building those relationships and moving them from you maybe just to gain share to taking more upside downside risk to more fully participation. But again we also realize that some that \u2013 that\u2019s not going to be perfect for each of the \u2013 the care providers that we work with and they have to come along and feel comfortable about the relationship. In terms of our focus on where we are focused on our best use of capital to drive value and we do think the partnership model makes sense, again we do own some assets ready and we feel good about those, we\u2019ll continue to invest in those, because we see the real return that they aren\u2019t but some overall, we\u2019re going to look to leverage the best use of capital in the markets, where we are and one of the advantages that we have is our deep market share. So partnerships can work because, we have deep market share across all of the businesses, we serve in we see that as a real opportunity.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks for squeezing me and I\u2019ll add my welcome and congratulations to Gail as well. First to follow-up on the PBM, Gail, the company has done a good job of laying out the earnings benefit from retaining the 20% of savings to the bottom line, but you also going to be returning $3 billion or more here to customers. And I was hoping you could flush out your view of how your top line could benefit from the significant improvement in competitive positioning that should come here? And then my core question is what are the 2 or 3 areas that we should be focused on that are going to drive the shift at the higher end of your earnings target that you talked about and over what time period? Thank you.","Gail Boudreaux","Let me take your second half of your question first, Justin and then I\u2019ll start with the PBM and I\u2019ll ask Brian also to give his commentary. In terms of what will drive, where we look to be at the top end of our earnings per share guidance, I think it\u2019s the growth opportunities that I\u2019ve outlined that the opportunity in Medicare both group and individual, the opportunity in partnerships to leverage our capital effectively in Medicaid. And I also see opportunities in commercial. The other area that I think has really been underleveraged is of the existing assets. So, the assets that we have a name in CareMore to leverage those in the marketplace across other Blues and form real strategic partnerships, so I see that giving us the lift and I think just much more detailed execution on the initiatives that we have had I think give us a really nice pathway to the type of growth that we are looking for across our business. In terms of the PBM questions, I am going to ask Brian maybe to comment on those directly, because I know he has been very directly involved in all of this.","Brian Griffin","Good morning, Justin. Just I guess tied back to my commentary on Lance\u2019s question, I think with us launching our new PBM and really as a result of that taking full control over all the key financial levers, I think that really puts us in a very different competitive position moving forward. Our focus through Ingenio is really on better overall health outcomes. And I think that\u2019s very different than the way that the PBM industry has looked at that. I think that there has been a focus on driving pure rebate optimization as opposed to a focus on total healthcare costs. But I think as I mentioned earlier, our integrated value proposition is really resonating out in the market. And I think as a result of that that positions us really nicely for growth both in terms of our local business, but our national ASO business. My vision for Ingenio is really to become a utility within the Blue system as well and we have seen interest in that regard that\u2019s already developing. And I think we are building our own platform that really meets the needs of other Blue plans. So, I see that as a great new opportunity. We have just in executing against our strategy already, we have made significant progress in terms of driving improved values in terms of new formulary designs as well as new network strategies. That will continue to be a focus for us as we launch Ingenio 1120 more broadly. And I think as a result we will be in a better overall competitive position. So, expect us to really focus on growth outside of both within our local markets, local small group and large group and our national account business, but really looking at new ASO standalone pharmacy business as a new market for us as well as that Blue opportunity. And in addition to that additional sets of clinical services that we will be offering through Ingenio that have been developed here at Anthem over the last several years, so we are excited about what the new growth opportunities mean in terms of to your point, obviously, we are going to see significant savings as a result of our new contract position that will flow through to our customers, but then the expanded growth opportunities in these new markets, where historically we haven\u2019t participated.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you, Brian. And I will put a fine point on maybe Justin, just the three things that will really drive volume we see has granted success in our new RX-only RFPs, increasing the penetration rates in our existing medical book of business and being the PBM for other health plans. Those will be three key drivers for us going forward.","Gail Boudreaux","Well, thank you very much everyone for all of your thoughtful questions. As I hope you can tell I am excited to be here at Anthem and the opportunity to advance our strategic priorities to create a healthcare system that\u2019s more affordable and simpler. As I outlined earlier, we will be focused on optimizing execution across our business and ensuring that we leverage our unique assets to strategically position the company for sustainable high-quality earnings growth. I want to thank each of our associates for their commitment to Anthem and for living our values each and every day to deliver on the promises to our consumers. Thank you for your interest in Anthem and I look forward to speaking with you at future events.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management.","Douglas R. Simpson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, and welcome to Anthem's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Joe Swedish, Chairman President and CEO; and Wayne DeVeydt, our CFO. Joe will offer an overview of our first quarter 2016 financial results and will walk through the financials and provide some incremental commentary around our updated 2016 outlook. We are then available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call.","Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. We're pleased to announce first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.46, with membership tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.63.","I'm pleased with our first quarter results, which represent a solid start to 2016 as the company continues to benefit from the growing diversification of our business. The complementary nature of our pending Cigna acquisition will allow us to further advance affordability and quality for our members.","I'm going to start with some overview comments on our first quarter 2016 results and then we'll discuss a few of the key details of our updated 2016 outlook. First quarter results reflect business performance that tracked well versus our expectations. Specifically, membership is exceeding our expectations and we reported strong quality of earnings metrics while maintaining appropriate conservatism on our balance sheet to reflect the dynamic nature of the marketplace that exists today.","Within membership, both fully-insured and self-funded membership are tracking ahead of expectations and we ended the first quarter with 39.6 million members, reflecting growth of 1 million lives or 2.6% since year end 2015.","Specifically, we ended the quarter with 975,000 lives from the Individual public exchanges, an increase of 184,000 from year-end 2015 and ahead of our initial expectations. Our self-funded business grew by 906,000 lives or 3.8% in the quarter to 24.6 million members, which was also ahead of our expectations as the company experienced higher than expected in-group change in current contracts and BlueCard enrollment. Our Local Group insured enrollment declined by just north of 200,000 lives in the quarter and serves approximately 4 million members as of March 31. In particular, we saw higher-than-expected lapses in plans residing in states that transitioned the 51 to 99 key group size into the small group marketplace.","Operating revenue was $20.3 billion in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $1.5 billion or 7.7% versus the first quarter of 2015, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial Business.","The first quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was 81.8%, which increased versus prior year as expected. The 160 basis point increase reflected the impact of an extra calendar day during the quarter from the leap year, a higher benefit expense ratio in the Medicaid and Individual businesses as well as a change in our business mix towards the Government Business division, which carried a higher-than-average benefit expense ratio. While we do not include a reserve roll forward payable in our first quarter press release, it is important to note that yearend 2015 reserves have developed moderately better than our expectations so far in 2016. However, we do not believe our first quarter 2016 financial results benefited from that reserve development and we have maintained an appropriate level of conservatism on our balance sheet as of March 31 for the higher-than-expected Individual enrollment.","Our SG&A expense ratio came in at 15.8% in the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 90 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by a continued focus on administrative expense control in light of better-than-expected enrollment trends, as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business. Supporting the strong quality of earnings in the first quarter, we reported operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion or 1.9 times net income. We continue to expect 2016 operating cash flow to be greater than $3 billion. It is important to note that operating cash flow exceeded our expectations in the quarter, which is encouraging.","Turning to discuss the first quarter financial performance of our business units let me say that in our Commercial Business, we reported strong membership trends that came in well above our conservative expectations, increasing by 880,000 during the quarter. In particular, we saw strong self-funded membership trends in both our National and Local Group businesses and better-than-expected Individual enrollment on the public exchanges. This contributed to the better-than-expected operating revenue during the quarter, which increased by 1.5% versus the prior year to $9.5 billion.","Operating margins were relatively flat compared to the prior quarter at 13.6%, which reflects the impact of a higher benefit expense ratio offset by a lower SG&A expense ratio, as expected. We were diligent with respect to pricing our exchange product offerings for 2016, as this remains a dynamic marketplace. We believe we have taken a conservative posture in the first quarter regarding our expectations for the profitability of this book of business for 2016. We believe we are well positioned for continued growth in exchange lives as this market stabilizes to a more sustainable level over time.","Relating to National Accounts, we're pleased that the team has been able to secure some wins recently that should grow membership in both 2016 and 2017. As we said earlier, Local Group membership was down slightly year-over-year, and we continue to see a funding mix shift away from fully insured. We recognize it is vital to offer affordable products with the right network and benefit design in our markets, and our team is focused on improving the historical trends of this book of business.","Our Government Business segment had another solid quarter adding 123,000 members and growing year-over-year revenue by 13.9% to $10.8 billion. It is important to note that our results do not yet include an impact from the addition of the Iowa contract aside from startup costs incurred in the quarter ahead of the contract launch where the implementation was delayed from March 1 to April 1.","Operating margins for the Government Business in the quarter came in at 3%, a decline of approximately 40 basis points, which was driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we continue to expect Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels to a more normalized level, and we are monitoring the performance of this business appropriately.","Within Medicare, I'm pleased with the progress the team continues to make as our first quarter margins reflect continued improvement versus last year. We continue to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-term sustainable level, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in the right markets with the right products in 2017.","The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial. We expect $68 billion of new business to be awarded by the end of 2020, split about evenly between traditional Medicaid and new populations in specialized services. We continue to believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising healthcare costs and improving quality for their residents.","Regarding our balance sheet metrics, our Days in Claims Payable was 43.4 days as of March 31, an increase of 0.7 days from the 42.7 days as of December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the timing of claims payments driven by the new membership that came online during the quarter. As previously discussed, we expect Days in Claims Payable to come back down closer to 40 over time. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 40.2% at March 31, 2016. Down 60 basis points from the 40.8% as of December 31, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity and the reduction of our outstanding balance in the commercial paper during the quarter.","We ended the first quarter with approximately $2.2 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $639 million as of March 31. For the 3Rs related to the 2015 and 2016 benefit years, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to reflect a net payable position for risk adjusters and a net neutral position for risk corridors. We continue to record a valuation allowance against the risk corridor receivables in certain markets as we do not believe those receivables will ultimately be collected. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information.","Turning to our financial outlook, we've increased our operating revenue expectation for 2016 by $1 billion to between $81 and $82 billion. This increase reflects higher projected membership due to the strong enrollment results seen through the first quarter, as we've discussed.","Fully insured membership is now expected to be approximately 14.9 million members, at the midpoint of our range at yearend, 250,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the Individual and Medicaid businesses.","Self-funded membership is now expected to be approximately 24.5 million members at the midpoint of our range at yearend, also 250,000 higher than our previous outlook. Taken together, we now project our total membership to be approximately 700,000 to 900,000 lives higher than we ended in 2015.","We continue to expect our 2016 medical loss ratio to be 83.6% plus or minus 30 basis points, and now expect our SG&A ratio to be 15.5% plus or minus 30 basis points on a GAAP basis, which includes the impact of Cigna-related transaction cost incurred during the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. We're encouraged with first quarter operating cash flow, and we continue to project operating cash flows to be greater than $3 billion in 2016.","Regarding capital deployment, we raised our dividend during the first quarter by $0.025 per share and declared our second quarter dividend of $0.65 per share. This represents an annualized dividend of $2.60 per share and continues our track record of increasing our dividend every year since it was implemented in 2011.","Our 2016 outlook does include some benefit from the impact of capital deployment activities throughout the remainder of the year. While we did not repurchase any shares through the first quarter, we plan to resume our capital deployment program, subject to market conditions, albeit at a lower level than in recent years.","To conclude, our 2016 earnings per share outlook is greater than $9.65 on a GAAP basis and our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.80. Our outlook continues to take an appropriately conservative posture around the expected financial performance on the public exchanges and the expected year-over-year margin compression in the Medicaid business.","Our outlook does not include the adoption of new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payments, which we expect to implement in 2017. For context, we estimate the impact in the first quarter of 2016 would have been a benefit to GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.10. Our outlook does include an adverse impact of $0.03 for the additional assessment in 2016 associated with the State of Colorado dissolution of their co-op.","It's also important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect this acquisition will close in the second half of this year. It also does not include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI.","With that, operator, please open the queue for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question will come from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody. I figure I might as well just jump in on the public exchanges and ask you a broad question there, three parts to it, I guess. Obviously, you had good enrollment this open enrollment season. Can you give us any thoughts on what you know so far about the risk profile of those sign-ups and how you feel about that? Second, I know last year, your issue really wasn't in terms of dip in profitability on exchanges an MLR issue, it was rather a G&A issue and you've made some adjustments there. Can you sort of update us on what you did there? And then, finally on the exchanges, the 2017 early outlook in light of some of the commentary from some of the others in the sector?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. A.J., thanks for the question. Good morning. This is Joe. First of all, let me just tell you that we're really pleased overall with how our team has been able to navigate the very challenging landscape that has evolved over the last couple of years. As I stated in my remarks, we're really glad to now be serving 975,000 members across all of our markets, which I think really highlights an incredibly meaningful value proposition to the customers that have chosen to align with us. Over time, we do believe we're well positioned for continued growth in the exchange marketplace if the market stabilizes to a more sustainable level. I think that is a key consideration.","Clearly, the performance of the exchange marketplace has lagged expectations throughout the industry, as some of our peers have recognized. And in consideration of that, we are monitoring the market very closely to see that our offerings continue to be, number one, very rational; sustainable for the customers, but also it is built on a platform that is constructed appropriately with respect to the costs that need to drive our presence in that market, again, at a very sustainable and appropriate level.","I think it's really critical for me to underscore that we are actively engaged with our government partners to help build that long-term sustainable model that we believe will ultimately create an affordable marketplace. And, in doing so, we believe we can continue to develop kind of a rate structure in the marketplace that's adequate for us and appropriate in terms of affordability for members.","And, for example, I think the elimination of the health insurer fee in 2014 sets the stage nicely as we move into that new year with respect to a rate picture. And I think our combination with Cigna is going to present a meaningful improvement in affordability for our membership. So I think put all that together, we're very kind of pleased with how we performed this year. We think we're engaged in a fairly sustainable platform that has potential for continued growth, again, underscore, as long as the model that we are engaged in in the marketplace is a sustainable model.","Let me close my remarks in that regard by saying that I think there's some really key drivers to building that sustainable affordable marketplace that I mentioned. Some of the key elements include what has already been put in place for 2017, which is the health insurer tax adjustment. And the second thing would be I think a careful consideration of updating the risk adjustment model, further consideration of special enrollment period adjustments, and that would narrow the variety and number of special enrollment considerations. And we'd like to be able to begin offering some very innovative product designs to the marketplace and hopefully our government partners will be receptive to some of those creative and innovative models.","And, finally, I'd like to underscore a modification of the grace period for nonpayment of premiums to prevent abuse. So when you put all that together in a mosaic, I think maybe a sustainable model can be built and we will continue to perform in the marketplace in a way that continues to maybe try to achieve the membership that we had originally anticipated back when this effort first began in 2014.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Wayne, you may want to speak to the MLR question that A.J. put to us.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, A.J., as Joe addressed at least our views on 2017 and beyond, in terms of the membership we received, I would say we have a slightly higher silver mix, which we think is generally a positive regarding how we price our book and our product. The age distribution and subsidy eligible mix is consistent with those expectations. But I would tell you that we've chosen to maintain a conservative posture in Q1 until we see ultimately how this develops. So we've maintained a conservative posture on risk adjusters despite Wakely data that would imply that we should be booking more.","And we are really not booking to the normal seasonality profitability you would see in this book in a Q1 because, again, I think from our perspective, we'd like to see this membership at least get through 2Q to really understand how the book is performing. So, from that perspective, we think it's the prudent thing to do. And then as 2Q evolves, we'll give more commentary on how it's actually developing.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then just maybe on that part just expanding, I know you talked about pulling back on your marketing and trimming your G&A directly related to the exchanges, you've had better than expected enrollment growth. Did you still pull in on those expense items on the G&A side?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we did. I mean, I think the lesson learned last year 2015 was that we needed to really true up a very nice platform that was appropriately built for the type of market we were dealing with. And, quite frankly, I think we really built a very stabilized platform that helped us move into 2016 to capture this uptake in membership based on a cost structure that I think was very appropriately built out for the marketplace. And so, quite frankly, our G&A structure I think is well under control. It's appropriately sized and well configured for us to continue grow in this space as appropriate.","Operator","And our next question will come from Tom Carroll with Stifel.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the exchange business. Are you seeing any signs of adverse selection at all and maybe could you remind us of kind of the items that you're looking for within that book of business? And then secondly, I would like you to chat a little bit about the Medicaid business. Anthem had a great 2015 and you indicated that the Medicaid MLR was likely going to be up and was up during the first quarter. Was it aligned with your expectations, higher, lower from what you expected? And I wondered if you could comment also on the Medicaid managed care regs that were out on Monday? Thanks.","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Got it. Maybe I can pick back up where I left off regarding A.J.'s question on risk profile, which I think relates back to your question on what are we seeing in terms of membership capture. It's a little early. I think we're going to continue to dig into the risk profile that we have brought on. And our sense is that probably somewhere in the 2Q range we're going to be able to get line of sight on risk profile and have more to report to you at the end of 2Q. So it's a little early for us to give you kind of a line of sight on risk profile.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Tom, a couple of other items. I think, as Joe said, we like what we're seeing in early mix. But ultimately, as this business comes on, we'll see how it really develops in Q2. As you know, a lot of the claims activity always has a little bit of a lag when an individual switches to a new carrier and then ultimately that reporting timeline that occurs with the providers ultimately to us. So I think in 2Q we'll get a much better feel.","What we want you to be aware of is, one, we're not seeing any early indicators across our broader book on trend or anything that would have us change our overall trend assumptions. Two is, we've maintained a conservative posture going into 2Q around the risk-adjusted data, not only for what we believe 2015 would true up to be, but what we think the impact would be on 2016 in light of this mix. That's not based on just our assumptions but actually using the updated Wakely data we receive as well as some recent CMS data. But as you know, ultimate settlement on those will be very dependent upon who owes the risk adjuster and how that will settle out.","So we're going to wait and see how that pans out in 2Q. But I would say on each of these 3Rs, we've maintained a posture that should give us some contingency if the book doesn't develop as we would have expected. And if it does develop as we would expect, then it would give us some upside going into the second half of this year and into Q2.","On the Medicaid front, again, no real surprise. Just a reminder that we had a lot of new markets that we're rolling out. We continue to have that book evolve. As you know, Iowa now starts on April 1 as well. So we would expect to see MLR pressure there in 2Q as well, but consistent with our expectations of new markets that are rolling out and continue to be bullish on the Medicaid top line as well as bottom line. And as we mentioned previously, we're going to be slow landing those margins down to what we think are more sustainable. And then on the Medicaid regs, no real surprises. We were fine with the new regs that came out.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. First question, just on the 975,000 exchange lives, could you help us break down how many of those are new to Anthem versus existing previously managed lives last year? And then any sense of how many of the new ones came from other plans versus sort of new to the market? And then the follow-up would just be on the MLR, up 160 bps in the first-quarter but guidance up 30 bps for the year. I understand the leap year, but what are some of the deltas, what changes as we sort of progress through the year that would make those year-over-year comparisons look much better?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let me take a shot at the first question. We just don't know yet, quite frankly, in terms of what carryover membership is brought over from 2015. Obviously, we're going to learn more about that getting into 2Q. So it's a rather simple answer to the question. I wish I had more to give you, but we just don't know this early.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Josh, a couple other items we would highlight, though, is that generally where we've seen what I would call the unexpected uptake, though, has been markets where the co-ops have become insolvent. So I don't think there's a surprise there. I think where we're probably surprised on the uptake, though, has been that we weren't the next lowest cost carrier. And in many cases, we were substantially higher than the next or several next lowest cost carriers. So there appears to be a little bit of a flight to safety, if you will, and security. And so, again, it's another reason why we want to see how this ultimately pans out.","Our pricing is obviously much higher than what would have been available in the market. And so the question will be does that adequately reflect the book that we're inheriting over from the co-ops on that? And frankly, given how 2015 played out, we want to take a more conservative posture earlier this year and see how that develops.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And you don't know which lives were Anthem members previously and still signed up?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, you ultimately get the data, but I would say that you also have to look at it \u2013 we don't look at it as a single member by state. We look at the broad mix of both on and off exchange membership. And so while we have a feel for some of that, at the same time, I would tell you that the majority of the new membership growth that we're seeing is obviously new to us, and it's coming from other organizations. And clearly, it's in the co-op states.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So do you have like a net sales versus a net lapses number or anything like that, even if you don't know if they're the same?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We do, Josh, but we're obviously not going to disclose that data.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then the MLR year-over-year?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ultimately, we show that \u2013 we had the impact of the leap year in the year. The thing to keep in mind, though, is the premium, as you know, just inherently the leap year alone, that the premium is spread over the entire year, but you're getting a full day of claims within the quarter. So clearly, there's a positive effect that happens in the out-years as the leap year continues. That's one dynamic.","I think another dynamic to keep in mind is that when we look at our mix shift and how that's evolving, we actually didn't do the typical seasonality that you would see for Individuals. So we've tried to book a little more of an MLR factor in the first quarter. That typically would have been lower and then you'd have a higher in the fourth quarter. In this case, because of the new membership, we're doing a little more. I wouldn't call it straight-line, but we're trying to get much more of an upfront view and a conservative posture, as that develops. Again, I would basically put it that we're seeing how 2015 played out. We're just trying to take a much more conservative posture earlier in the year and then let that hopefully blend its way down as the year progresses.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up a little bit and I think, Wayne, your last response kind of gets into my question a little bit, so I'll be brief. But, I guess, I'm trying to understand where the Individual enrollment came. You mentioned a few of the states where the co-ops were insolvent. I was wondering if there was any more detail you could provide than that, particularly whether some of this enrollment would be in states like California, New York where I think your experience was better last year?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Gary, it is. New York is, obviously, clearly one of the markets where the co-ops struggled. And we did pick up, I would say, more than our market share that we typically have relative to the co-ops. California is another market where we did perform well. And in addition, it would be in Colorado and Kentucky, other markets where the co-ops had their difficulties, and I would say we've picked up more than our market share. So the membership available with their exits we're disproportionately picking up market share.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And as a quick follow, I guess, I'm having a little difficulty seeing the degree of conservatism maybe that you're talking about in the book given that's versus the original expectation of Individual being down 300,000, you're now up 200,000, Days in Claims Payable down a couple of days year-over-year, the Commercial operating margin was up 10 basis points even though you booked some additional MLR in the Individual business. Is the response to that just that this Individual seasonality is so skewed to the front end versus the fourth quarter that you still have some modest margin gain year-over-year even though you are booking this additional MLR in the Individual book? Is that maybe just the range of seasonality maybe I'm just not appreciating enough?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Gary. Yes, that's one dynamic. The second one is, sequentially DCP is actually up since year-end, and as we said year-end did develop favorable to our expectation. So I want to emphasize that it developed favorable and DCP is up sequentially. Two is, I think it's important to recognize that on the 3Rs the data would imply that we have been conservative on 2015, and so we've neither recognized that conservatism yet. And in addition to that, it would also imply then a run rate that we would have available to us in 2016 based on that data. And again, we've not recognized that as well, and it's important to recognize that the 3Rs are not part of DCP, so you won't necessarily get to see that added conservatism that we are carrying into Q2 as we move forward.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Will you ever disclose 3Rs? Will we ever get that from you?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Most likely not. But I will tell you that in 2Q we will give you a gauge, though, of how it maybe benefited us more broadly in terms of the pieces. I think the thing I want to highlight for the group, though, is the reason we are being cautious on 3Rs, and in particular risk-adjusters, which would imply that we would have a nice receivable related to 2015 as well as some run rate into 2016 is, the question is similar to the risk corridor, who ultimately is going to pay that? And if the receivables due from a co-op, ultimately we don't want to recognize that unless we know the co-ops have the financial wherewithal to pay those receivables. And so this is just one of many factors that we believe warrants being conservative until we see final settlements and then how those dollars are actually transferred between companies.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I'll move away from the Individual exchanges for a minute and take you to the PBM and the contract dispute with Express. Can you talk, not about what you are going to do but how would you bring it in-house specifically if that was the direction this ends up? Give us an idea of sort of the timeframe it would take from when you have to start planning it as well as what sort of options would you use in terms of perhaps using some of the other PBMs or even Express by buying NextRx back or something like that to actually manage it given that you don't have the assets anymore to run a PBM? Can you talk about that a little bit and specifically how that would work if you were to try to bring it in-house?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Peter, interesting question. I think it strikes at one of our various options. Just kind of to help p us all recall where we started this journey, we talked a lot about optionality and recognize that we had some choices ahead of us, one bring it in-house, as you've just described, another would be to recast our agreement with ESI, another would be to go to another vendor, et cetera. So we are considering a full range of options.","I think first I need to preface my remarks by underscoring that we've got probably couple of years at minimum before we need to make that call. And, quite frankly, these considerations were actively involved in sort of the various pluses and minuses of each option. So it's really too early for us to comment on specificity.","And I think that to your point about bringing it in-house and recognize it's a complex process to do so. It does have costs associated with it, we recognize that. But again, let me underscore, it's not a decision that is imminent. We have \u2013 call it a journey that we have to administer with respect to our ongoing negotiations with ESI regarding our position that we stated to them clearly and now it's taken the form of a lawsuit. So I direct you to that with respect to specificity around our engagement with them at this stage.","But optionality, again, I want to underscore, we are in the development mode on our choices, but none of those choices do we have to exercise in any way of an imminent nature, and so I'd prefer just to kind of maybe delay a response to some future date when that is more of an imminent necessity for us to deal with.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Can you talk about sort of the expected savings if you were to bring it in-house? What would that look like relative to the $3 billion that you are seeking from Express on a contract renegotiation?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. As I said, I think certainly a lot of analytics will go into discerning savings. We haven't actually gone into the depths of administratively how you'd build it and the costs associated with building it that then translates to savings. Again, let me restate emphatically that it's too early for us to weigh in on that. And at some future moment in time where it is appropriate, we'll certainly bring that to your attention. It's just too early now to give you clear line of sight on savings or an option of that nature.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to Medicaid. The first part of the question would be, was the higher MLR in Medicaid a function of just the lower rates that you have anticipated or were there other factors like flu perhaps or population mix acuity of the mix or even rising trend in Medicaid that impacted MLR there?","And then second part would be, as we look to the second quarter and the start of Iowa, some of your peers, at least one, I think had established reserves in 2015 in anticipation of pretty significant pressure from Iowa. How should we think about the progression of Medicaid margin into 2Q and the rest of year for Iowa? Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Dave, good morning. Let me first start with Medicaid. Yes, a significant portion of what you saw in the MLR is a function of what we've been talking around the rate pressure and those rates coming down. I think our outlook for the year from the Medicaid team continues to be consistent with the outlook that we gave when we gave guidance initially and we expect to be at our MLR in trends planning within the levels that we have fully expected within the book. So, no real surprises there.","Relative to Iowa, as you know, we did not book a PDR. We typically expect to have a higher MLR and to lose money early on when a program is rolled out. And then ultimately the PDR requires you to look over the life of the contract. And we clearly expect to be a profitability over the life of the contract, which is why we don't have a PDR booked on it. But because the contract was delayed, obviously the MLR will reflect that 9 months of activity instead of 10 months, which means that your MLR will be a little bit pressured in the current year but only by an additional month. The fact that it was delayed by a month will create a little bit of pressure this year, but obviously we expect that to come down next year.","But while we weren't necessarily pleased with membership being delayed and the revenue impact, we actually think that additional month probably played well for the industry in terms of getting its contracts finalized and its networks finalized in a manner that hopefully can make this a very strong profitable book, consistent with our historical margins. So we remain optimistic on the program.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Very good. Thanks for that.","Operator","And our next question will come from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to dig into guidance a little bit. You beat consensus expectations for Q1 pretty nicely, particularly on the G&A side, but you didn't raise guidance for the year. In fact, you took your G&A number up and kept your MLR stable even though you seem to be talking about pressure on the MLR on the Individual side at least from a mix perspective. Can you talk a little bit about why the puts and takes ended up the way that they were and why we didn't see upward pressure on MLR and downward pressure on G&A?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Let me address a few things. One is, I want to highlight again that if we look purely at Q1 and the results, it would have implied that we should have had a raise, which I think is a very valid question that you're asking. I can't emphasize enough that we are very pleased with all the metrics in Q1, but with those metrics we really thought it was best to maintain a lot of conservatism that we could have otherwise potentially released in Q1 until we see how this book evolves into Q2. I think it's fair to say that the industry last year, and ourselves included, got to see a lot more of how things developed as last year progressed. So we're just taking a much more conservative posture until we see more development.","The second thing I would highlight again is we did highlight that we are covering another $0.03 of assessments from Co-ops and maintaining that guidance as well.","And then the last thing I would say is that in terms of the metrics, we like our G&A where it's at. And we think with this additional membership, this is the G&A leverage we should have gotten a year ago with exchanges. As you know, it was deleverage impact to us a year ago. This year it's going to be a leverageable impact. And so, we're holding the line on G&A. And, again, if the membership plays out with the risk profile we would expect then that G&A leverage helps to improve the margins. If it doesn't then the G&A leverage helps to offset any surprises. So I'd love to give you a different answer but, I mean, the reality is we just chose to be conservative in Q1 until we can see how this book of business evolves.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, as you mentioned on the Small Group business that you saw some pressure particularly in the states that expanded the 51 to 100, what percent of your Small Group business is in those states?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's actually a decent amount and I would say it was primarily in California. As you know, California was one of those states that made the decision as did New York and Colorado. So, if you're looking at, what I would call your typical market that would be the most significant for us it's California of that group. And as a result, not only did your historical Small Group products no longer be allowed to persist but you actually had to reintroduce all new products and reconsider the product mix of what it would look like if they went to different thresholds for what was defined as Small Group. So we're not happy about the membership we lost in those markets but we also recognize that not every state adopted the flexibility that was offered them under the Affordable Care Act.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Do you think that that's the more states are going to end up doing that, it is a headwind we'd expect to see next year in more states or if you were going to do it you would have done it by now?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think if you were going to do it, you would've done it by now. The other states have actually gone and maintained the historical Small Group definition. So I think that's behind us now.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the exchanges. I guess, last quarter, you had mentioned that the exchange book was breakeven for 2015. And as you've talked about it, you expected to pull G&A and bring it back to sort of profitable levels. Obviously, you've done better on the enrollment side. So, I guess, you've talked about your conservatism. Can you help us in terms of what margins are assumed at this point for the exchange or maybe what's embedded in guidance for 2016?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Ralph. Yeah, in essence, I will tell you, as we said before, our targeted margin is a 3% to 5%. When we built our plan for this year, we were targeting lower than that threshold. We have not adjusted that targeted margin. So, my point is that to the extent this membership does have the risk profile we have, you should expect a better margin as a result of the G&A leverage play and to the extent that those 3Rs, in fact, not only settle up as we've been notified to date between Wakely and CMS but actually cash flowed as well between the parties that have to settle up then you could expect margin expansion as well.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So, I guess, I just want to go back to the disconnect to the lack of guidance raise. If the assumption is to make still, let's call it, 1% to 2% margin or whatever that number is, on the exchange on a bigger book, may be to help level set, can you give a sense at all what you booked for 1Q in terms of sort of a comparable margin on the exchange?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","As you know, historically when you have an individual member you're very profitable in Q1 and that profitability then declines down to ultimately a loss in Q4. What I would say is that from our perspective, we've chosen not to take that profitability in in Q1 but rather book to a breakeven perspective and then see how this book evolves in Q2 and thereafter. So to the extent that it evolves positively then you'll get the margin improvement both from Q1 as well as in the run rate for the year.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then I think it was asked earlier but I don't think we got to sort of the answer around how you're positioning for 2017. Are there new states or territory that you're going to want to enter? And maybe a sense, I know it's early at this point but when we think about target margins you talked about 3% to 5%, is 2017 sort of an area where you expect to get there, get closer to there. Any just general commentary around that would be helpful. Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We are not targeting on a standalone basis any new markets outside of our 14 states. I think our goal is to continue to stabilize the market in those states and start trending towards our targeted 3% to 5% margin.","I would not anticipate at this point in time that in 2017 we would necessarily achieve that level of margin but nonetheless there's been a lot of activity around the regulations and ways to improve and create more stability, so we'll see. And to be fair, it's a little bit early in the pricing cycle so we ultimately need to see how pricing evolves and what the states ultimately approved in the pricing cycle on whether or not we can get there as early as 2017. But right now, I'd be more cautious on getting there in 2017 and view it more as a 2018 play.","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the question is interesting the way you put it about expanding to other states. I mean, obviously, I'm going to be blunt, we precluded, Blue Cross Blue Shield presence in our 14 states and I really think we should underscore the value we bring to our markets is our brand legacy, incredibly well known with respect to quality as well as affordability. And to Wayne's earlier point, we have witnessed, we really do believe this flight to safety is real and I think flight to safety is very relevant with respect to how folks are connecting back to us in terms of a known brand. I think we're going to really seek to leverage that more effectively in every market that we're serving.","And the last point I'll make I think is very important to underscore is that Cigna will help us with future expansion beyond our 14 states, so that's a story that's not yet told. And when it becomes clear that we can, we will express ourselves probably in more depth in terms of the potential to expand to other markets relative to the public exchanges.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thanks. Helpful.","Operator","And our next question will come from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning, guys. Apologize if I missed this, but did you guys say what you're now assuming for the reinsurance, co-insurance rate? I know at 4Q, you said a little above 50%. There's some data from CMS which suggests it could be more like 60% to 65%. Just want to get a sense for what you're assuming now and whether that's had an impact on guidance? Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Chris. Thanks for the question. So we continue to assume a little north of 50%. I would tell you that if the CMS data of 60% to 65% goes forward, we will have sizable upside relative to those percentages. We're not so sure it will evolve ultimately to that level. But based on the most recent data that's been submitted, as well as the Wakely data we received on this, we are at a number below what the data would imply is what I would say, and should have some conservatism going into 2Q and beyond. But again, we want to see ultimate settlement. As a reminder, on risk corridors, we continue to maintain 100% valuation allowance against any receivables.","And I would tell you the more sizable upside ultimately will be on the risk adjusters if what we've seen in early data related to 2015 and 2016 is in fact holds truth into 2Q, and again, if it in fact gets monetized by the parties that owe it. So, I would say all three areas represent potential upside. The corridor being the least, though, because we just don't see the money in the kitty to fund those.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Good morning. I was hoping that you could give us your assessment on the Group Commercial side. The decline of, I think, it was 245,000 lives in the quarter was in line with what you guided to. I know you referred to some states where they expanded the definition of Small Group and that was a factor. I assume that there's some ASO conversions. Does some of that also reflect a conservative pricing posture? I mean, I know you always try to be conservative but have you needed to be more conservative in the current pricing environment? If you could just talk to that.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Matt. Yeah, let me first start by saying, well, it has some conversions from fully insured to ASO. And I think clearly, you can see that in how strong our ASO book has gone and not just in National but in the Large Group business as well. I think it's fair to say that at least half of it though represents those markets that did the switch, with the majority of that being in California. And I would say we've maintained our pricing discipline in California.","And it seems that most of that membership went to a single carrier, primarily a not-for-profit carrier that we think priced fairly aggressively. And again, from our perspective, we'll weather that storm as we have in the past and hopefully win those members back in the next year or so. But that I'd say it's about 50\/50 split. And then of the 50% that's really left, it's primarily California.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. That's very helpful. And also, if I could ask, what is approximately the amount by which you need to increase price going into 2017 to reflect the lack of reinsurance? And how much of a problem is that going to be for exacerbating some adverse selection that's already a program-wide problem to some degree in the exchanges?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You know, Matt, while we generally haven't given all the specifics in pricing, I think, the reinsurance is one mathematically people can generally back into a range in the 5% to 6% range of what it could impact on upward pricing by itself. And so, I would say that that 5% to 6% range that we've had others ask about is a reasonable proxy of what you should expect for the piece of reinsurance that would run off.","Relative to all other pricing, we're not necessarily talking to specifics. We're just in the process now of filing with our states. But this is clearly one area we're spending time making sure everybody is educated on. And I would tell you insurance regulators understand it. They get it. And they understand the implications of it. And so, for competitive reasons, I would like to probably not discuss any further though our rate filings or actions at this point.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Again, following up on the Commercial book but now taking a view into 2017, you had a 2% gain in your Commercial Businesses. I know it's a mishmash of various things, but as you are looking into 2017...","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Ana, can you start your question over? We're having trouble hearing you.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","I was asking about the trend. Is this better?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry. You are cutting in and out. It's very difficult to hear you.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Better now?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","A little bit, yes. Please try again.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Okay. I was asking about the 2017 Commercial outlook and whether or not, as you look into 2017, we're likely to see a better operating gain growth rate because the not-for-profit Blues, Aetna, everywhere they're all losing money on exchanges. And I know you don't overlap directly with the Blues, but as you think about Cigna and the post-Cigna world, if the pricing and underwriting spread will get better into 2017?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I would say, while we haven't given 2017 outlook yet and as you can imagine, I would first want to see how 2016 develops. But what I would highlight is that we would expect to see the margins begin to trend to the more sustainable levels of 3% to 5%. I don't think, again, we'll be there by 2017. But ultimately it seems that the environment is starting to recognize the true cost of operating the exchanges and the membership that resides with it.","These are large risk pools. So, I think the industry is getting to the point where they have enough data to support the pricing that belongs with it, and we think our job now is to continue to educate our regulators on the risk profile of the pools, actions we can take to help drive the cost down for affordability, and at the same time, though, to the extent that we are limited on actions, to make sure people understand the pricing that goes with it.","So I think for 2017, today, as best we would say, it would be our expectation that margins would improve and pricing would continue to improve.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Are you talking about exchanges or Commercial? I was talking about the Group business and the spread between trend and pricing. More, sort of, is it likely to be a silver lining on the cloud just because other companies are losing money on exchanges so they become more conservative on the Commercial pricing?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's hard to know what others may do in their pricing. Clearly, in California, we did not see a player who we know lost money on exchanges necessarily take a more rationale pricing on their Small Group book. So, I guess, what I would say is when you see in one market and then one competitor you see in one market and one competitor, so it's hard for us to understand. I think I would say this is \u2013 our philosophy is we've got to cover cost of capital. We've got to give our shareholders a fair return for the risk that we bear and we price accordingly and then we'll just have to weather the markets whatever they bring in the short term as we did on the public exchanges, the last couple of years.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","And then, finally, on the 51 to 100, once you get past that headwind, is there a reduced tendency towards dumping from employers because exchanges haven't been as stable and there's a lot of volatility there?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We think there is. It seems like the dumping factor has really moved down and I think this was kind of the last clarification of product description and size under ACA that had to be implemented. So I think from our perspective, we view it as kind of stability and, I would say, internally, we are targeting actually trying to get back to Small Group growth again now.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","and we'll go to the last question. It will come from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. I just had a question on cost trends overall. I'm just interested within the guidance range that you talked about, how trend may be behaving within that range in the first quarter. United had talked about seeing a bit of an uplift in cost trend in the first quarter, maybe around 50 basis points. And then, also just specifically whether you have been seeing an increase in surgical volumes year-over-year in the first quarter relative to last year?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Scott, thanks for the question. First of all, it's important to recognize that we had assumed that trends would move up this year, as you know, what we finished last year versus what we guided to this year. So trends have moved up but within our expectations and our pricing. As we look at various factors I think we would've said early on that trend might've been favorably impacted by the flu, but the fact that the late season happened, ultimately we think for the full year that that won't have a positive upside to us nor downside. We think flu is going to play probably within our expectations.","We did expect a fairly sizable uptick in trend in Q1 regarding Hep C and we saw that, which is good. And the good news is, at least on our rolling three-month average that we've looked at, it seems to be playing right in line with our expectation, slightly better than our expectations. But I would tell you that we are not going to bank that yet because we think there may be some warehousing because there is new genotype drugs that are coming out that people may be holding off on until those are available.","So, I think, ultimately when I look at what could be the big surprise items, like a Hep C or a flu or other item, everything seems to be playing pretty well relative to our expectations and while we did expect it to be high in the quarter, it was but within our pricing.","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Scott, this is Joe. I think probably it's fair to also comment on a lot of what you can't see regarding the internal activity of the company where we're obviously vigilant regarding trend changes. Internally we're building really robust provider collaboration models really driven toward value-based contracting that then tries to ameliorate the risk of trend escalation.","Our data analytics infrastructure has been a remarkable uplift to the company with respect to our investments and the resultant insights that we've captured in order to better manage the cost of care. So there is kind of the macro level that you see, but the micro level within the company, it's amazing how well we've positioned ourselves to really address the kind of prevailing winds that come at us in and around trend changes.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And then just on the surgical vols, are you able to tease out whether what you saw year-over-year there, or is it still a little bit too early to tell?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a little early. I mean, we obviously look for different areas that might spike. I mean, we see little bit more there, but again relative to expectations, I think, things are playing okay. So nothing of any specificity that I can provide at this point.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Let me just kind of express the thanks to all of you for your questions.","In summary, I'm pleased with our first quarter results and believe that these results position us very well for the remainder of the year. Hopefully, you got a sense of that with respect to our commentaries today. We do remain committed to increasing access to high-quality affordable healthcare. Specifically, we believe our ability to serve our customers will be advanced by the pending acquisition of Cigna, which we still remain of the belief that it is expected to close in the second half of 2016. And also, this concludes our continued focus on improving matters like drug pricing.","I also want to thank all of our associates for their continued commitment to serving our nearly 40 million members.

Joe and Wayne are then both available for Q&A.","During the call we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com.","We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. As this marks our third conference call in roughly a month, we're going to keep it as succinct as possible and then move right into Q&A. We're pleased to announce strong second quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $3.10 with solid membership and margin trends.","On a GAAP basis earnings per share was $3.13. Our adjusted earnings per share increased from the second quarter of 2014 driven by revenue growth and improved medical loss ratio and opportunistic capital deployment. We ended the second quarter of 2015 with over 38.5 million members, over 1 million members more than the 37.5 million members we reported at the end of 2014.","Our growth continues to be balanced so far in 2015 as we added 571,000 Medicaid members, 331,000 national members, 51,000 individual members and 16,000 local group members. As a reminder, we closed on the Simply Healthcare acquisition in February of this year, which contributed 209,000 members. These results have been supported by strong operating cash flow of $2.8 billion year-to-date, which represents 1.6 times net income.","I'd like to start by discussing our Commercial business. Commercial membership has increased by 398,000 since year-end 2014. Revenues remain relatively flat in the second quarter, but have declined by roughly 6% since the prior-year quarter to $9.4 billion, primarily due to fully insured member declines, including the previously announced decision to discontinue our employer group Medicare offering in the state of Georgia account.","Self-funded membership trends have been encouraging, increasing by 710,000 versus year-end 2014. This was primarily driven by better than expected growth in our large group business. Large group and small group insured membership in the Commercial business remained relatively flat in the quarter as expected. Small group ended the quarter with a total membership of 1.35 million.","Individual membership declined by 51,000 during the quarter as we continue to see contraction in our legacy non-metal products and metal products off of the public exchanges. Our exchange membership declined by 5,000 lives to 893,000 members, which was due to normal attrition outside of open enrollment and was slightly better than expectations.","We have a solid pipeline for national accounts and expect solid growth in this area in 2016, with several large new accounts already closed representing several hundred thousand lives. For the 3Rs we were able to incorporate the data received by CMS in late June in our second quarter financials. All in, our current read is that the data received was relatively in line with our expectations.","We did see some benefit from a higher than accrued reinsurance receivable, but that was offset by higher than expected risk adjuster payable. Risk corridor and MLR rebate estimates were then refined. It is important to note that we may need to adjust our estimates for both the 2014 and 2015 benefit years as the data we have received is subject to appeal.","So to summarize our current position, we've updated our reinsurance accrual as appropriate. We increased the net payable position for risk adjusters for both the 2014 and 2015 benefit years during the quarter. As a result of the increase, we reduced our risk quarter expectation from 2014 and are now in a net neutral position for the 2014 and 2015 benefit years. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information.","I'd like to now turn to the Government segment and speak to the solid second quarter results. Our Government business segment had another strong quarter, adding 147,000 members driven by strong organic growth in Medicaid. Revenues in the quarter were $10.4 billion, up approximately 25.7% versus the prior-year quarter.","Government business year-to-date membership growth has exceeded our expectation. We've grown by approximately 630,000 members, including 571,000 in Medicaid, 31,000 in our federal employee program, and 28,000 in Medicare. Please note that these results include membership associated with Simply Healthcare.","The pipeline of opportunity for our Government business remains substantial. We continue to expect $65 billion of new business to be awarded by the end of 2018, split about evenly between traditional Medicaid and new populations in specialized services. We believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising healthcare costs and improving quality for their residents.","We are pleased to have announced during the quarter that we were awarded the opportunity to geographically expand our offering of Medicaid services for the state of Kentucky. Government operating margins improved 210 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 5.9%. This primarily reflected improved medical cost performance in certain markets in the Medicaid and Medicare business and expected retro rate adjustments recorded during the quarter for certain Medicaid contracts.","I now want to turn the call over to Wayne to discuss the key consolidated financial highlights for the second quarter of 2015. He will also provide updated commentary on our 2015 outlook.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Joe, and good morning. As Joe stated, in the second quarter we reported earnings per share of $3.13 on a GAAP basis and $3.10 per share on an adjusted basis. Medical enrollment has increased by over one million members or 2.7% during the year to approximately 38.5 million medical members as of June 30. This reflected membership increases in virtually all lines of business.","Operating revenue was nearly $19.8 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $1.5 billion or 8.4% versus the second quarter of 2014, reflecting robust enrollment in the Government business, additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends, and new fees associated with healthcare reform as well as growth in administrative fees as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends.","This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses, including the previously announced decision to discontinue our employer group Medicare offering in the state of Georgia account. The growing diversity of our business aligns with our long-term strategy, as we believe we are well positioned to continue capitalizing on future growth opportunities.","The benefit expense ratio was 82.1% in the second quarter of 2015, a decrease of 60 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The decline reflected a lower medical cost ratio in the Local Group business due to the timing of medical costs experience, improved medical cost performance in the Medicaid and Medicare businesses, and the impact of retro rate adjustments reported during the quarter in the Medicaid business.","Our MLRs improved by 150 basis points year-to-date in 2015 versus year-to-date 2014 on a consolidated basis to 81.2%, with improvements in both business segments contributing to the change. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect underlying local group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% plus or minus 50 basis points.","Our SG&A expense ratio decreased by 40 basis points from the second quarter of 2014 to 15.4% in the second quarter of 2015. The improvement largely reflected our ongoing cost improvement initiatives, the changing mix of our membership toward government business, and lower spending related to the public exchange's open enrollment season. Partially offsetting the decline was higher administrative costs as a result of the strong membership growth in the first six months of 2015.","Our Specialty business has shown strong growth this year as we've added 542,000 total dental members and 398,000 vision members. We are pleased with the improvement in Specialty's performance, which shows that our recent efforts toward driving an increased penetration in our medical book are bearing fruit.","Moving to the balance sheet, days in claims payable was 43 days as of June 30, down 2.7 days from 45.7 days as of March 31, 2015. The expected decrease was primarily due to an acceleration of payments fee during the quarter as the company worked through the normal first quarter peak season of new and renewal memberships. As previously discussed, we expect days in claims payable to come back down closer to 40 over time.","Our debt-to-capital ratio was 41.9% at June 30, 2015, up 260 basis points from 39.3% as to March 31, which includes the impact of our recent equity issue offering and partial 2.75% convertible security repayment in early May. We ended the second quarter with approximately $2.2 billion of cash and investments at the parent company. And our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $688 million as of June 30.","Moving to cash flow, we generated strong operating cash flow of more than $2.8 billion during the first six months of 2015 or 1.6 times net income. During the quarter, operating cash flow was $1.2 billion or 1.4 times net income. Cash flow trends thus far in 2015 have been encouraging and we remain comfortable in our outlook of greater than $3.5 billion for the full year. As a reminder, cash flow in the third quarter is impacted by the payment of the 2015 health and surety and the receipt of the 2014 reinsurance reimbursement from the federal government.","We repurchased 4 million shares during the quarter for approximately $637 million, representing a weighted average price of $157.89. As of June 30, we had approximately 4.3 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, which is intended to be utilized over a multiyear period subject to market conditions.","As a result of the recent agreement to acquire Cigna, we have halted share buybacks for the remainder of 2015. We used $164 million during the quarter for our cash dividend. And yesterday, the audit committee declared our third quarter 2015 dividend of $0.625 per share to shareholders.","Turning to our full year 2015 outlook, we continue to see 2015 as the year of continued growth across our business. We are updating our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook from greater than $9.90 to greater than $10. Our revised outlook is consistent with current analysts' estimates and reflects the strong first half trends. Our outlook includes the impact of halting our share buyback program for the remainder of 2015.","Additionally, our updated revenue outlook now includes the impact of slower than expected growth in the Dual Eligible program. We are pleased with overall results in the first half, which bodes well for the full year 2015. While we do not offer quarterly EPS guidance, as we said last quarter, we expect the fourth quarter to be the lowest quarterly EPS figure for the year as a result of the diminishing impacts of the 3Rs, time to get medical cost experience for our members and changes to our overall business mix.","While we are encouraged by the underlying trends in the first half of 2015, our outlook continues to expect commercial business margin to be lower in the second half of the year versus the 11.6% reported year-to-date which is reflected in our outlook. We continue to expect operating cash flow in 2015 to be greater than $3.5 billion.","With that, operator, please open the queue for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question is from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. I just wanted to go into the items that you had spiked out as helping the MLR in the quarter. I was wondering if you could try and quantify a little bit more exactly how much of the benefit was from the expense timing, how much of the benefit was from the retro Medicaid, and some of the things that you highlighted.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Kevin, good morning. First, let me start with a number of the items that actually occurred including the retro were anticipated in the second quarter, so while we did benefit from it in and of itself, it was not necessarily something that was not expected. And probably more importantly, I would say the MLR in total still came in better than our expectations. So first of all, underlying run rate appears to be strong across the businesses and we continue to be encouraged by it.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, well, you're not prepared to break out just how much they were in the quarter?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, no. These are \u2013 again, I view these as normal run rate expectations with puts and takes that occur every quarter. So no, we wouldn't break those out separately.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, then you mentioned the trend is \u2013 underlying trend is solid. Any additional color you can give there about components of trend or is it the midpoint of the range that you guys are reaffirming or does it only count for the one and\/or the other?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we continue to reaffirm our trend guidance at 7% plus or minus 50 basis points but I would say at this point, Kevin, if the first half were to continue through the second half of the year, we would be in the lower half of that range, this 6.5% to 7% range.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Ah, yes. Good morning. Thank you. If maybe I could ask about the reserve development in the quarter. So the days claims payable came down just shy of three days. And looks like the reserve development for the first half was considerably larger than the rate of reserve to development in the last year. I guess the question here is, it clearly shows conservative reserving and strength in 2014, but at first glance, that looks like your reserve reduction to medical claims liability benefited your earnings in the first half, maybe by significant magnitude. Can you talk to that?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Matt. Thank you so much for the question as well. Let me first state that we do not believe our first half benefited from the additional reserves that came through in the reserve roll-forwards. Specifically as those reserves related to the prior year, the majority of that release actually ended up being re-established as additional liabilities for the risk collars we had in Medicaid, for the MLR rebates in our individual business, and for risk adjusters on our individual business.","So it simply shifted from one bucket of the reserve balance sheet to another bucket of the reserve balance sheet. As those got released there, additional reserves were then established. That was part of our conservative posturing we tried to take at year-end so that as things would develop, we knew there wouldn't be much upside, but we also knew we were protected against the downside.","Probably the best quality metric I can point you to, Matt, to then validate that we did not benefit in the quarter is the cash flow to net income, which will show how strong cash flow is relative to our net income earnings. But we did not benefit in the quarter, and believe we continue to have high-single digit margin for adverse deviation in our reserves.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you for addressing that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey there. I'm getting a huge increase in the government premiums. Is that exclusively the Medicaid true-up or were there any outside or out-of-period revenue adjustments we should think about within Medicare Advantage?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Christine. A little bit was the true-up, but the true-up in and of itself was not that meaningful and so it wasn't the largest driver. I will tell you that our Medicare is performing quite well, and a number of the items that we were fixing in previous years including risk adjusters and other items are no longer impacting our Medicare book of business.","So as we said as part of our turnaround strategy that this should be the first year that we thought investors would begin to see stability, in fact increases in its earnings. And we think that run rate will continue. But I will tell you Medicare was as much a contributor as Medicaid was within the quarter.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","So last year, you had prior-period negative adjustment to the risk adjuster. Can I assume that this quarter there might have been some positive true-ups to risk adjuster past accruals because you had increased your conservatism or how do I think about that? Because that Medicare PMPM has got to be up pretty big too.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, actually, we did not \u2013 I would say we have a conservative balance sheet though regarding the risk adjusters at this point. But I would say that we did get our recent mid-year statement on Medicare Advantage and it's in line with our expectations. I would say relative to risk adjusters for the broader exchange book, we actually had a true-up for the prior year which again, was offset by the excess conservatism on the balance sheet because that's why we had it established. And then we applied a run rate factor for the first half of the year to that as well. So again, we believe our balance sheet continues to maintain a decent amount of conservatism for the unknown.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","I'm sorry. I just need a \u2013 I'm not clear. Was there a positive true-up to the risk adjuster for Medicare Advantage in the quarter? Because then MA, Medicare Advantage premium yield looked like it was up pretty significantly.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, not a meaningful adjustment versus our expectations, I should say, Christine. But clearly we were expecting a much better and positive return from our investments we made in the previous years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tom Carroll from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Tom A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe you could spike out for us a bit more or give some more clarity on the increase in the operating gains seen in the Government business. I mean you're going from $313 million to almost $610 million. How much of that was improved operations, Wayne, as you mentioned versus perhaps retro adjustments in the businesses?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Tom. Good morning. The vast majority of it is improved operations in the Medicare book plus you're getting full run rate benefits from the Medicaid expansion that occurred last year plus our new wins. Remember, a lot of the Medicaid expansion in and of itself did not really get on the books until around June of last year. And so last year's 2Q is really not reflective of not only the full quarter growth but, as you know, that ramped up then through the end of last year plus new wins we had into this year.","So what you really are seeing there is core organic growth in our Medicaid book as well as unique improvement in our Medicare book. And I do want to reiterate the retro adjustment is quite de minimis relative to the quarter but just one of many things that we have happening every quarter.","Tom A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, Wayne.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Just a quick clarification on the guidance. Stopping the buybacks, Wayne, what was the impact on adjusted EPS in terms of the guidance?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Matt. It was not overly significant. You're looking at around $0.04 to $0.05 total is what the impact is based on the timing that we had assumed we would have.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then next question just sticking with that Government segment margin, you guys put up a 5.9% margin this quarter. I know it's just under 5% for the full year, or year-to-date I should say. So what's running \u2013 I mean I just, I think about the Medicaid businesses on a pre-tax basis and none of the competitors are anywhere close to that 6%. Medicare historically, at least Medicare Advantage has not been that high and I know your business has not performed to that level in the past.","So what's causing that margin, that sort of 6%? And how do we think about, you've talked about this turnaround from 2014, are we fully there or is there actually an opportunity for even higher margin?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Josh. Good question. So a couple of things to keep in mind regarding how the margins look in the quarter and then where we think they'll pan out. And I think it's fair to say that on the Medicaid front, the margins are quite strong in the quarter, but when you're comparing it to the previous-year quarter but recognize again, with the ramp up that occurred last year there was heavy G&A for that initial ramp up, so as we're staffing and resourcing in the quarter a year-ago for all that ramp up coming in, you're getting a fairly sizable G&A hit to the margins but you're not necessarily getting the revenue bump that comes with it or the earnings that are associated with it. So as you compare to this year you're getting what I'll call much more normalized view of what margins could look like.","The second thing I would highlight is our Medicare book has improved meaningfully. This was one of our strategies. We've done the things we've wanted to do around pairing the business back, refocusing on HMO products and slowly starting to improve our risk adjusters, and so I would tell you on a year-over-year basis the margins in Medicare specifically are quite strong.","And then finally I would say that we had assumed some duals though still to continue to grow through the back half of the year, and as you know the duals will have a very muted effect, somewhat a negative margin in the early rollout. So that's another reason why I think you'll see the margin start to come down through the back half of the year but in general, Matt, we're very encouraged by how the whole book is running.","I would also highlight that we still see margin opportunity for improvements, Josh, in a number of our areas that we have right now around certain states including Florida, Kansas and others where we continue to believe that they're large states that have upside still.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I guess, Wayne, my question was more around that 6% margin or even 5% on a year-to-date basis, just kind of absolute, not \u2013 forget about relative to where you've been but just on an absolute level do you think 5% margins in your Government segment can get better, right? And so is Medicaid actually running at 5% pre-tax margins?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think that is probably more the high end of the range of where we're going to be on a sustainable basis. I wouldn't necessarily look at that to be higher than that level.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","A.J., are you there?","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Hello, everybody. Sorry about that. Can you hear me?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, A.J.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","First off, on the medical loss ratio, if I look at where you're at year-to-date across the board and then look at where you've maintained guidance so what that would imply about the back half of the year, a significant step up overall. Can you just give us a little flavor on what some of the drivers of that would be? Obviously seasonality to some degree, maybe mix shift back half versus first half, just general conservatism as you look in the back half of the year, maybe some color on that.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, A.J. Good morning. Let me start with one of the things that I would point each of you too is to actually look at the margin that the Commercial segment has reported through the first half of this year being around 11.6%. We believe that the seasonality patterns are very different that what we've seen historically and part of this is due to the ACA and how it's rolling out.","We believe we'll get to what I'll call our typical sustainable high single digit margin, but if you take that 11.6% for the first half and then consider what it would take to bring that down the high single digit margin, to give you a little bit of a flavor in the Commercial book of the seasonality that we believe we're seeing along with the mix.","I would also highlight that you start getting diminishing returns on margins in the back half of the year now because of the way the 3Rs have been established and the way the MLR rebates work. So as you have outperformance profitability early on, as that continues, you end up essentially recording collars under the Medicaid and then, of course, MLR rebates and risk adjusters and corridors under the exchange-related business.","So it's not that the business will be performing worse in the second half. We actually think the business is doing quite well, but we think the seasonality and mix patterns have changed meaningfully from what we've seen historically.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then just as my follow-up, I was going to ask about your updated thoughts on the 3Rs. Obviously, we've gotten two of the 3Rs data actually in hand on that. Can you comment on whether you learned anything from that that's impacting the way you're thinking about them for this year, and then second, have you got any early information on the risk corridors and where they're coming out or any thoughts on that?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So let me start, A.J., on the reinsurance corridor. No big surprises there from our perspective. A little bit of upside to it because we had put some reserves up against some of that, but nothing of what I'll call a meaningful nature and not much of a run rate impact for the current year.","On the risk adjusters, though, we did have a net payable true-up, as high a reserve as we had booked on the risk adjusters. But it's part of the reason we maintain the excess reserves within our roll forward and our balance sheet, because we knew there could be some unknowns and that was some of the protection that we were trying to build against.","So the good news is that we reserved in total for it so it didn't have a net negative impact to our bottom line. And then we took that updated adjuster view and then ran rate that for the full year and then booked six-twelfths of that as of June 30. So that is reflected in our outlook as well, what I would call the most current view, as conservative as we can be on it. So we do have that reflected.","And then relative to risk corridors, we're pretty much in a net neutral position, not much of a receivable, not much of a payable. It's more of a mathematical calculation and so we're not really expecting any surprises on the last R from our perspective.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Sure. Good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Windley. Some of question's to A.J.'s except on the SG&A and talking about the seasonality and ramp, and I guess as you're thinking about duals coming on, I guess I would have thought that might have created a little bit more leverage than in prior years. So, again, it seems like the guidance there might be biased, having some conservatism. Can you walk us through sort of the bridge from the first half to second half and why maybe SG&A shouldn't lay at the lower end of the range?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","One thing to keep in mind on the duals is that they're actually very heavy on the SG&A during the initial rollout phase, and that the leverage actually comes in more in years two and three than it does in year one. So I think one thing to keep in mind is in the programs that are starting to expand in the second half, when you look at Texas and some of the other pilot programs still ramping up in California. So it actually has the opposite dynamic of what you're describing in the first year of rollout. And then you start to get your leverage more effectively in the later periods of time, and primarily because you continue to ramp up and provide a lot more medical care as you're trying to get these people involved in what I'll call your sustainable programs around medical cost management.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Got it. I thought there was just a load ahead of that until the revenue started. But I understand what you're saying. And then two quick housekeeping items. On the Florida Medicaid rates, what are you guys expecting on the booking guidance there? And what are your thoughts sort of on how the state's shaking out? And then on taxes, you guys are running about 150 to 200 basis points below your original guidance. Have you done something there to improve the tax profile or is there just some unusual items that are going to shake out where taxes ramp back up in the latter half of the year?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So let me start with the Florida rates. Our guidance reflects what we know the rates are as they're currently being put forward. With that said though, I would indicate that we still believe the rate environment is somewhat challenging in Florida. We would like to see the rate continue to be improved. And we continue to work with our partners in the state around the product designs we have and the geographies. And that's why I indicated we believe we have opportunity for margin improvement in the state still.","But again, the initial rates that were put forward were slightly behind what we thought were the rates that were needed, but not meaningfully, which is encouraging. And then I would say that our outlook reflects those rates, at least as they've been put forward at this point in time.","Regarding taxes, it's important just to remember that the health insurer fee is a fixed fee. And so it doesn't ebb and flow based on your current year revenues or membership. And so as we have better income performance, and in this case where we are having strong operating gain performance and strong net income performance, it actually creates a leverage on your tax rate. And so in essence, what you're seeing in the lower rate is really a function of better operating earnings.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Rigg from Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.","Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. I just wanted to get some more color as to what you guys are seeing with regard to the duals. And I'm not sure I knew where you started the year in terms of projections enrollment for that group of people in revenue and things. Just trying to figure out how that impacted the $500 million reduction. Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Chris, good morning. The majority of the reduction is related to the dual space and then specifically in Texas as we looked at the outlook. A couple just reminders, we had three counties in California, Santa Clara, Alameda and L.A. that we were selected in to be part of the demo pilot. Relative to that, Alameda actually ended up withdrawing the pilot so that did impact I would say our full-year outlook from a revenue perspective as we had fully anticipated that pilot would continue.","L.A. County went live last year but the membership continues to be a slow uptake at this point. And I would say that phenomenon we saw in California which started last year is really continuing as we get into this year. We're seeing in Virginia the enrollment is slower as well as New York. I do want to remind you that we had a fairly, I thought, conservative outlook for duals revenue over our five-year outlook period. So we had anticipated really only around $2.5 billion of duals revenue by 2018.","And based on the current ramp up and the pace that it's going on the pilot programs, we're running closer to about $1.4 billion at this point in time. So we still have a number of years to close that gap, but I would say in general the duals continue to come on much slower than we even we had modeled at this point in time. But the majority of the revenue decline is solely related to the duals uptake being slower than we anticipated.","Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Getting back to the risk adjusters and changes you made relative to the government data that came out, can you quantify the impact of that charge that you took to earnings this year for 2014 for the risk adjustment changes, as well as quantify the amount that you changed your 2015 guidance for? Because you said you had updated that. Can you gauge what the impact was in the quarter of just the risk adjusters? And I understand from what you're saying that you sort of offset that with the reserve drawdowns. Is that the way to think about the reserve drawdowns as well?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. First of all, let me start by saying that what we used in establishing risk adjusters was the Wakely data. It was the best information we had and we continue to use that data. We had concerns though, regarding the Wakely data because we knew a number of competitors had not reported their data. And so we booked our risk adjusters at 12\/13\/2014 relative to Wakely and then we established additional reserves on our balance sheet for what we thought a range of outcomes could be, and tried to maintain a conservative range for that. And that's what you see running through the reserve roll-forward under DCP.","So as we got to this year, and you can look at the public data that was available, but the number was north of $50 million that we were short on the risk adjuster. But at the same time, the number that we have within our balance sheet was more than adequate to cover that because we had assumed that it would be potentially short from what Wakely had posted.","So ultimately, our current year earnings to date did not have a detriment to them because of risk adjusters, nor did they have a benefit. And of course, at that point then we could release any additional reserves that we thought we needed related to prior year, which we did. However, those reserves then resulted in collars for Medicaid being paid back to the states as well as risk corridor payables that would be adjusted from there as well as MLR rebate payables.","So you have to almost look at the math in a chronological order. So, ultimately, no real benefit to the year, no real detriment to the prior year because we were obviously fully reserved it. And from a run rate perspective, we trued up for that delta. And so you can kind of use that as a gauge of that shortcoming of what we thought it would impact the current year.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So is $50 million the number that I should use to be thinking about moving from the reserves in one area to the reserves for the other areas, or...","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it's a reasonable proxy. I mean, it's less than $100 million, more than $50 million is what I would say at this point. But, again, I think to try to pinpoint one number down is really not the way I would recommend looking at it because you have to consider that our reserving was done with a lot of unknowns, and you have to evaluate kind of all reserves we had on the balance sheet.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Sure. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Pete.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. So the first question is I just wanted to understand better when you look at the mix shifts between your fully-insured, individual and self-insured groups, you're obviously growing in self-insured, losing membership in fully-insured, haven't been doing as well on the individual market. Are you retaining all that within your own book? Are you losing it to players like Cigna or even Anthem \u2013 I'm sorry, Aetna or United.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say the vast majority of what we're retaining within our own book, it's back to our long-term strategy that we built which was to have the biggest catcher's mitt so that we were indifferent to where the customer wanted to play but rather be in a situation we could have a product offering to them. And I think that's reflected obviously in our overall growth in the first six months of 1 million new customers.","So you think about it, we're clearly retaining the vast majority of that between our business lines and then adding to that as well. I would add the national account selling season is starting to draw to a close. We have a small handful of accounts that we're still waiting to hear from that we're optimistic about but we continue to believe we'll be a net grower next year in the several hundreds of thousands range.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","That's helpful, Wayne, thanks. On the $800 million to $400 million, then, this to your point around, where are you in that trajectory? And as you're looking into 2016 with the extension of small group to 100 and potential mix shift to self-insured and individual, how are you pricing for your other exchange book and across the board? And is that likely to go down in a \u2013 is that even bigger headwind in 2016?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The headwind continues to occur in this year at a meaningful clip. What I would tell you, though, is similar to this catcher's mitt scenario we keep describing, we did not see as much small group attrit this year into the public exchange as we thought. So small group is still down year-over-year on operating earnings as we had expected, but not down as much as we had expected so some of the underperformance on the membership and individual is being offset by over-performance on the membership in small group while the EBITDA in small group.","So it will continue to add to the headwind for next year, but I would remind you that the headwind next year becomes the lowest headwind of our three-year period and really starts to become very, very manageable beginning in 2016 and beyond.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Very helpful. Thanks, Wayne.","Operator","Thanks you, and our next question is from Andy Singer from Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. So just following up on those comments you made on the wins in the national account selling season. Any additional color maybe you could talk about and what's driving that success in this self-insured market? Are the wins you're really benefiting from reliance on the Blue Card, or are these primarily wins within your Blue States? Any color there would be appreciated. Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So the vast majority of the wins are directly associated with our direct bidding in our states and the value benefit that our national accounts continue to bring. Now obviously, the Blue Card is an instrumental part of that value proposition because we can offer a significant discount to those ASO members. As you know, large national accounts are very sophisticated buyers. It's a highly competitive market within the ASO segment, and we're able to show not only the benefits of the discounts, but those benefits pass on 100% to the ASO customers. So our value prop is simple, and it's resonating.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. Maybe just following up on some of your comments earlier on the better performance Medicare. I know you touched on some of the drivers there, but can you really just discuss a little bit more detail the changes you guys have made to the Medicare offering that's really driving that performance and any updates related to your bidding strategy for 2016 that you think will continue that trend? Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So let me start with some of the things that we did. One was, we clearly spent more time and energy ensuring that we got from a best-in-class from a risk-coding perspective. I would call those soups and nuts, nothing crazy, just coding better and really bringing a medical management team in that really understood what to do around coding and making sure that we were looking at the charts.","The second thing that we did that's helping us is that we really are medically managing this book of business much better than we believe we have in the past. I think a combination of our historical medical management processes but combining our Medicaid book with our Medicare book and the overall leadership and management has helped meaningfully.","And the last thing I want to highlight is one of the things Joe did when he came here was said, it's hard to manage your business when you're on multiple Medicare platforms. And so last year was the last year of consolidating our Medicare platforms onto a single platforming system. That's done a couple of things. One, it's given us platform expansion because the G&A costs associated with that now are behind us. And two is it's giving us better data analytics and more real-time data to respond than we've had historically. And I would say none of those are sexy or unique, kind of nuts and bolts of running a business.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Sarah James from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Your $65 billion estimate for the Medicaid opportunity through 2018 is at the high end of what peers have been discussing, and I was hoping that you could give us a little bit more clarity on whether or not that includes incremental duals contracts within that 2018 timeframe.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So Sarah, to give you some flavor for it and I can't really speak to our competitors but I can speak to how we plan to participate because we actually participate in a number of markets but if you look at the RFP pipeline that's out there, you've got about $33 billion of what I'll call core Medicaid either re-procurements or new expansion programs, obviously like you've seen in Iowa, et cetera.","When you look at long-term services care and ABD, you've got about $13 billion that's out there. And we've got to look at states like Georgia and Louisiana and North Carolina, et cetera. There is a duals demo opportunity out there and that number's closer to about $7 billion. Now, whether or not that occurs based on the slow pace, we'll see.","But there's a lot of other areas, and I don't want to touch on them all, but intellectual and development disability, complex children in foster care, behavioral health integration, et cetera. So we've got line of sight I would say on each one of these by market, and feel very confident in our $65 billion pipeline number.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","And that $7 billion of duals opportunity, what state would that be in?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're looking more to Ohio and Oklahoma as opportunities there.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll move to the line of Brian Wright from Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.","Brian Michael Wright - CRT Capital Group LLC","Good morning. Sorry about that. My questions have been answered.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you.

This is Joe again. Wayne did a great job. Thank you, Wayne, for that update for everyone. I'd like to thank all of you for your questions. We're pleased with our performance of the company in the second quarter as you can tell, and for the entire first half of 2015.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management.","Doug Simpson - Anthem, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to Anthem's second quarter 2017 earnings call. This is Doug Simpson and with us this morning are Joe Swedish, Chairman, President and CEO; and John Gallina, our CFO.","Joe will provide some high-level commentary on our second quarter financial results, discuss our business unit performance, and then provide some high-level commentary on our updated 2017 financial outlook. John will then discuss our key financial metric performance during the quarter and provide some additional details on our updated 2017 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict, and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release, and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. We're pleased to announce strong second quarter 2017 GAAP earnings per share of $3.16 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.37 with both membership and revenue tracking well. Our second quarter financial results show that we are continuing to carry forward the strong momentum we built coming into the year and during the first quarter. Our membership growth coupled with the strong quality of earnings so far in 2017 gives us confidence that the value proposition we bring to the marketplace is resonating well.","Within membership, both fully insured and self-funded enrollment continue to track well versus our expectation, as we ended the quarter with nearly 40.4 million members. In the first six months of 2017, our membership has grown by 468,000 lives. We're particularly pleased with the membership trends in our commercial insured business, as both Large and Small Group membership came in ahead of expectations again during the quarter.","Our membership results on a consolidated basis translated into second quarter operating revenues of $22.2 billion, an increase of $924 million or 4.3% versus the second quarter of 2016. During the quarter, our Individual enrollment declined by 107,000 lives which was expected. Our total Individual enrollment of approximately 1.8 million members consists of 1.5 million ACA-compliant members and 300,000 non-ACA-compliant members. Of the 1.5 million ACA-compliant members, approximately 1 million or less than 2.5% of our total enrollment were from the individual exchanges. Self-funded enrollment in Local Group and National Accounts were in line with expectations.","Before I discuss the details of our business unit performance, I want to spend a few moments on the evolving policy landscape. As a company, we recognize that access to affordable and high quality healthcare is immensely important and intensely personal for all American. Anthem has always been committed to our members and sought to provide value and limit disruption, no matter their financial circumstances or health status. Our commitment to all of our members, including the most vulnerable populations, has not changed and will not change in the face of what we believe will be an ongoing period of debate and policy and regulatory adjustments in healthcare.","State and federal regulatory and legislative changes will likely impact our Individual and Medicaid businesses and we remain focused on informing government leaders as they develop policy to achieve the common goal of creating stable and affordable marketplaces. For example, insuring appropriate funding for all whom we serve, a balanced risk pool, effective rules and regulations that limit expensive abuses prevalent in today's marketplace, elimination of unnecessary taxes that add to the cost of insurance. Altogether, Anthem will continue to contribute in an ongoing discussion in Washington and the states on behalf of our members and all American, as we work towards stability and sustainability by providing ideas built on experience, data, and member feedback.","Turning back to our financial results. Our strong second quarter financial performance reflected contributions from both the Commercial and Government segments. In the Commercial business, we grew our Local Group insured enrollment by 22,000 lives, bringing our year-to-date enrollment growth to 69,000, despite a market that is shrinking overall. Operating revenues were $10.3 billion in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of over $400 million or 4.1% versus the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to premium rate increases, reflecting overall cost trends in our Individual and Local Group businesses, as well as enrollment grew primarily in the Local Group business. These increases were partially offset by the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017, which improved affordability for our members.","Our second quarter 2017 operating margin for Commercial of 9.4% declined by 150 basis points from 10.9% in the second quarter of 2016. The decline was largely due to the impact of less favorable adjustments to prior year risk adjuster accruals, the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and higher performance-based incentive compensation accruals. The decline was partially offset by the impact of strong operating performance in our Local Group business and improved core medical cost experience in our Individual business.","In the Individual ACA-compliant business, our second quarter financial performance was in line with our most recent expectations. The overall morbidity levels of our enrollment identified in the first quarter has stayed consistent, giving us better line of sight into the expected claims experience. Our updated 2017 guidance continues to assume that this business will operate at a slight loss for the year. We're focused on mitigating the claims pressure through medical management capabilities.","At the end of June, we received the final 2016 risk adjuster and reinsurance data from CMS and have updated our accruals. We're pleased that the reinsurance rate of 52.9% was slightly ahead of our expectations and the significant risk adjustment receivable for the 2016 benefit year was in line with our expectations. The work to determine our final 2018 market footprint in the Individual ACA-compliant business is not yet complete. We expect to provide additional clarity on our final 2018 market footprint during our third quarter call, if not sooner.","As a company, our strategy has been and will continue to be to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level of confidence that these markets are on a path toward marketplace stability. Thus far, we have notified state regulators of our decision to largely exit the Individual ACA-compliant marketplace in three of our states, which represents a little less than 10% of our total Individual ACA-compliant enrollment. While we have filed initial rate request in all of the other states, it is important to note that those filings do not necessarily indicate the final level of participation. There are still many areas of marketplace uncertainties, principally, cost-sharing reduction subsidy funding that make it challenging to be comfortable with the level of predictability of a sustainable marketplace.","If we aren't able to gain certainty on some of these items quickly, we do expect that we will need to revise our rate filings to further narrow our level of participation. That said, we are closely monitoring state and federal legislative and regulatory developments. And if the level of uncertainty in the marketplace is reduced, we would have increased confidence in our ability to predict the appropriate level of market participation.","Switching to the Government business, membership was flat during the quarter, but we grew year-over-year operating revenues by 4.5% to $11.9 billion. Operating margin for the Government business was 2.5% during the second quarter of 2017, a decline of 150 basis points compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to higher performance-based incentive compensation accruals and the impact of the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. In our Medicaid business, our financial performance was largely in line with expectations outside of the Iowa contract. While our operating performance improved in Iowa versus the second quarter of 2016, it did underperform our expectations during the second quarter of 2017.","We continue to believe the medical performance of the business supports higher rates than provided under the current contract. We remain highly engaged in working to secure actuarially sound rates that reflect the acuity of the populations we serve. We continue to see a strong pipeline of RFP opportunities for future growth in the Medicaid business, and expect 15 to 20 RFPs to be released over the next year-and-a-half. The pipeline includes opportunities for new business in both new and existing states, as well as re-procurements of existing contracts which, in many cases, offer the potential for additional business beyond our current footprint.","Additionally, the pipeline is largely concentrated in new and specialized populations and services, such as long-term services and support and those with intellectual and developmental disabilities. In these areas, Anthem has a proven track record of providing market-leading capabilities, which are necessary to effectively manage these vulnerable populations.","In the Medicare business, our core gross margin performance was in line with expectations. We continue to expect to organically grow our Medicare Advantage enrollment by low to mid double-digit percentages over the next few years, with a financial contribution that is within our long-term targeted operating margin range. We also continue to target M&A opportunities to augment our growth profile.","Turning to discuss our updated 2017 financial outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of greater than $11.70 for the full year 2017, an increase of $0.10 from our previous outlook. Our updated outlook reflects the improved performance in our Commercial Local Group business and reflects the uncertain nature of the Individual ACA-compliant marketplace.","Finally, as it relates to our PBM strategy, our pharmacy team is analyzing our options to create the best long-term pharmacy solution. While it would be premature to share specifics regarding the RFP process, we remain very confident in our ability to drive significant value for our clients, members, and shareholders.","The RFP process has further validated our expectation to be able to lower our pharmacy cost by more than $3 billion annually, once we transition to our future state. Should we decide to leave Express Scripts, we're very confident in our ability to thoughtfully plan for the transition of our customers to our new solution.","A seamless transition for our members is a key component in our evaluation process, and we will be very focused on mitigating any potential abrasion for our customers throughout this process. We remain committed to informing the market of our long-term pharmacy strategy by the end of 2017.","With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our financial statements and provide additional details on our updated 2017 outlook.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, Joe, and good morning. I'll begin by discussing the consolidated financial highlights during the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $3.16. These results included net negative items of $0.21 per share. Excluding these items, our adjusted earnings per share was $3.37 for the quarter. These results reflect our strong underlying financial performance.","Operating revenues in the second quarter totaled $22.2 billion, an increase of $924 million or 4.3% versus the second quarter of 2016. The increase is primarily due to the premium rate increases across all lines of business to cover overall cost trends, as well as higher enrollment in our Medicaid, Large Group, and Medicare lines of businesses.","These increases were partially offset by the impact of the one year waiver of the non-tax deductible health insurance fee in 2017, which allowed us to reduce premiums in 2017 to help improve affordability. Additionally, the increase was partially offset by less favorable adjustments to prior year risk-adjuster accruals compared to the second quarter of 2016.","The benefit expense ratio of 86.1% in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 190 basis points from the prior year quarter. This expected increase was largely driven by the impact of the one year waiver in the health insurance tax, partially offset by improved medical cost performance in the Local Group and Individual businesses.","Our second quarter 2017 SG&A expense ratio of 13.8% came in higher than expected, but still declined by 20 basis points from the 14% in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the one year waiver of the health insurance tax and from lower administrative cost, which resulted from expense efficiency initiatives, coupled with fixed cost leverage on our strong membership growth. These decreases were partially offset by higher performance-based incentive compensation accruals and the 2015 cyber attack litigation settlement that was recorded during the quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet. We have included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the first half of 2017, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $951 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. Our reserves continue to include a provision for adverse deviation in the mid to high single-digit range, and we believe our reserve balances remained consistent and strong as of June 30, 2017.","Our days in claims payable was 40.5 days as of June 30, largely unchanged from the 40.6 days we reported at the end of the first quarter. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 38.1% as of June 30, 2017, a decrease of 160 basis points from the 39.7% at the end of the first quarter, which reflects the impact of the repayment of a $529 million note that was due during the quarter and an increase in our shareholders' equity.","During the second quarter of 2017, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of common stock for $458 million, at a weighted average share price of $182.83, bringing our total year-to-date share repurchases to 2.8 million shares at a weighted average share price of $180.37. As of June 30, 2017, the company had approximately $3.7 billion of board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining, which we intend to utilize over a multi-year period, subject to market conditions.","We ended the second quarter with approximately $2.8 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $846 million as of the end of the quarter. For the 3Rs, we have adjusted our accruals to reflect the final 2016 benefit year data received by CMS at the end of June.","As Joe mentioned, we were pleased that the reinsurance program came in slightly ahead of expectations and the risk-adjuster receivable we had accrued for 2016 was in line with our expectations. For the 2017 benefit year, we continue to maintain a significant net receivable position for risk adjusters, and we have not changed our accounting policy for risk corridors. Our historical results have not benefited from the amount due under the risk corridor program, and we continue to record a 100% valuation allowance for all unpaid receivables for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 benefit years.","Now moving to cash flow. For the second quarter 2017, we generated operating cash flow of $393 million or 0.5 times net income. Cash flow in the second quarter included the impact of making two estimated federal tax payments consistent with expectations. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow was $3.1 billion or 1.7 times net income. Our operating cash flow continues to reflect the impact of collecting an extra CMS Medicare payment in the first quarter, which is expected to reverse itself during the fourth quarter.","After adjusting for the Medicare prepayment, operating cash flow was still strong, reflecting the quality of our first half 2017 earnings. We used $172 million during the quarter for our cash dividend and our Audit Committee approved the increase over a third quarter dividend by $0.05 to $0.70 per share. With this increase, we have increased our dividend every year since we began paying a dividend back in 2011.","Turning to our financial outlook. We increased our operating revenue guidance for 2017 by an additional $500 million to a range of $88.5 billion to $89.5 billion. This increase reflects higher-than-expected premium rates in the Federal Employee Program and Individual businesses.","We expect our fully insured membership to be in the range of 15.2 million to 15.3 million, and our self-funded membership to be in the range of 25 million to 25.1 million as better-than-expected results in our Large Group self-funded business was largely offset by higher-than-expected losses in BlueCard enrollment. Taken together, we expect our total membership to be in the range of 40.2 million to 40.4 million members, nearly 300,000 to 500,000 lives higher than at the end of 2016.","Our 2017 medical loss ratio is projected to be 87%, plus or minus 30 basis points. We expect our SG&A ratio to be at 13.6% plus or minus 30 basis points on a GAAP basis, which includes the impact of the Penn Treaty assessments, the 2015 cyber attack litigation settlement, and Cigna-related transaction cost incurred in the first half of 2017. We expect our 2017 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 6.5% to 7% with a bias towards the lower end of the range.","We are encouraged by our first half 2017 operating cash flow and we project operating cash flows to be greater than $3.5 billion, including potential cash payments related to a portion of the Penn Treaty assessments and the 2015 cyber attack litigation settlement. Regarding capital deployment, our 2017 outlook continues to include the benefit from $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases during the year.","To conclude, our 2017 earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.35 on a GAAP basis, and we have increased our adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.10 per share to greater than $11.70. Our updated outlook reflects the better-than-expected operating performance in our Local Group business and the uncertain nature of the Individual ACA-compliant marketplace.","It is important to note that our outlook does not include any additional transaction or legal costs associated with the terminated Cigna acquisition beyond those incurred in the first half of 2017. Our outlook also does not include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI.","With that, operator, please open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. On the guidance assumption of greater than $11.70, was looking for more color on what's being baked in on the exchange margins and the outlook that it will remain negative for the full year, is that conservative? Or is there something on the 2R true-up that has driven continued conservatism?","And then, secondly, on the 2016 Iowa true-up, is that already in guidance for the Medicaid? And as far as the first half of 2017, have you included something where you haven't received the rate?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Hi, Ana. This is John. Thank you for the question. Let me see if I can answer both of those. So, in terms of our raising guidance to greater than $11.70 per share, the exchange business, as you know, there's a lot of moving parts associated with that. We had some true-ups here associated with the 2016 business, based on getting the final CMS information at the end of June. Fortunately, the true-ups were relatively small. The reinsurance paid out slightly higher than we expected.","But on the risk adjusters, we are quite pleased with the analytics that we had done prior and the fact that what we ended up in terms of our risk-adjuster receivers and the magnitude of the receivables that we are entitled to was virtually spot on what we had recorded, which really does show that we understand that line of business and then really do have very great data analytics associated with that. So, the true-up process itself really had minimal impact on our 2017 reported results.","And in terms of the outlook for the rest of the year, in the first quarter, there had been a bit of commentary associated with the morbidity, it was a bit higher than we had planned for, due to a shrinking risk pool and various other issues. So, we've adjusted our thought process for 2017 risk adjusters, and we believe that they're all relatively, appropriately stated in terms of what's been recorded for the first six months and what's expected for the last six months. So, I would not say that there's a significant amount of conservatism associated with the guidance related to exchanges, as much as I would say is that our track record was doing a pretty darn good job of predicting it. That's pretty much where we stand on that.","Related to Iowa, we've not finalized a rate increase for July 1. We did experience higher-than-expected claims during the second quarter of 2017. I'm not really going to go into much more detail than that. Yeah, we did, at the beginning of 2017, receive a partial payment associated with a portion of the 2016 losses into the 2017 period. And we continue to work with the state in Iowa in order to come up with actuarially justified rates for the future. So, we really haven't taken that into consideration yet. We're hopeful there's some conservatism in those numbers, but until we finalize the work with the state and get actuarially justified rates, that's still a bit of an open item. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, everybody. Thanks. Just \u2013 maybe I'll ask about the capital deployment. I know \u2013 if I look at what you did in the current quarter, that's consistent with your $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion you might even to \u2013 $1 billion in target for the year, you might even need to step up a little bit in the back half to get to where you're trying to be, but I also know that coming out of the Cigna transaction, I think Joe had mentioned in the spring at some events that there were some tuck-in MA-type of deals that you were looking at.","Something \u2013 maybe things along the line of the Simply Healthcare deal you did a few years ago. Can you update us on your thinking about capital deployment there? And I know, Joe, you have a lot of interaction in Washington. Do you have \u2013 have you gotten any sense of the administration and their views on industry consolidation relative to what you may have faced in previous administrations?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, A.J. Thanks for the question. Let me briefly address the capital and then I'll turn it over to Joe to \u2013 and he wants to talk about the rest of your question. So, in terms of the capital, you're exactly right that we've begun our share buyback once the Cigna deal was terminated. And your thought process on we may need to do a little bit faster acceleration in the second half than we have so far, I would say, on a weekly basis, we are exactly on track to delivering that $1.5 billion to $2 billion, because we didn't start the share buyback until into the second quarter, because we didn't have the finalization of the Cigna thing until several weeks into the second quarter. So, when you look at our path that we have in terms of share buyback on a weekly basis, we feel very good about our ability to deliver back to the shareholders the $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So, anyway, Joe, I'll turn it over to you for the other part of A.J.'s question.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Right. Good morning, A.J. Thanks for the question. Very quickly, maybe chop your question up into a couple parts. First of all, regarding some prior comments regarding M&A around MA, we still are very focused on examining markets, market by market looking at opportunities. Yes, we're still mindful of the opportunities for tuck-ins. We think that there certainly are opportunities that we should focus on very carefully and so we're going to continue that pursuit.","As you know, we've got a MA platform that is now restructured and completely ready for expansion, both organically as well as by way of M&A. So, we're going to keep our options open. We're going to continue to look at the right fit for us in the markets that we believe where we can perform at a very, very high level. And so, we do have teams that are very actively engaged and focused on the best proposition possible.","M&A, broadly speaking, is still a very significant long-term strategy for us given that \u2013 kind of an overarching theme is that it's still all about access, affordability and quality of services, both with respect to service as well as safety. We're very mindful of that fact that scale does matter in this pursuit, and we will continue to very carefully examine the marketplace to assess our optionality, our targets and hopefully create fits that are really synergistic with respect to how we're going to best serve the marketplace.","Great example of \u2013 you may recall, a few years ago, the acquisition of Simply Healthcare probably stands out as the kind of transaction that I think and will be incredibly beneficial for the company, not just serving the marketplace, but also from a financial perspective being a great fit with respect to the synergies that I mentioned a moment ago, Simply was a incredibly well-run company. And I think we're very pleased to be able to, brought that into our portfolio, then being able to leverage off of that significant strength that it brought to us and continue to expand in the Florida marketplace. I think that \u2013 hopefully that's a response to the question about M&A and more specifically MA open for more questions there.","With respect to the political landscape, I think we're all very observant of what's happening. I don't think it's an exaggeration by the hour, leading up to just maybe a week or so ago, we tried to stay very, very engaged in sharing our thoughts about what it would take to stabilize the marketplace. We do have ingredients that we have continually communicated as sort of the recipe or the ingredients to create stabilization in the marketplace, the ingredients that we believe will repair the Affordable Care Act issues that we've come upon repeatedly over the last few years, and we do believe we have been heard. A.J., with respect to how that all might play out in the end with respect to policy decisions that will be made by way of a vote in Congress, I think, is anybody's guess, but quite frankly, we do believe we have the ability to share our opinions, our voice is heard, and we're hopeful that the kind of stabilization, we believe, is essential to best serve our marketplace is going to be embedded in whatever may come out of Congress.","There are other points of view that maybe nothing will happen in the short run. I can't weigh in on that at all. I don't know. But again, we're very hopeful, and we do believe that stabilization is a distinct possibility and obviously, as I said, we will continue to make the contributions necessary for our voice to be heard, as well as the voice of the industry overall. So, thanks for the question, and I look forward to maybe talking more about this as these policy decisions are created and put into force.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the Individual business. First, in the three states where you're downsizing next year, do they contribute a disproportionate amount of the losses this year? I know it's a small percentage of your membership, but would love to get a sense for how profitable those states are.","And then, Joe, you commented that you might have to revisit your rates for 2018 if the level of uncertainty changes. Is that primarily CSRs? Or are there other reasons that you might have to come back and look at the rates? Thanks.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Chris, thanks for the question. I'll address the first half and that's about the three states. As you indicated, it is a very small component of our membership associated with individual exchanges. In terms of profitability, it really is not significant, one way or another, in terms of the overall profile for the Individual book of business. So, it in and of itself is not a significant driver in terms of 2017 expectations.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. John, thank you very much for that comment. With respect to rates, you asked a question about what other characteristics of the market might influence our decisions around rate adjustment. Clearly, CSR is a standout. We've repeatedly said that that aspect of pricing and the subsidies that support membership in our markets can translate to as much as a \u2013 maybe 18% to 20% uptick in premium, if subsidies aren't granted. It remains to be seen whether that will ultimately be allowed, but if not, then obviously we're going to have to revisit our pricing market by market in order to judge whether or not pricing adjustment is necessary or even if re-entry on any measure of scale is appropriate.","As I said earlier, so much is dependent on stability of each of those markets of which you may know. We have 139 rating regions and so those rating regions are going to be carefully analyzed, sliced and diced and then determined if quite frankly a rating \u2013 or excuse me, a premium increase is tolerable beyond a certain point, and if in fact we will be able to remain as an active participant in those rating regions.","Right now, as you know, our extraction represents about 10% of membership and our hope that between now and, let's say, through September a lot of decisions will be made, but I can't underscore that time is of the essence, and some of our critical decisions may have to occur in a relatively short period of time. So, I would tell you, the decision making is going to be, as they say, fast and furious and time is of the essence for us to make the right decisions for the benefit of the markets we serve, the membership we serve, as well as for the company overall. John?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, Joe. And, Chris, I was just going to maybe expand on your question about, is CSRs the only issue. Maybe a sort of think through what that means when we talk about CSRs. CSR \u2013 without CSR funding, as Joe said, we're talking about incremental 20-plus-percent rate increases. Well, we have 20-plus-percent rate increases with CNRs (38:40), so those are additive to each other.","And in order to come up with a target margin with that level of rate increase is really a very difficult thing to do. And you look at \u2013 gee, if CSRs are not there, then what does that do to the number of people who are actually going to participate in the exchanges? And so then if that changes, how does that impact the risk profile or the risk pool associated with it? How will that then impact our ability to collect risk adjusters and the price for that and the various other aspects? So, there really is \u2013 this one item impacts multiple things downstream in terms of how we look and assess at these things. So, I just wanted to make sure it wasn't just the CSR, it was all the ramifications and there are many associated with that.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. And John's absolutely right, there's a cascading effect. One other key ingredient, which is material, is the tax. And the tax, if it were to have the moratorium lifted, it's probably something on the order of 4% to 5% premium increase, so you can see the compounding effect of all of these issues that don't map to stabilization that then creates this cascading effect that John mentioned earlier. So, again, that's all included in our analytics specific to 139 rating regions that we are looking at very carefully to judge the in and out decisions that we have to make.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi there. A couple of things. Thanks for the question. One, with respect to Iowa, what are your options? What if you don't get what you view as actuarially sound rate, can you exit? I'm not sure what the contract gives you in terms of latitude. And then in D.C., I understand the whole issue with CSRs. How much can the administration do? Like if the Trump administration stops saying, we're not going to fund this, we're going to let it implode, is that enough or do you need legislation and where do you think the administration can do something and is willing to versus where you need to see legislation? Thanks.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Two parts, one, Iowa; one CSR in terms of further exploring that issue. Regarding Iowa, we got a great state partner and, obviously, we've been engaged in dialogue with them now for a quite lengthy period of time and we're very hopeful that, as John pointed out in his remarks, the actuarial soundness that we're pursuing, I think, will be made clear and the right decisions will be able to occur. And again, it's a work in process and I think going beyond, any kind of conversation at that level, I think, is not appropriate given the intricacy of the dialogue that we're having with our state partners.","And with respect to contract terms, obviously, probably, in fact, cannot go into those terms at this time, but in the main we do believe that over time we'll be able to have the right kind of facts laid out that demonstrates the degree of adjustments that are necessary to create the actuarial soundness that we need to continue to serve the membership in Iowa. So, we're optimistic, but it is truly a work in process.","With respect to CSR, there are a variety of paths and, obviously, the first path focuses specifically on action taken by Congress and if CSRs will be embedded in some type of legislative model and that's going to have to kind of play out based on the votes that occur in Congress. Absent that, and again I don't want to predict where all of that might go with respect to yet again another path, but obviously, there may be other choices that may occur related to funding by other means. Funding specific to an action taken by the administration, but I think put it altogether, I believe that the leadership that we deal with in Washington are very mindful and fully aware of how CSR really maps to stabilization and, in particular, the effect on premium increases for the people that we serve across the country. So, I think it's \u2013 that too is a work in process, but it's yet \u2013 remains to be seen exactly how that funding will flow to us to support our marketplace. We just don't know yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from BMO. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Question, if you could just \u2013 you had mentioned higher-than-expected enrollment losses or maybe it wasn't losses, maybe it was slower growth in the BlueCard product. Can you just talk about that and talk about your outlook for your own large employer, ASO National Account enrollment going into next year and how good a vehicle you think BlueCard is going to continue to be for you?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, thanks, Matt. So, in terms of the BlueCard, as I had \u2013 in the prepared comments had talked about that that was an offset to some of our other gains in terms of our overall membership outlook. And just to remind everyone, BlueCard is where it's another Blue Cross and Blue Shield carrier and owns the account and has sold the account and their member as a resident in our state is a typical methodology of how we obtain BlueCard membership, and that was a bit lower.","However, as we look at the national account selling season, we really are pleased with the expected growth in membership for 2018. It's been a bit quiet for large jumbo national accounts, but we're a very strong player in the market and we expect to at least hold, if not, increase our market share in the national account space. We've had some great success with zero trend guarantees related to first-year customers. We have consistently delivered on that guarantee, providing value, saving customers medical cost. And we already have received a few RFPs for 2019, so we feel pretty good about our positioning, and quite honestly we're not all that worried about the small drop in BlueCard membership year-over-year, because we think that national accounts is \u2013 that the sales cycle is going to work its way out and that we're going to do just fine.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about the PBM or RFP process, and understand you can't go into the specifics on who is bidding what right now. But if you could talk a little bit about what you've learned going through the process, in particular, your views on hybrid versus outsourcing, your views on which functions perhaps are best housed within your company. And also what segments on the insurance side do you think would benefit the most from a growth perspective from the improved pharmacy rates?","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Great. Lance, thanks for the question regarding PBM. Questions really come at us repeatedly on this point and obviously, it's evolutionary from the very beginning back in January of 2016. And go back in time, we've always stated that we would make it very clear, quite frankly make a clear statement of the choice we've made in terms of contracting by the end of the fourth quarter and we still are committed to that.","With respect to that, we've been engaged in a very analytical process. You all well know that RFPs went to the market and we now have received those RFPs and are in an analytical mode that's very thoughtful, very thorough. And as we've repeatedly said, we think our pursuit has always been about optionality and kind of constructing a hybrid model has been one of those options that we've carefully evaluated, meaning that we have probably multiple paths that can best serve our customers, our members, whether it's a mail order proposition that is sent out to someone to administer by way of maybe private labeling it, the fact that we will always retain control of our formulary, and then other characteristics of a hybrid model, which represents various constructs within a model that equates to great value for our membership.","Of course, the other extreme would be to send it all out to another vendor and so we've always been mindful of the many choices we have, which I think speaks to the power, the significance of optionality being very much in our favor. We've stood by, as you well know, our expectation in terms of $3 billion per year in terms of savings, go forward at 01\/01\/2020 and beyond and nothing that has occurred thus far has moved us off of that expectation. And so again, we're working very carefully with respect to the analytics around an RFP.","I do want to underscore that it's not just about the money. It has a lot to do with customer service, our commitment to a transition that is virtually seamless. Given the complexities, we well recognize that and so whichever direction we go in, we will be very careful in our choices regarding best serving our customers with a seamless transition. So, it's obviously a complicated formula for success, but it's literally \u2013 it's all hands on deck to get us from today to 01\/01\/2020 and I feel really good about the path we're on and I don't think there are any complexities that we aren't aware of and working on. And I think we again feel very, very good about the process and what potential will come our way in terms of very positive characteristics beginning 01\/01\/2020. John?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, Joe. And, Lance, in terms of the second part of your question of growth areas, I'm not understating this when I say that it will impact and help every line of business we have. And in terms of existing business, it will be very significant for new business and maybe specifically the question you're looking for is that we believe it will make our Medicare business that much more competitive, our Medicare Part D that much more competitive. We are growing that because of all the other benefits and things that we offer to the marketplace, we think it'll really help accelerate the growth in that area.","And then in the Large Group ASO, it's not uncommon to have a PBM carve-out as part of the National Accounts or the Large Group ASO, and we believe that we can minimize the PBM carve-outs on that in the future, that's just two examples, but when I say it will help every line of business, we believe it will help every line of business. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just got a quick question on Individual and then a follow-up on Medicaid. So, Joe, on the Individual ACA-compliant business, you've previously indicated a focus on getting to profitability here in 2018, or exiting where you needed to. Understanding that there're still unknowns, should that still be our expectation next year in terms of how you're making decisions in this business?","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Justin, thanks for the question specific to this continued formation of the ACA marketplace. We've always said that our target is 3% to 5% margin. We certainly haven't backed off of that. As you can imagine, toward the day-to-day grind of best managing that portfolio is governed in large measure by rules of engagement and the stabilization necessities that I talked about earlier coming to reality.","Our sense is that stabilization is a distinct possibility. We are still committed to the 3% to 5% margin performance and we're also committed, as I've said repeatedly over nearly a year now and going back to last summer, kind of worked off the characterization of surgical extraction, we still are very focused on that as well. And I think, Justin, that we will make the right decisions with respect to engagement in the market, detachment from a market.","Our hope is that we will be able to continue to perform in a very robust and meaningful manner in all 139 rating regions, but so much depends on how legislative process plays out and what stabilization rules are put into place, but again I'll reiterate, we're still hopeful that a 3% to 5% margin is achievable. And so, John, I don't know if you want to add to kind of the outlook and how engaged we are in making that a reality.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. So, no, Justin, as Joe said, we're committed to that. I just maybe wanted to reframe the 2018 commentary you said. Back in 2014, we did extremely well in exchanges. And then, 2015, we ended up being closer to breakeven, and that's when we really saw how the co-ops were pricing on an irrational basis, some of the other issues were going on in terms of the stability of the marketplace. And we've looked at it and thought it would take a few years for all that to work its way through, again, for some of the co-ops to continue to exit and we predicted that it wouldn't be until 2018 until the marketplace obtains stability.","So, we still, as Joe said, believe that that's possible with the appropriate regulatory and legislative changes. But as you've phrased your question, I would say, the short answer is yes. We want to ensure that there is a path to target margins in a sustainable marketplace. Did you have a follow-up on Medicaid?","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Just to repeat, Medicaid rates for 2018, anything you could tell us there, and specifically the governor's budget indicated in California that 2018 Medicaid expansion rates might be cut high single digits. Just want to hear what you guys saw there in California Medicaid expansion, particularly. Thanks.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Justin. So, in terms of 2018, the Medicaid, it's a little premature to talk about the specificity and we really would prefer not to talk about any one state. We're closing in on being in 50% of the states of America in terms of providing Medicaid services. And as you can imagine, within all those states, some do a little bit better and some don't do as well as we would have liked, and it's really a portfolio type approach.","And it's really, I think, premature to discuss any one particular state, especially for 2018, other than to say that we are extremely high on the pipeline associated with future Medicaid opportunities and continue to capitalize on that. And we do see it as a growth area for the company, even without Medicaid expansion in the future with all the other various long-term support services; aged, blind and disabled; and various other things that are all part of the future pipeline. So, Medicaid clearly is continuing to be a growth area for us in the future. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. We're seeing an investment cycle pickup at your peers in adding to IT and analytic assets, especially in the artificial intelligence area which feeds into strategy decisions around benefit design and underwriting. So, can you speak to where Anthem is in the investment cycle on IT? And what Anthem is doing specifically on the AI front?","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Sarah, that's kind of the question that is very powerful perspective on the future of our industry. I've been a great believer that so-called secret sauce for our performance in the marketplace moving into the future is all about translating data to information, meaningful information that supports our provider community, especially in terms of better choices that they can make in and around evidence-based practice. Information that supports the needs of our consumers given the significant risk position that they're now being subjected to in terms of higher deductibles, etcetera. They need to make very well-informed decisions in terms of accessing healthcare and remaining healthy. Therefore, we are very committed to the wellbeing of all of our members.","In that regard to your point about artificial intelligence and the foundational aspect of how you support the development of useful information, we're investing quite heavily with respect to data infrastructure, foundational buildout with respect to our IT systems. We are definitely using artificial intelligence today and optimizing our ACA benefits across 139 rating regions and actually, this has been a three-year journey for us in the AI space specific to that process.","Again, I do want to underscore we will recognize that this is the future of a very successful health benefit manager and in that regard, the appropriative amount of funding is being distributed, allocated to our technologies that will advance artificial intelligence that can best support the needs of all the interests that we engage with, whether it's a provider or a consumer, government, what have you, we are intimately involved in building out that kind of capability today. Hopefully in the near future, we'll be able to talk more about that. So, thanks for questions. Very appropriate and very significant.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management.","Chris Rigg","Good morning, and welcome to Anthem's second quarter 2019 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division.","Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our second quarter financial results, followed by comments on our key business initiatives and enterprise-wide growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail and go over our updated 2019 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our Web site, Antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Gail.","Gail Boudreaux","Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Anthem's second quarter earnings call. Today, we reported second quarter results that were ahead of expectations. During the quarter, we generated GAAP earnings per share of $4.36, and adjusted earnings per share of $4.64. Our second quarter performance reflects improved execution across the enterprise and the strength of our diversified platform. Based on the strong first-half 2019 results and confidence in the remainder of the year, we have increased our full-year GAAP net income guidance to greater than $18.34 per share, and adjusted earnings per share guidance to greater than $19.30 per share, an increase of $0.10 from our prior guidance.","Our total medical membership at the end of the quarter was 40.9 million, an increase of 1.3 million consumers served compared to the second quarter of 2018. Membership growth was broad-based, with continued strong performance in our Government Business and substantial improvement in our risk-based group Commercial Business. Overall risk-based membership represents more than 85% of our total growth. At investor day, we committed to multiyear growth across all business segments, driven in part by our improved pharmacy cost position through IngenioRx. As you know, we accelerated the launch of Ingenio and successfully began migrating members on May 1st. At this time, we've received transition approvals from all 14 commercial states and a majority of our Medicaid states. As a result of our accelerated progress, we now see the 2019 earnings contribution from IngenioRx trending toward the upper end of our $0.70 to $0.90 guidance.","As part of our build out of IngenioRx we've recently opened our state of the art 24\/7 pharmacy care center in Las Vegas providing both member support and eventually dedicated specialty patient care. The multidisciplinary teams of nurses, pharmacists, and technicians are working together, supported by our digital engagement tools to provide personalized support to improve the experience and health outcomes for consumers. The benefits of the move to IngenioRx are immediate for our clients and members, and we are on track to have all of our members on the IngenioRx platform by January 1st of 2020. While there is still work ahead of us, the dedication of the 2,500 individuals focused on this transition has been extraordinary and a key driver of our success.","The strong value proposition of IngenioRx is resonating in the marketplace. And we are pleased that we were selected by Blue Cross of Idaho to provide pharmacy services, effective January 1st, 2020. Our partners at Blue Cross of Idaho see the value of our best-in-class capabilities, and appreciate our commitment to deliver more affordable care and a simplified consumer experience. While our focus remains primarily on existing client transitions for 2020, we are increasingly confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities across the marketplace for us to bring innovative pharmacy services back for our medical clients. Across Anthem we've been investing in digital innovation to create more personalized and integrated experiences for employers, state partners, consumer, and care providers.","One of the areas where we see an opportunity to directly improve the health of the people we serve is with the launch of Anthem's electronic personal health record. Our electronic personal health record gives consumers access to their own electronic health record containing claims history, lab data, and CMS' Blue Button data through a secure and easy-to-use mobile application. We believe the easier access to this information for consumers and their families will empower them to be more engaged in healthcare decisions and support greater alignment and communication with care providers. The electronic personal health record will be available to our commercial and Medicare members in the fourth quarter, and will roll out to all members by early 2020.","Another area where we are focused is helping consumers manage their health and benefits in a simpler, more personal and integrated way. By leveraging our engagement capabilities with solutions, like Anthem Amplified, we are able to deliver a consumer experience that brings together account-specific plan benefits, personal medical records, and care provider selection tools to best meet individual needs. With Anthem Amplified, consumers have access to four key capabilities, a health checker that works to identify symptoms using voice and digital interactions, a transparent marketplace that provides customers with upfront information around cost before they even go to the doctor, a scheduler that helps find nearby care providers and set up appointments, and finally, a retail-like experience to pay for services directly from a laptop or mobile device.","Our investments in technology are designed to create more personalized, transparent, and convenient solutions for our consumers and customers. We are also leveraging digital solutions for our care provider partners by embedding these tools in our value based program, like enhanced personal healthcare, which is driving more appropriate use of services, strong adherence to clinical treatment protocols, and significant cost efficiencies. Our ongoing approach across our local markets is focused on helping consumers make informed decisions, driving sustainable outcomes across all aspects of wellbeing and reducing overall costs.","The growth of our value-based care model is accelerating. Through the second quarter, approximately 59% of medical spend is tied to value-based care, ahead of our full-year target of 58%. In addition, 36% of value-based care is now tied to shared savings programs, which is also tracking ahead of our full-year target. I'm excited about the impact of the investments we're making in our digital programs and value-based care models to help us to achieve our mission to improve lives and simplify healthcare. We will continue to develop innovative solutions that benefit our stakeholders across the continuum of care.","Our Commercial business performed well in the quarter with total margins solidly above 10% due to higher penetration of value added services and specialty offerings in our fee-based business. Sales of specialty and clinical programs helped drive a strong upper single-digit increase in core administrative fees and other revenue. The robust growth was despite the expected seasonal decline in fee-based membership proving that our cross-selling efforts are yielding results. In our risk-based business, we remain on track to achieve our 2019 membership growth of 150 to 300,000 members.","Medicare Advantage is performing well and our strong capability in this area is positioning us for solid multi-year growth. More than 50% of our growth in individual MA this year has been driven by market share gains. It's clear that seniors value our supplemental benefit offerings like our unique over-the-counter solution that improved overall affordability and the retail experience for our consumers.","We expect continued growth in our individual business over the balance of the year. And we expect to achieve our full-year mid double digit growth target. Further, our dual special need membership has increased nearly 300% since the end of 2015. And we now have the number one or two market share position in our states today. In the group Medicare segment, the pipeline is robust and several recent contract wins give us confidence in our ability to deliver another year of strong growth in 2020 and bring us closer to our goal of serving 800,000 members by 2023.","Over the last 12 months, we have added nearly 700,000 members in Medicaid including approximately 65,000 members in the quarter. We were pleased to recently be awarded the statewide contract for Florida Healthy Kids effective January 21st 2020, taking our strong Simply brand from four regions in the state to all 11 regions in support of children's health and wellness. The Medicaid pipeline remains robust. And our outlook for future growth is aligned to our ability to provide innovative solutions to our state partners and drive better value for our members.","Importantly, our pending acquisition of Beacon will further enable us to capitalize on opportunities to serve complex and specialized populations in Medicaid as well as the overall behavioral health needs of more than 60 million consumers. This acquisition is a significant milestone for growth in the diversified business growth and will meaningfully expand our footprint in the growing behavioral health market.","Our success today in behavioral health has been due to our highly coordinated whole person approach to managing care. Beacon's proven ability to manage chronic care population and specialized expertise will strengthen us in this space as we continue to pursue growth both organically and through alliance partnerships. At Anthem, we recognize that we play an important societal role regarding some of the most critical issues facing Americans today. For many of the nation's most vulnerable population, we have a unique opportunity to remove social barriers.","With that in mind, we recently launched the Food is Medicine program with Feeding America, the nation's largest domestic hunger relief organization. The partnership will work hospital outpatient clinics to indentify and assist people facing food and security, a problem that affects almost 12% of all households in a given year. By improving access to food, we can better manage the high cost of care for our state partners while empowering consumers to better manage their health and well being.","We are also taking a strong stand related to the environment. As a healthcare company, Anthem recognizes the link between environmental health and the health of our consumers and communities. And we are committed to continually improving the environmental sustainability of our operation. To that end, we recently joined RE100 which is a global initiative bringing together influential businesses focused on renewable energy.","As after of this effort, we are committed to sourcing 100% of the electricity used in our offices with wind and solar energy by the year 2025. We are proud to be the first health benefits company to join the RE100 alongside other leading brands in our push from more sustainable planet. As we have noted before, this is a new era in Anthem. Our business results shared today and our strategic plan moving forward are driven by our continued focus on our culture with our mission, vision and values. By doing so, we are enabling our 60,000 plus associates to expect more of themselves and create real change for those we are fortunate to serve.","And now I will turn the call over to John to discuss the second quarter financial results and our revised 2019 outlook. John?","John Gallina","Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As evidenced by our earnings release, the strength of our businesses drove balanced growth for the quarter. Today, we reported second quarter GAAP earnings per share of $4.36 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.64 exceeding expectations and positioning us to deliver on our commitments.","Second quarter operating revenue was strong and outperformed expectations reaching $25.2 billion an increase of nearly 11% or $2.5 billion over the prior year quarter. On adjusted basis, growth and operating revenue was approximately 13% and ahead of our projected long- term revenue growth of 10% to 12%. The increase is attributable to premium increases to cover overall trend, robust membership growth across both our government and commercial segments and yet another quarter of strong growth in administrative fee revenue driven by increased sales of clinical and value added services across our businesses.","Medical membership ended the quarter at approximately 40.9 million members representing growth of 1.3 million members over the prior-year quarter. The growth was driven predominantly by our risk based business which increased by 1.1 million members or growth of nearly 8%. The medical loss ratio was 86.7% for the quarter, an increase of 330 basis points from the second quarter of 2018. The increase was largely driven by the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2019 and a continuation of elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business. The SG&A ratio was unchanged sequentially at 13%, an improvement of 210 basis points over the prior-year quarter, the improvement was driven almost equally by the absence of the health insurer tax and solid growth in operating revenue attributable to membership gains in Medicaid and Medicare. ","Our results illustrate the strength of our diversified platform as challenges in our Medicaid business were more than offset by our other business areas. Our Medicaid business continues to be within our target margins albeit at the low end of the range but we remain confident and fully expect our margins to improve as we continue to work with our states on a daily basis to ensure the rates we receive appropriately reflect the acuity of our membership.","It is important to note that the challenges we are facing in our Medicaid business remain isolated to a handful of states and are very manageable given the size and breadth of our overall portfolio. Our medical management capabilities and operating platform are unmatched. Core competencies that are widely recognized by our state partners is evidenced by our industry leading RFP win rate compared to both our diversified and pure play competitors alike. We are pleased with our continued growth in Medicare. Year-to-date, our total Medicare Advantage membership is up 16% and a significant driver of the impressive top line growth I mentioned earlier.","Moving to commercial, membership has grown nearly 300,000 members compared to the prior-year quarter. It is important to keep in mind that our second quarter 2018 commercial segment results benefited from a favorable risk adjusted associated with 2017 ACA business.","With that said, our second quarter 2019 commercial operating margin was a solid 10.4% reflecting the team's progress towards increasing the penetration of clinical and other value added services. Consistent with last quarter, we continue to expect our local group medical cost trend in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.","Turning to the balance sheet, our debt-to-cap ratio was 39.4% at the end of the quarter. We repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $272.95, totally approximately $458 million. In total, we have repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock year-to-date.","Operating cash flow was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up $895 million from the prior year, and represent 1.1 times net income for the first six months of 2019. Days in claims payable was 39.1 days, an increase of 0.6 days sequentially and in line with expectations. Looking ahead, we now expect full-year 2019 total operating revenue of approximately $102 billion, with premium revenue increasing by $2 billion at the midpoint driven by our outlook for higher-than-expected growth in fully insured membership. Fully insured enrollment is now expected to be in the range of 15.6 to 15.8 million lives, and self-funded enrollment is now expected to be between 25.4 and 25.5 million lives. All together, full-year medical membership is now expected to be in the range of 41 to 41.3 million members.","The medical loss ratio is now expected to be in the range of 86.2% to 86.5% due to the aforementioned trends in Medicaid. The SG&A ratio is now expected to be in the range of 13.2% to 13.5% due to the greater than expected revenue growth and administrative expense efficiencies. Taken together, we now expect full-year adjusted net income to be greater than $19.30 per share.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. So, cost trends have been a pretty big topic recently, and some of your peers have been talking about thinking about long-term trend in terms of CPI or national health expenditure plus or minus, how do you think about the right framework for long-term cost trend discussions? And then thinking through the levers there, one that's been coming up recently is outcomes-based pricing for gene therapy or medical devices. So is Anthem doing anything on that front, and is it meaningful to your long-term cost trend management?","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you, Sarah, and thanks very much for the question. I think it's actually a really important question because this issue of overall challenge of affordability I think poses one of most significant issues [ph] to our members, and we're committed to ultimately driving the lowest cost. One of the most important levers is this ability to move to more value-based care. And as I shared in my opening comments, enhanced personal healthcare is an area that we've been focused and have made a significant commitment to move up to 60% of our spend in value-based care arrangements, thinking about the alignment of consumer spending to care provider alignment, I think that's really the best opportunity for long-term management of the trend issues.","Specifically to pharmacy, we recently reported -- you probably saw in our 2018 drug trend report that we have been successful at keeping drug trends relatively flat and focusing on total cost to care. And again, I think our best opportunity to rein in overall escalation in cost is to think about whole person health, which is managing the alignment of incentives at the care provider lever with the incentives around pharmacy, and so that total costs are ultimately managed. And we have seen that in specific areas like inflammatory disease such as Crohn's and ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis, for example, where members have seen anywhere from an 8% to 12%, if not more, savings per month and average lower inpatient hospitalizations, et cetera. So that overall contributes to our overall quality.","So in terms of your broader question, I think it's absolutely the right one that we should be asking. And I think we should be looking for all of our value-based care, both for pharmacy, the integration of social, as well as the integration of behavioral health. And that's one of the reasons we're excited about bringing Beacon into the fold for Anthem, that our best chance to manage sole [ph] trend is going to be aligned with managing those components in value-based arrangements.","Thank you very much for the question. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matt Borsch","Yes, I just wanted to ask about the group commercial pricing environment, and the context is as investors and us analysts are looking at your results, the mix of metrics here we see somewhat elevated medical cost ratio offset by other items in the results is what in fact we saw at two of your peer companies that have reported so far. And so maybe it's all just Medicaid, but people are looking at that and trying to understand if there's more competitive pressure that we need to be concerned about.","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks for the question, Matt. Let me start, and then I'm going to ask Pete to give some additional commentary on sort of the marketplace dynamics. But I think first to your specific question about trend. As you saw, we reiterated our 6% plus or minus 50 basis points trend. So our trend in commercial has been extremely consistent. And we do not feel that there's -- that issue in commercial, it's lived up to expectations. In terms of the overall marketplace, it's always been a competitive marketplace, the pricing has remained very rational in the markets, and we have not see that kind of scenario over the course of this year or even last year. But I'm going to ask Pete maybe to give a little bit more dynamic input about the market specifically.","Pete Haytaian","Yes, thank you, Gail. And to be specific about our MLR and operating gain, as we talked about in the prepared comments, the one-time issue associated with risk adjustment that we experienced in 2018 versus this quarter, and 2019 was really the major difference is it relates to medical cost trend, as Gail said, it remains pretty steady. We feel pretty good about where we are relative to that 6%. And then more importantly, as Gail noted, the marketplace remains very competitive but rational. We are not seeing anything unusual occurring in the marketplace. We feel very good about our position, as we've talked about on prior calls; we're very focused on being disciplined but also growing. We're continuing to see that growth.","In our large group fully insured business we've had nine out of 11 months of sequential net growth, and we continue to see improvements in that regard. So overall a competitive market but rational, nothing irregular at this point.","Gail Boudreaux","So I guess in summary, very consistent with our expectations, and nothing really has changed.","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes, hi, good morning, and thank you for your comments on the BR, so, just trying to dig a little bit deeper into that, could you just help us quantify some of these moving parts? You point to the Medicaid book of business. Can you give us some more sense on what specific states you're seeing the higher cost, and how do you think is that going to progress in the second-half of the year given that you've upped your guidance there?","John Gallina","Yes, thank you, Ricky. This is John. And unfortunately we really don't talk about state-by-state specific situations in Medicaid. We're in 23 states right now, going on 24 by the end of the year, and really review and discuss our Medicaid as a portfolio of assets and a portfolio of businesses. With that being said, yes there are a few things that maybe I'll point to specifically that can help you with your modeling. We continue to work with our state partners on a regular basis to get the rates that are appropriate for the risk and the acuity of the populations that we're serving. Many states have gone through a fairly significant re-verification effort ensuring that only those Americans who are eligible to receive Medicaid benefits are actually receiving Medicaid benefits.","When the rates were first set they were set on a slightly different population and a mix of members than what we are serving today. And so as I said, we continue to work with the states to ensure that we're getting appropriate adjustments associated with the mix of membership as it works through. And there are several states that we actually have received increases in our rates in the second half of the year and we expect that that will help improve the MLR and improve the profitability of the Medicaid business in the second half of the year. So thank you for the question.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks. Just on a similar topic on the last one, I know you don't want to talk about individual states but again we're thinking about Medicaid. You mentioned popping up in a few states as far as the higher costs just curious to be able to comment on whether you're seeing the costs occurring maybe in some of your newer Medicaid markets where you still may be assessing where the cost trends could normalize within the membership and relative to your provider network or are you seeing it maybe in more some of your older more mature Medicaid markets, just curious if there is any clear trend when thinking about it that way? Thanks.","John Gallina","Thank you, Steve for the question and I do want to have a clarification. We have not stated that we have seen an increase in medical cost. We have said we've seen an increase in benefit expense ratio and that increase in benefit expense ratio is because the premium reimbursements that we're getting have not fully compensated us for the risk that we're taking on an overall portfolio.","Back to the point that I made on Ricky's question that if states are going to re-verification there is an incidence of the mix of the membership that we're serving is different than what the pricing and the rates would have been based on. So yes, there's clearly there's a mismatch between the risk of the members that we are serving today and the rates that we're receiving today. And Felicia Norwood and her team are visiting with our state partners on a regular basis if not a daily basis in some cases to ensure that the rates are appropriately reflected. And that's one of the unfortunate parts about the Medicaid businesses is that the amount of the premium that you receive and the risks that you are incurring do not always exactly align on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We've seen that typically over the course of a year that they'll be normalized, that rates will be adjusted appropriately. But when you're looking at any one specific quarter or any quarter-over-quarter comparison, it's always apt to be skewed a bit because of the mismatch that I discussed. So thank you for the question.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks I'll just on the MLR train here for a second. My question is more is that your MLR was 90 basis points above consensus. I was hoping you could tell us how the MLR looked versus your internal expectations and maybe split out the driver of first the negative TYD in the quarter and you raised guidance by 30 bps, was that to reflect what you saw in the quarter or your point like is that the back half of the year should be higher even despite these better Medicaid rates? Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks Justin and I would let John continue with the answers. Thanks John.","John Gallina","Yes, thank you. Thank you, Justin for the question. In terms of the MLR and how it compared our internal expectations. The MLR was slightly higher than our internal expectations here for the first half of the year in the second quarter which is why we are raising our guidance, which is why we have spiked it out as is a reason for the fact that our MLR is above the analyst consensus in total. So I think that all really does align in terms of the PPIA that you stated, the PPIA is one metric. It's obviously a metric that a lot of folks really do like to focus on but it is only one metric.","I would say our reserves are very consistent and conservative the way that we've approached it. We continue to have a margin in the mid to high single digit range for average deviation. But we are investing quite a bit of money in informatics and data, in systems and it is actually providing us better information and better insights into our inventory data. And so not only is that being utilized to help serve the members, it is also being utilized to help set reserves and I think we should see maybe a bit less volatility in reserves in the future associated with the fact that we have better information and we've even discussed in the past, some of the claims processing speeds have improved as well, 97% of our claims are submitted via EDI and 88% of our auto adjudicated, so the speed and accuracy is actually very, very good. And so then as you look at that one metric associated with PPIA, you have to look at other metrics in conjunction with that and the fact that our days and claims payable has increased a bit.","Our cash flow as a percent of net income was 1.3 times for the quarter, 1.1 for the entire year-to-date. And I think we're very comfortable that the reserves are stated appropriately and quite nice, I go through all this just to let you know that it's really not impacting the MLR guidance per se, the MLR guidance is based on the Medicaid MLR being higher than expected which really has much to do with the revenue that we're getting is not exactly matching the risks that we're taking right here in the second quarter. Thank you.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A. J. Rice","Thanks. Hi everybody. I just if I could slip in a clarification, Pete had mentioned the risk adjuster headwind this year versus last. Is that any way to quantify the year-to-year impact of that on the MLR or the dollar change, and then my bigger question was around your comments on Ingenio. You said that you're going to be toward the high end of your expectation. Is there any way to talk about where you're trending ahead of what you thought and obviously nice to win with BCBS Idaho. Any background on that opportunity, does that give you any learnings for next year's selling season as you think about moving forward?","Gail Boudreaux","Okay. Quite a few questions there A.J. we'll try to take them sequentially. Let me have John address the risk adjuster question broadly and then I will take the others.","John Gallina","Great. Thank you, Gail. So yes, so A.J., on the risk adjuster and I just want to make sure that this is being characterized appropriately and we're asking and answering the proper question. So risk adjuster in 2018 in the second quarter we had a very nice positive true up and that was predicated on our 2017 individual ACA membership. And as you recall that was before we had made the decision to reduce our footprint due to the instability and uncertainty of that marketplace. And so we had approximately 1.6 million individual ACA members in 12\/31\/17 and then the true up we received in June was predicated on that block of business. And then fast forward 12 months and we received a true up in June of 2019 associated with our 2018 membership.","That true up was positive. It was relatively small and it was extremely consistent with our expectations. And so the headwind is not a negative true up, the headwind is that the value of the true up in 2018 was significant and the value of the positive true up in 2019 was relatively small, but as I said in accordance with our guidance and our expectations.","Gail Boudreaux","Right and again that's the comp quarter-over-quarter, I think is what John's trying to really point out there. And overall as I said in the opening comments, we feel very, very strongly about the performance of our commercial business which perform extremely well in the quarter as well as year-to-date.","In terms of IngenioRx, a couple of things one first we're extremely pleased with the way, the transition has gone as I shared again in my opening comments. In terms of us raising our guidance, when we originally gave our guidance I think what is important to recognize this was a very accelerated transition. We felt confident about it but we also realized that we needed to get state approvals both at the commercial and Medicaid level. So we didn't have exact clarity on when those would come in. What we see now is that we converted several million members in the quarter. And then again beginning in July several million more those have gone well. We have received most of the regulatory approvals on the Medicaid side and all of them on the commercial side. And so now given our growing confidence in this conversion, we feel much better about the high end of the range and that's really the driver for what we're seeing in terms of raising the guidance, and again very strong execution by our pharmacy team.","So overall that's really the driver and we feel very confident about kind of where IngenioRx is delivering value particularly the significantly improved G&A costs. In terms of Idaho, we're thrilled with the sale to Blue Cross Blue Cross of Idaho and again our focus as we've shared has been on transitioning our current clients, so we are in the sales cycle.","We're pleased that Blue Cross of Idaho was one of our first customers to come on board and I said as I shared with you again I think it's strong sign of the value that we're bringing to the marketplace and also the improved service model. We do have a very strong pipeline going into 2021 as you realize many of these sales are very long tail two, three years based on the contracts in the PBM and the large account business, but we think a real big opportunity for us is the opportunity to bring back pharmacy into our Integrated Medical clients. That's an area that over the last several years that we have lost quite a bit of that integrated business and our value proposition is very strong, so we're optimistic about that but we see that going really more into the latter half of 2020 and into 2021. Thank you very much for the question. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Yes, just a quick clarification on Medicaid and just trying to understanding this re-verification issue predominantly. Are you taking any actions to try to further impact medical costs beyond what you ordinarily would be doing just in recognition of that sort of issue? And then my broader question is really great, great win with Blue Cross of Idaho as you're looking at the different services and partnerships, you have with the Blues. What are the areas that we should be thinking of is like the more immediate meaning 2021 sort of opportunities as Medicaid, is it AIM or what would it be PBM?","Gail Boudreaux","Great. Thank you very much for the question Lance, I'm going to have Felicia address what's happening in our Medicaid business, I think she can talk broadly about the initiatives.","Felicia Norwood","Thank you, Lance, and good morning. As John said earlier, the Medicaid challenges that we're facing are really isolated to a handful of states and given the breadth and size of our portfolio and the ongoing work that we do on a daily basis with our states we felt very confident about being able to manage through that. In terms of our medical management capabilities, we really have industry leading capabilities.","Our operating platform is unmatched. Our core competencies are certainly widely recognized by our state partners as really recognized by the industry leading win rate that we've had. We've always had a focus on whole person health particularly in our Medicaid business and the ability to be able to manage not just, it's you know the medical conditions and pharmacy conditions but also those social barriers have been a driver for us. So we feel good about the capabilities we have on the Medicaid side in terms of managing our members effectively. And I think as we work through these issues in the handful of states, we'll continue to see improvements both respect to our overall Medicaid performance.","Gail Boudreaux","Great, well, thanks Felicia. In terms of the second part of your question Lance, I would say almost to all of those we see opportunities across a very wide range of partnerships with different Blue plans but also outside of Blue plans care provider partners are also areas that we have done a number of different things. So, on the specifics, so clearly our Medicaid partnerships we're very pleased with that, we'll be bringing North Carolina live in the fourth quarter hopefully as that goes by. We've got additional partnerships there with our care more business as well to offer care delivery services more broadly to that population.","As I think about Ingenio, we clearly see opportunities for Ingenio to partner with other Blue plans across either their entire population even subsets of that population. Beacon does quite a bit of work with other Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and we see that is an opportunity to further expand and Aspire has also strong relationships. So as you can see we see a breadth of potential opportunities both inside of the Blue Cross system but also with care provider partners. And today even just to give you one quick example in the Medicaid space, we have eight partnerships fiber with Sister Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and three are with care provider relationships.","On Medicare because of our strength in the dual eligible population, we're going to be expanding our partnership in Louisiana to dual eligibles beginning in January as well. So again a pretty broad based operation for us. And so we're not just focused on growing one specific business or line but really kind of meeting the needs of each of those plans and where they have potential gaps and potentially how we can put together very unique situations.","The last thing I would add is as you saw probably recently some of the announcements around our digital capabilities. We also believe that those will be very strong offerings for us to work with other Blue plans around consumer engagement and care provider integration and those things we think will resonate very strongly in the market and actually support the other businesses that I shared with you at the beginning. So thanks. Thank you very much for the question. And next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, maybe one clarification before the question, just to make sure the Ingenio number that you're talking about is more about kind of pulling for the aggregate savings, if you're not changing your kind of two-year aggregate savings number, just want to make sure you have that right, but my real question is really about MLR unfortunately. So just wanted to see you are saying that the issues on the Medicaid side, would love to hear some comments about on the commercial business and on the Medicare business, how the MLR is trending there. I just want to make sure it's line because you are showing pretty good growth in both of those businesses. Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","Let me answer your first question. Yes, you are right. Your assessment on Ingenio is in line. And then John I will ask you to respond to the MLR question.","John Gallina","Yes, thank you Kevin for the question. And as I think Pete had referenced earlier, the MLR in commercial is actually very much aligned with what our expectations have been. As we review and evaluate the cost trend, we have reaffirmed today the 6% plus or minus 50 basis points cost trend in commercial that is something that has been consistent for the entire year. And then we continued to reaffirm that guidance.","Medicare has been certainly consistent with our expectations as well. We are really quite pleased with our growth in Medicare, having 16% growth rate already through six months and expect to continue to improve. The group retiree business within Medicare which you didn't ask about specifically but just for clarity purposes that business typically dilutive when it first sold. And it takes awhile to get the care management programs to get risk scores, get the information accumulated so that we can get appropriate reimbursement based on risk adjustors and various other aspects like that.","But, it's actually performing in line with our expectations. We did expect it to be dilutive in the first half of the year and it was. But it's very much in line with the expectations. So I would say we feel very comfortable with the performance, and the growth both in our commercial business as well as our Medicare business. And that the MLR pressures that we are seeing as a consolidated company really relate to the lack of appropriate premium and reimbursement rates on the Medicaid businesses.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks, morning. You have mentioned a couple times now that Medicaid rates aren't sufficient I guess in a handful of states. I am assuming you have some visibility on the kind of the year ahead. We obviously recently got the Iowa rate. So are you comfortable looking ahead that you'll get the better rates? Or, are we at a point of potentially exiting states? Thanks.","John Gallina","Hi. No, thank you for the question, Ralph, and clearly that is a very appropriate question. Something that we need to be looking at and evaluating on a state by state basis, however, we are very comfortable with the future state aspect of Medicaid. Medicaid does have the $80 billion pipeline that we have been talking about for a while over the next five years, and we do believe that we can garner our fair share of that.","The acuity of that pipeline is skewed more to the higher premium type businesses whether it's the aged, blind, disabled, long term support services or others. And we will be very disciplined in terms of how we approach that, how we price for that to ensure that we are being appropriately reimbursed. But no, we are not at the point now that we are talking about exiting states. We want to be a partner with the state. We believe the states like us. As a partner, we have provided a significant amount of value and savings to these states over time. And it all boils down just getting the reimbursement correct. So we feel very good about the both the short term and the long term trajectory of the Medicaid business.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Tanal","Good morning, guys. Unfortunately, I also wanted to just ask about MLR and then I don't fully just get this one thing sort of like the way the claims payable table which suggests there is about 40 million of unfavorable prior year development in the quarter. And it was favorable about 160 last year. So, sort of a 200 million swing there in isolation would have pressured MBR by about 85 bps year on year, but then in the release you sort of note that claims reserves establish that yearend and developed moderately better. So, first just trying to understanding what was actually built into guidance on that point and also where the negative development kind of emanated from by business. And finally on this whole thing, just hoping you might comment on how MLR trended year-on-year and commercial and [technical difficulty] side of Medicaid.","John Gallina","Sure, Steve. Thank you very much. The PPA metric that you stated was consistent with the how I answered Justin Lake's question a few minutes ago associated with that are reverses are very consistent and that we do have explicit conservatives inbuilt into those. The better information we have, the better insights has certainly provided us clarity in terms of our loss reserves. And it's just one metric. Days and claims payable has increased, cash flows has been very positive 1.3 times net income. And so, we feel very good about the situation.","One other thing just to really clarify when you are looking at the prior year number, that's based on the 12\/31\/17 run off. And the 12\/31\/17 run off had 1.6 million individual ACA members in it. And we had announced a few months earlier that we are going to exit 65% of the footprint associated with the individual ACA. And so, we are a very conservative in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with our reserve picks on the ACA -- individual ACA business, and that turned out to be redundant which you are seeing in the go-forward footnote from a year ago.","So all in, we actually feel very comfortable with the business. There is no surprises here. There is no new news. Medicaid has been performing under our expectations. Commercial and Medicare have both been performing consistent with our expectations. And we actually feel very good about the revenue adjustments and the revenue enhancements that we are expecting in Medicaid in the second half of the year. And then, we will continue on with the strong performance in the commercial and Medicare.","Gail Boudreaux","The only thing I would like to add to John's comment is Medicaid is performing within our range although at the low end of the range so that is little bit more clarity on that. So overall we still believe that the Medicaid is very good business, but again you see this in the Medicaid business where trying to align the mix of the business against the payments that you receive and that's why we often see outer period payments in Medicaid.","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hi, just one clarification for Gail and a question for John. Gail, just wondering on Ingenios as we think about it, you mentioned the strong 2021 pipeline and a big Priority is moving Anthem's own book to Ingenio by January 2020. So I guess you really hadn't thought much about the opportunities for large external client wins for 2020 such as Idaho. So this is sort an anomaly or is there really more opportunity there than perhaps we have considered?","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks for the question, Gary. First, we are really pleased with the win. So I don't know that I would call it an anomaly. We are out in the marketplace. This is more just about the timing of contract renewals. And I think our -- in fact we have been -- we have not being aggressively selling, just given the amounts of conversion that we wanted to make sure that went really well for our clients. But we are clearly out there talking to clients and sharing our value proposition.","So I wouldn't call it an anomaly, but I would also say that we really do believe that it will be more in '21 and beyond just because of the timing. And it is hard for many clients to move off of the cycle that they currently have. And that would be more in line with expectations, but we would like to see certainly the integration of our medical and pharmacy story is really strong. And that we think that there is opportunities to do more in 20. Thank you.","And the second part of the question again, please?","Gary Taylor","When you cite few of the different factors impacting the MLR year on year including Medicaid and RRR et cetera, one thing you don't talk about is the possibility of pretty significant ramp and the ESI contract cost that Cigna has talked about in the closing years here. So is a reason that's not pressuring MLR year-over-year, just that that was well known by you in advance and would have been reflected in pricing?","John Gallina","Yes, thank you, Gary. That's an excellent question. And as we have stated, we believe that we are being overcharged by an excess of $3 billion by Express Scripts based on our contractual provisions. But that was known and it was baked into our numbers. The trend that we are experienced pharmacy, while it's higher than we would like, it's consistent with what we planned for at the beginning of the year. So, thank you.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Back to the Blue Cross of Idaho question, congratulations on that, Blue Cross of Idaho I believe used CVS as their PBM previously and uses CVS for Ingenio as the backend. How much easier did that make it to win that client because of the CVS? Because most of the other Blue Cross Blue Shield plans use either Express or Prime. How much harder will it be for you to win business away form Express and Prime rather than from CBS customer?","Gail Boudreaux","Yes. So thanks for the question. I think overall, the opportunity win is really because of the strong value proposition that we bring to the marketplace. So, I really focus on the Ingenio we built a brand new service center. I think we have got the state-of-the-art capabilities that are far superior to many in this space right now. And honestly, we have the experience working as a Blue plan ourselves and understand how to serve that marketplace very very well. And this gives us an opportunity. It's part of our whole person health to integrate those type of concepts in terms of our analytics, our digital platform, the integrated teams that we put in our Las Vegas center. So we are starting really with kind of a blank sheet of paper which makes this the next generation PBM. And I guess I was focused more on that because I think that's the value proposition that we bring to the marketplace versus targeting any individual competitor and trying to beat them. I mean we are trying to create a brand new value proposition.","Thank you very much. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I had the question regarding the senate finance committee drug pricing bill that was introduced yesterday, and then wanted information particularly in -- first, Medicaid eliminating spread pricing for PBM. And I believe the senate health committee is also looking to eliminate that perhaps in the commercial market. Can you talk about sort of the privilege at this point of spread pricing and PBM contracting maybe in general or particularly with Ingenio? And our estimate -- we are estimating maybe is less than 2%. But can you talk about sort of how you see that impacting your business here? And then obviously, there was a redesign in the Part D program or proposed redesign the Part D program should be more cost put in catastrophic to the plan. How do you see that maybe impacting how premiums are set or any impact to the part D plan sponsors? Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks, Charles. Quite a few questions there, and I think first and foremost where we are all aligned is on the affordability of pharmacy and that we need to ensure that we have strong programs in place quite frankly on total cost, total net cost meaning total cost of premium as well as what consumers pay ultimately. In terms of -- you mentioned a number of things that are happening right now. And there are a number of things going on in the house and the senate around pricing whether it's spread pricing or some of the other issues that you brought up on Part D.","I think first and foremost we are in the midst of providing comments on that and actively engaged in that. And I think given that these have been recently released and a lot of it depends on the details. I think it's immature for us to comment publically on where we think these are going to end up. Again, we are committed to ensuring that we get sort of the best lowest net cost. And we clearly align sort of the states -- and if you asked about Medicaid where our states are, we clearly align with the rules of our states and same thing with the federal government on Medicare.","So, overall, I think there is going to be a lot more discussion, debate, and input where you need to get to a lot more other details on specifically how these programs are going to work. But at this stage, I think the ultimate judge needs to be the lowest net cost both from cost to consumers but also premium cost ultimately, so all parties involved. So, I can't really provide much more guidance on that because at this stage I think that there is still lot more details around these proposals and how they would work.","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Styblo","Hi, good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Dave Windley. Just had a question about the Medicaid, I think management has done a great job of explaining how it's isolated to the handful states. Curious about the risk that this could bleed into other states, that there might be a second wave that could come at some point and how debate discussions are evolving just not beyond the shortlist that you guys have talked about. And then as a follow-up would management care to comment about the EPS cadence in the back half of the year since there are still many moving parts with Ingenio coming on and some of the earlier wins that were dilutive in the first half becoming more breakeven or positive in the second half.","Gail Boudreaux","I think John will answer the second part of your question and then I will ask Felicia to comment a little bit about just sort of the environment in Medicaid. But I do commend everyone for getting multiple questions and quite a few, so there is quite a few, then we'll try to adjust all of them, John please.","John Gallina","There is a lot of multi part one questions, but thank you for the question and the cadence of our EPS seasonality, because you know, our seasonality certainly has changed, and it's changed over the years. A few years ago, it changed when the elimination of the reinsurance program occurred throughout the ACA. It changed again when we exited the ACA, and now it's changing again with the launch of Ingenio, and it will change next year due to a full-year impact of Ingenio. So, thank you for clarifying or allowing me to clarify that the earnings seasonality has and will continue to change on a quarter-over-quarter basis.","in 2019, there are a couple of other things very specifically that are driving our year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter seasonality. I talked about the commercial risk adjustment for the ACA was fairly significant in the second quarter of 2018, and it was a positive adjustment in the second quarter 2019, but relatively small. And that clearly is impacting our year-over-year seasonality. Our mix of business continues to change, and I'm not sure that everyone is truly reflected just how much our mix of business has changed over the past several years. You go back 10 years ago, we were a commercial company. We had over 70% of our revenues was generated from our commercial business area, and look at the second quarter results today, over 60% of our revenue was from our Government Business Division. And the Government Business Division has a bit flatter seasonality typically than Commercial does. And so, clearly that's continually changing.","And I have talked about some of the auto period adjustments on Medicaid, and the fact that they don't always align. As we look at the second-half of 2019, we do see some revenue enhancements in Medicaid, given some of the recent rate actions and some of the other common conversations we've had with our state partners. But also thinks like -- when we went live with our partnership with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota from Medicaid, in the fourth quarter of last year, we encouraged significant administrative expense to be prepared to have a very clean and flawless one-one '19 transition to that membership. And that trend went relatively well, and now we expect the second-half of '19 for it to be accretive, working its way towards our target margin range for a new line of business, or a new state. And so, when you're looking at the second-half of 2019, you have the cost of implementation, and you look at the second-half of '18, the cost of implementation in the second-half of 2019 you have the accretion.","And the same thing is going on with the group retiree business. My reference is that was diluted at the beginning, and it is dilutive but it's improving throughout the year. So, a lot of moving parts, but we are very comfortable with the overall aspect of our numbers.","Gail Boudreaux","Great. May be Felicia give a little commentary about the state?","Felicia Norwood","Sure. And thanks for the question, Dave. As we said, that was -- there were elevated cost pressures in a handful of states, but the discipline around working with states for perspective rates happens in all of our states. So, our teams are engaged in almost a daily basis, and working with our states around understanding what's happening with the emerging experience of our Medicaid membership, and the mix issues that we discussed before.","So, the other thing you should understand too is all the state's rating periods are different. So they are not on a calendar year. They happen at different times of the year, and in addition to that there are also opportunities from mid-year rate adjustments. So, the rate process in states is very complex, dynamic, and very iterative in terms of the work that we have to do on a daily basis. So, while the pressure is certainly isolated in a handful of states, the discipline around the work that we do with our states on a day-to-day basis happens consistently across all 22 or so of our markets.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Great, thanks. I appreciate you guys fit me in. I'll be brief I guess. Just on Idaho, if you could just walk us through the process of that, was there a formal RFP, and if so, when did that happen, and maybe just let us know what resonated -- what were the big takeaways that they weren't getting from their previous administrator that they're looking forward to you guys?","Gail Boudreaux","Yes. Well, thanks, Josh. Obviously we don't get into detail about specific customer RFP situations, and that kind of detail. It's confidential and it's obviously competitive in nature, but I guess what I would say is, our new platform, our transparent approach, focus that we put on digital integration and consumer services I think are resonated, and our ability to really understand, quite frankly, how that business is managed and try to help them improve their overall affordability and cost would be the key winners, and we have a very compelling value proposition. Overall we believe we have best-in-class rates in contracting and that combined with really solid integration I think are really kind of -- were part of the reasons for the win.","So, thanks for the question. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Thanks for fitting me in. Actually just wanted to shift back over to group MA and was hoping maybe to get some numbers just around the membership pipeline opportunity for 2020, maybe just first if you could dive in terms of the number of lives of the contracts that you have already secured that you mentioned? And then overall how large the membership opportunity is on the group MA pipelines of 2020? Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","Great. I will let Pete comment on that.","Pete Haytaian","Yes, sure, Scott, thanks for the question. Yes, we feel good about the group MA business as you know, last year we started off at around 20,000 members, we have grown that into the year at 150,000 approaching around 160,000 members. And as we have talked about, we are going to end the year this year approaching 200,000. We still feel good about that. A lot of our opportunities we talked about before comes from our conversion opportunities, which means that we have a captive pipeline of self-funded clients that see the value proposition here, and we continue to see that escalating, and our value proposition resonating, and we feel good about the future year growth of the Group Retiree business.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Newshel from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Michael Newshel","Thanks. Can you comment on some of the recent policy proposals related to negotiated commercial rates? So we have the Trump executiv0e order on transparency and also surprised billing bills that would payout in network at the local median rate, do you think either of these could have any effect on relative cost advantage, does it help competitors with higher unit cost at all?","Gail Boudreaux","So, couple of different things going on, and let me first talk about price billing. We very much support that consumers do not have surprises, and part of our contracting strategy is to bring in all of those care providers into our networks. So, when an individual consumer goes to somebody in network, they should not have to deal with something that's outside of the network, and that's something that we have long advocated with our care providers, and so we are obviously very supportive of that. We want to ensure that there are the appropriate protections for consumers and that they balance the incentive to providers, but we don't replace that obviously with costly bureaucratic processes. So that would be one thing on surprised billing, but overall we are very supportive of helping consumers have the fine cost and really understand that.","In terms of the second one around transparency of cost, again, we have been a long supporter of enabling consumers to really understand what the costs are. We think it's less valuable to have individual unit costs by procedure, and that's one of reasons our engaged platform allows people to really truly understand how much something costs against their benefit plan and what their true out-of-pocket costs will become. A great example of -- you know, think about a member who needs an MRI, the average cost maybe $1,200, which is great to know if you look at the individual components. But actually it may only cost $50 out-of-pocket, because they have already met their deductible, and that's way more helpful, and then they can also compare different facilities and look at not just cost, but also quality. As I think of that though the price transparency issue is -- the other issue in terms of competitiveness for us is our move to value-based care I think really changes sort of that one's focus on just unit costs. So I believe our movements of value-based care will drive cost down to a much more reasonable level, and that's where our strategy is. And so, I don't see just the unit cost issue being the dominant issue, and I think that we have to think about transparency around total cost here again for the entire procedure and how it affects consumers directly and that they can make decisions based on what they're paying out-of-pocket.","Thank you very much for the question. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Frank Morgan","Good morning. A lot of my questions are answered, but maybe go back to Beacon acquisition, just the timing there on that closing of that acquisition, the possibility of additional deals, cross-sell opportunities, and would that be affected by this transition of Express Scripts, or would that be totally unrelated? Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","In terms of Beacon, what we've shared is that we are planning on working towards the fourth quarter close, and we are working through obviously all the approvals that are required there.","In terms of your second question, it really doesn't have any relationship to that. Completely separate issue; what it means for us in the future, we are excited about Beacon, because again, it gives us part of our whole person care strategy, our movement towards -- you know, very much focused on value-based care, which I just spoke about, areas that we are focused on social issues and now the behavioral issues, those three combined I think allow us to much more effectively manage total cost of care. So, we are excited about Beacon. It gives us the scale solution in growing area, and a very important area for us. It focuses on the special aid populations in Medicaid. So we've seen them in many of our markets, and feel that this would be a very, very strong offering for us.","So, again thank you for the question. And next question, please?","Operator","Your final question today comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Rob Cottrell","Hi, good morning. This is actually Rob Cottrell on for Steve. Just wanted to stay on individual Medicare for 2020, now that bids have been submitted, just wondering if you can provide any commentary on outlook as well as what if any change you expect in the Medicare business now that you have Ingenio cost position? Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","Great, I will ask Felicia Norwood to answer, please.","Felicia Norwood","Thank you very much Rob for that question. As we think about 2020, we take a real balanced approach in structuring our offerings [ph]. We evaluate both our benefit designs as well as the competitive landscape. We certainly appreciate the increased flexibility that's come from our federal partner around the 2019 benefit offerings when we made some changes with respect to social determinants of health benefits, and frankly I think we were leaders out there in trends of that space. We will be making some modest improvements with respect to those offerings, because we believe that they certainly can be differentiators with respect to our products in the various markets.","Going forward, the story hasn't changed very much. We've been delivering very strong growth in the individual MA space, and certainly our approach is to make sure that we have competitive benefit designs out there, while also making sure that we are maintaining our pricing discipline with respect to this business as we go forward. So, thank you.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you, Felicia. And thank you to everyone for allowing our call to go little longer than normal. We felt it was important to respond to everyone's question. We appreciate your questions for our team. Our performance in the first-half of this year gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on future growth prospects and deliver better outcomes and better value on behalf of our members and shareholders.

At this time all lines are in listen-only mode. Later there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","And I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management.","Doug Simpson - Anthem, Inc.","Good morning and welcome to Anthem's third quarter 2017 earnings call. This is Doug Simpson and with us this morning are Joe Swedish, Chairman, President and CEO; and John Gallina, our CFO. Joe will begin the call by giving an overview of our third quarter financial results, discussing our business unit performance, and providing some qualitative remarks around our strategic positioning and high-level headwinds and tailwinds going into 2018. John will then discuss in more detail our key financial metrics, performance during the quarter, and provide some details on our updated 2017 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectation. We advice listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Before we discuss our third quarter financials, I wanted to take a moment to highlight the acquisition of America's 1st Choice that was announced last night. America's 1st Choice is a Medicare Advantage company that offers HMO products, including Chronic Special Needs Plans and Dual-eligible Special Needs Plans. America's 1st Choice currently serves approximately 130,000 members through its proprietary technology tools, managerial processes, and member engagement programs that helps the company deliver efficient, cost-effective healthcare services to its members. Its two health plans in Florida receive a 5.0 and 4.0 Star Rating for 2018. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018 and be slightly accretive to earnings in year one.","Turning to discuss our third quarter financials, we announced GAAP earnings per share of $2.80 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.65, reflecting continued strong execution across our businesses. We ended the third quarter with 40.3 million members, translating to a growth of 338,000 lives since the end of 2016.","We continue to be pleased with the enrollment trends in our Commercial group insured business, which grew again during the quarter. Our Individual enrollment declined by 83,000 lives in the quarter, as expected. As of September 30, 2017, our total Individual enrollment was approximately 1.7 million members, consisting of 1.4 million ACA compliant members and approximately 300,000 non-ACA compliant members. Of the 1.4 million ACA-compliant members, a little more than 900,000 were from the Individual exchanges.","Finally, our employer self-funded business grew by a little more than 100,000 members during the quarter, as we continued to win new sales and benefit from an improving labor market. Our membership results translated into top line growth that continues to be solid, with consolidated third quarter operating revenues of $22.1 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion, or 4.6%, versus the third quarter of 2016.","The benefit expense ratio in the third quarter of 87% came in slightly better than expectations, reflecting improved claims trends in Individual, continued strong performance in our Local Group insured business, and the impact of a retroactive revenue adjustment in Medicaid.","Our third quarter SG&A expense ratio of 13.6% came in higher than expectation, as we increased spending on our growth initiatives during the quarter and recorded slightly higher than expected incentive compensation expense due to the outperformance in the quarter.","Finally, cash flow remains very strong and we generated over $2.4 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter, bringing year-to-date operating cash flow to $5.5 billion, or 2.1 times net income. John will go into more detail in a moment, but our third quarter operating cash flow is impacted by several timing items that are expected to reverse in the fourth quarter.","Moving on to our business unit results, our enterprise earnings reflected contributions from both our Commercial and Government segment. In Commercial, operating revenues grew by 4.1% versus the prior-year quarter to $10.1 billion in the third quarter of 2017. The increase was mainly driven by premium rate increases, reflecting overall cost trends in our Individual and Local Group businesses, as well as enrollment growth primarily in the Local Group business. These increases were partially offset by the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017, as well as lower current year risk adjustment accruals versus the prior-year quarter.","Our third quarter 2017 operating margin for Commercial of 5.3% declined by 130 basis points from 6.6% in the third quarter 2016. The decline was due to the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and the higher investment spending in the current year quarter. The decline was partially offset by improved medical cost experienced in our Individual business, as well as the impact of continued strong operating performance in our Local Group insured business.","Our Specialty business continues to perform well in 2017. Our dental membership has now increased by 317,000, or 5.8%, this year and vision membership has increased by 517,000, or 8.1%, this year. As a company, we continue to make the necessary investments to capitalize on our opportunity to improve the Specialty penetration rate of our medical book of business.","In the Individual ACA-compliant business, our third quarter financial performance was slightly better than our most recent expectations. As a result, our updated claims projection for 2017 have improved, as the morbidity of our population is slightly better than we previously estimated and our medical management efforts are positively impacting our results. These improvements are partially offset by a reduction to our current year risk adjuster receivable estimates.","Overall, our updated 2017 guidance now assumes that this business will be relatively breakeven. It is important to note that our outlook currently assumes that CSR subsidy cut does not have a material impact on our results. However, additional regulatory clarity is required for us to fully understand the financial impact of ending CSR subsidy.","In 2018, our Individual ACA-compliant market participation will look materially different than it does today. As a company, our strategy has been and will continue to be to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level of confidence that the financial performance in these markets is predictable. We will offer Individual ACA-compliant products in 56 of the 143 rating regions across our 14 states in 2018.","To put our 2018 market footprint into perspective, the rating regions where we are no longer participating represent a little more than one-half of our expected 2017 Individual ACA-compliant membership. In addition, we were selective in the plan offerings we put into the remaining markets. In total, we believe these actions will cause our Individual ACA-compliant membership to decline by approximately 70%.","There were multiple factors that were considered in each market to determine whether or not continued participation was appropriate. Unfortunately, marketplace instability created a variety of uncertainties, including cost sharing reduction subsidy funding. The uncertainty around CSR subsidy funding was an important factor, as we engaged in constructive dialogue with state regulators and evaluated the appropriate levels of participation.","Based on the information we know today, we are expecting our 2018 Individual ACA-compliant membership to be slightly profitable in 2018, albeit below our long-term target operating margins of 3% to 5%. We are continuing to closely monitor state and federal legislative and regulatory developments. And if the level of uncertainty in the marketplace is reduced, we would have increased confidence to reenter certain rating regions in 2019.","Shifting to the Government business, operating revenues of $12 billion in the third quarter grew by 5% compared to the prior year. Operating margin for the Government Business was 3.8% during the third quarter 2017, a decline of 40 basis points compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to the impact of higher investment spending in the current year quarter and the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017, partially offset by the impact of retroactive revenue adjustments in the Medicaid business.","Our margin performance was in line with the expectations in the Medicaid business, excluding the impact of a retro revenue adjustment, which had previously been expected to be realized in the fourth quarter. We continue to work with the State of Iowa and CMS on approving final 2017 rate increases, and we are hopeful that this process will be completed by the end of the year.","We continue to see a significant RFP pipeline of opportunity in the Medicaid business over the next five years, largely within specialized services populations. In addition, we're looking to continue our momentum in forming strategic alliances with other health plans that allows them to utilize our best-in-class Medicaid operating platform and enables us to further augment growth.","In the Medicare business, our core gross margin performance continues to be in line with expectations. We're pleased to have grown membership again this quarter in our Medicare Advantage business. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of HealthSun, a South Florida Medicare health plan and a provider system, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. The HealthSun acquisition is an example of our commitment to expanding our footprint in an attractive geography with a well-run asset.","We're also pleased with the CMS Star Ratings that were recently released. More than 60% of our 2018 Medicare Advantage membership will reside in 4.0 Star or higher plans, a meaningful increase from the 22% we had in 2016. Additionally, three of our plans received a 5.0 Star rating, and the HealthSun and America's 1st Choice assets each have a plan that received 5.0 Star Ratings as well. We feel very well positioned to continue to capitalize on our growth opportunities in the Medicare Advantage business going into 2018.","Before I turn the call over to John, I wanted to provide a few high-level thoughts on our financial outlook. For 2017, we increased our adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $11.90 to $12. As it relates to next year, we're currently developing our 2018 plan. There are a few high-level headwinds and tailwinds that we've identified, which will impact our financial performance next year relative to 2017. The primary headwinds to earnings that we are managing through are, the return of the health insurance tax and the timing impact of midyear contract renewals, which we expect will impact 2018 by a little more than $0.40 per share, and the impact of fixed cost deleveraging from Individual ACA-compliant market exits. As I stated earlier, we currently expect our Individual ACA-compliant footprint to decline by approximately 70%, which covered fixed costs that otherwise would've been allocated elsewhere in 2017.","For tailwinds to earnings in 2018, we expect continued enrollment growth in Medicare, Medicaid, Specialty, and employer self-funded product offerings. Next, improved profitability in the Individual ACA-compliant business, from relatively breakeven in 2017 to slightly profitable in 2018. Normalization of incentive compensation expense is another category which is expected to be higher than target based on 2017 financial performance. And finally, capital deployment during 2017, including M&A activity and share repurchases, which were more weighted to the back half of 2017, as well as all of 2018.","Taken together, we're targeting a growth rate in 2018 that is consistent with our long-term growth expectations in the high single- to low double-digit range when you exclude the impact of the health insurance tax. We expect to provide more details around our 2018 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our third quarter financial performance and updated 2017 outlook in more detail. John?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, Joe, and good morning. I'll begin by discussing the consolidated financial highlights during the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.80. These results included net positive adjustment items of $0.15 per share. Excluding these items, our adjusted earnings per share was $2.65 for the quarter. These results reflect our continued strong underlying financial performance.","Operating revenues in the third quarter totaled $22.1 billion, an increase of $972 million, or 4.6%, versus the third quarter of 2016. The growth was primarily driven by premium rate increases across all lines of business to cover overall cost trends, as well as enrollment growth in our Large Group, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid businesses. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the one-year waiver of the non-tax deductible health insurance tax in 2017, as well as lower current year risk adjustment accruals compared to the prior-year quarter.","Our benefit expense ratio of 87% in the third quarter increased by 150 basis points from the prior-year quarter. This increase, which was slightly better than expectations, was largely driven by the impact of the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax, partially offset by improved medical cost performance in the Individual business. Additionally, we benefited from a retroactive revenue adjustment in the Medicaid business, which was expected to be received in the fourth quarter.","Our third quarter 2017 SG&A expense ratio of 13.6% declined by 120 basis points from the 14.8% in the third quarter of 2016. The decrease, as expected, was primarily driven by the impact of the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and the impact of fixed cost leverage on operating revenue growth. These items were partially offset by the impact of the increased spend to support growth initiatives during the current year quarter.","Now turning to the balance sheet. It's been our practice, we have included a roll forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the first nine months of 2017, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $1.1 billion, which continues to be better than our expectations. Our reserves continue to include a provision for adverse deviation in the mid-to-high single-digit range, and we believe our reserve balances remained consistent and strong as of September 30, 2017.","Our days in claims payable is 40.5 days as of September 30, unchanged from the 40.5 days we reported at the end of the second quarter.","Our debt-to-cap ratio was 38.5% as of September 30, 2017, unchanged from the end of 2016 and an increase of 40 basis points from the 38.1% at the end of the second quarter, and reflects the impact of share repurchase activity during the quarter.","We repurchased approximately 5.9 million shares of common stock for $1.1 billion at a weighted average share price of $189.85, bringing our total year-to-date share repurchases to 8.8 million shares at a weighted average share price of $186.80. As of September 30, 2017, the company had approximately $2.5 billion of board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining, which we intend to utilize over a multiyear period, subject to market conditions.","We ended the third quarter with approximately $2 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $861 million as of the end of the quarter. We used $181 million during the quarter for our cash dividend, and this week our audit committee declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.70 per share to our shareholders.","For the three Rs, our balance sheet continues to reflect the net receivable for risk adjusters, although our current year risk adjuster estimate is not as high as we were previously anticipating, as the claims experience in the Individual businesses is coming in slightly ahead of our expectations.","Now moving to cash flow. For the third quarter 2017, we generated operating cash flow of $2.4 billion, or 3.2 times net income, and on a year-to-date basis operating cash flow was $5.5 billion, or 2.1 times net income.","Our year-to-date cash flow through September 30 continues to be impacted by several timing items that are expected to reverse, including collecting 10 CMS Medicare payments during the first nine months of the year, while only expecting to collect two payments in the fourth quarter; receiving provider capitation pass-through payment funding at the end of the third quarter, which we will be paying to various providers in the fourth quarter. And finally, our original cash flow expectations assume we would make certain Medicaid collar payments in the fourth quarter of 2017, which are now expected to be made in 2018.","After adjusting for these timing items, operating cash flow was still strong. We now expect full year 2017 operating cash flows to be greater than $4 billion, reflecting the high quality of our earnings so far this year.","Turning to our updated 2017 financial outlook. Our 2017 GAAP earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $10.80 to $10.90, and we have increased our adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.25 per share at the midpoint to a range of $11.90 to $12.","Operating revenues are expected to be in the range of $88.5 billion to $89.5 billion. Fully-insured membership is now expected to be in the range of 15.1 million to 15.2 million, and our self-funded membership in the range of 24.9 million to 25 million, as our Medicaid and BlueCard enrollment is coming in lighter than we previously expected. Taken together, we expect our total membership to now be in the range of 40 million to 40.2 million members.","Our 2017 medical loss ratio is now projected to be 86.8%, plus or minus 30 basis points, reflecting better-than-expected performance in our Individual ACA-compliant and Local Group insured businesses. We now expect our SG&A ratio to be at 13.8%, plus or minus 30 basis points, on a GAAP basis, which includes the impact of the Penn Treaty assessments, the 2015 cyber attack litigation settlement, and transaction costs related to the terminated Cigna transaction incurred in the first nine months of 2017.","The increase versus our previous expectations now reflects the impact of higher spending in our growth initiatives, as well as higher incentive compensation due to our better-than-expected performance in 2017. We continue to expect our 2017 Local Group insured medical cost trends to be in the range of 6.5% to 7%, with a bias towards the low end of the range.","Regarding capital deployment, the 2017 outlook includes some additional share repurchase during the beginning of the fourth quarter, bringing us to the higher end of the $1.5 billion to $2 billion range communicated previously.","It is important to note that our outlook does not include any additional transaction or legal cost associated with the terminated Cigna acquisition, beyond those incurred in the first nine months of 2017. Additionally, our outlook also does not include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI.","With that, operator, please open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. We appreciate the commentary directionally on 2018. Now I had a couple of follow-ups. The first one is on the HIP headwinds, $0.20 each, I think, roughly on Commercial and Medicare. Do you see any offsets from utilization into 2018? You have a very good loss ratio in the third quarter, possibly even ex-hurricane it looks really good, given your presence in Texas and Florida. So how should we think about that for 2018?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Hey, Ana. This is John. Thank you for your question. Yeah, the HIP headwind \u2013 make sure I've got your question correct. Yeah, we've actually got a tailwind here in 2017 associated with HIP of about $0.20. That then turns into a little bit more than a $0.40 headwind in 2018. But specifically related to the hurricane, it really didn't impact us that much. We do not have the Blue properties in either Florida or Texas. And the Medicaid business that we had was fairly well-controlled. So the hurricane \u2013 neither of the hurricanes really had a significant financial impact to our results or our outlook.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just want to go to exchanges and your exchange expectations into next year. I guess, how do you approach it in terms of just an overall enrollment? I mean, is it just expectation that things are stable? Do you expect there to be a lot of churn? How committed are you, I guess, to the marketplace in general? I mean, if you expect membership to be down 70%, kind of what's the benefit of sticking it out?","And then just a follow-up around that was just, the executive order, how you see that potentially impacting you? Any thoughts on how the short-term plans \u2013 or how you think association health plans will sort of impact the small group for you? Just trying to get a sense of your position and how disruptive that may or may not be. Thank you.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Ralph, this is John. Why don't I start out by addressing a couple of your financial questions, and then I think Joe will weigh in on some of the strategic elements to your questions.","In terms of the enrollment, as Joe stated, we're expecting our footprint to decrease by about 70% in 2018 from our current 2017 perspective. That's about half of the rating regions that we're currently in, we're getting out of, maybe a little bit more than that. And then for the rating regions that we're staying in, really refining our product designs and our offering in the various meta levels, and that all relates to about a 70% decrease in footprint.","In terms of being committed, it's really related to providing optionality associated with 2019 and where do we want to head in 2019 based on what happens in 2018. It's really premature for us to make a decision on 2019 today. So with that \u2013 well, obviously, we do have the CSR funding issues need to be resolved as well, and that's part of why we're actually pretty comfortable with the significant drop in membership that we have in 2018, given the uncertainty of that area. So a lot needs to be resolved in the next 12 months before there's a final declaration. But we've been in this business since day one, and we think it can be a viable business, assuming that the appropriate legislative and regulatory fixes are in place.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Ralph, good morning. Let me weigh in based on that background. I think that \u2013 well, let me key in on one phrase you used, which is sticking it out. I think, surgically speaking, I've used that term quite often in the last year. I think we've successfully repositioned ourselves in a way that allows us to participate in a more stable environment with respect to the rating regions that we have remained in. Specifically, we will continue to participate in 56 of the 143 rating regions, which, comparatively speaking, we were in virtually all of the rating regions previously.","My sense is that where we are sticking it out, we've got, I think, a reasonably good line of sight to the year. And our expectation is that by the end of 2018, we'll be making the choices that are necessary, considering the advancement of stability, which still there's tremendous amount of lack of clarity in terms of what the future state might look like until further legislation occurs or specificity around certain policy announcements bring clarity.","So long story short, I think, again, surgically we're very well-positioned. I think our pricing is appropriate relative to the hand that's been dealt us. And so, again, I think we have said that we're targeting a low single-digit margin, albeit certainly not at the 3% to 5% target that we continually hope to achieve. We're not there yet. But as John just pointed out, I think we've got the technical and kind of the strategic insights necessary to effectively perform that then we are well-positioned to make the right choices by the end of 2018. So, hopefully, that gives you some line of sight with respect to the ask about our ability to stick it out.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Can you just quantify how much the Medicaid retroactive payment was in the quarter? And, I guess, just clarify, it sounds like you're saying it was in your guidance. This is just the timing of it that was the issue, as far as the guidance goes, that did not contribute to your guidance raise. Is that correct?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. You're correct with your assessment there at the end of your question. We really don't go into exactly how much a retroactive adjustment is. There are retroactive adjustments in the Medicaid arena on really a regular basis. We only spike it out when it's material enough to move the needle. But we have retroactive adjustments every quarter within that \u2013 our block of business, and we have been expecting it all along and we expected it to occur in the fourth quarter. So we actually got it early, which is good news. But it did not change our annual guidance at all.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company","Hi. Two questions. One, prior period development looked pretty significant. Was it heavily weighted towards Government or Commercial? And looking at Commercial earnings, they were down about 15% year-over-year this quarter versus about 10% in the prior quarter. And I think the prior quarter also had some cyber security drain. Is there a comp issue we should be thinking about when looking at this quarter year-over-year on the Commercial operating earnings that I'm maybe forgetting about? Thanks.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Hey, Christine. On the PPIA, I'll say that our reserves have been calculated consistently conservative across all lines of business. And some of the favorable results, I think, reflect the fact that we do have consistently conservative methodologies associated with our reserving patterns. So I really can't say more about a specific line of business after that, but we continue to target a high single-digit margin for adverse deviation. And again, we believe our reserves continue to be consistent and conservative.","In terms of the other questions of year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter, there are several things that are going on. Obviously, the HIP Fee always impacts every analysis, and the fact that we had HIP Fee in 2016, and then not in 2017, and then presumably we'll have it again in 2018, profitability by line of business, all the ratios, all the metrics, are all really non-comparable.","You're correct in terms of compensation expense, and basically our bonus program had issues in 2016, if you recall. We reduced our compensation in 2016 and we have been fortunate enough that we have not had to do that yet in 2017. Hopefully that helps answer your questions.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk about what you are assuming now in updated 2017 guidance for Iowa performance relative to what I think was breakeven expectation in the second half of this year on actuarially sound rates? And then can you tell us why admin fees were down nearly $100 million sequentially in the third quarter? Thanks.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Justin, good morning. This is Joe again. With respect to Iowa, we're continuing negotiations with the state, and there are adjustments that have occurred from time to time and we're in the middle of negotiations as we speak. And there have been some recommendations with respect to those rate adjustments, which we've now \u2013 those adjustments have been put forward to CMS for review and, hopefully, approval.","We've not heard back from CMS as yet and expect at least, hopefully, we'll get something by the end of 2017. But in any event, Iowa is still a work in process, and obviously we're always optimistic that we'll finally be able to work out the situation there. And so, I guess, we'll just have to ask you to kind of stay tuned with respect to the final solution that will be given to us by CMS.","John, do you want to speak to the other matter?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. On the admin fees, there's really nothing within that line item that's problematic or an issue, Justin. It's a good question. The revenues are very much in line with expectations. Our membership is very strong. We did exit the Massachusetts Medicaid ASO arrangement that caused that to drop out and just some other true-ups, but nothing that's really overwhelming associated with that line item.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Management embarked on some fairly significant SG&A streamlining efficiency initiatives going back, I think, as early as maybe 2015. Some of that SG&A savings continued in 2016, obviously, over and above the comp issues that you've already discussed. And then in the press release today you talk about some investments in growth initiatives. I wondered if you could describe where you've been able to take costs out, and then where you are now putting costs into the business, and kind of clarify that those are distinctly different buckets.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah, Dave, great question. This is John. So, happy to respond to that. In terms of where we're taking costs out, we continue to focus on non-value-added services, things that really don't provide a lot of impact to the members and eliminating any duplication of processes and things like that, and just being wise stewards of shareholder dollars and member premiums.","In terms of some growth initiatives, I'll just give you a few examples just to get you comfortable on that, like, for instance, we're really building out our capabilities to enhance our position with the employer group retiree business for Medicare offerings is an example that we see some significant long-term potential, and we really need to enhance our capabilities.","We're focusing on the aging population, and what we mean by that is, let's take a look at the 63 and 64-year-olds, who actually buy insurance through Anthem's Commercial marketplace and get them signed up for a Medicare offering when they age into Medicare. Addition, building out offerings for Specialty, stop loss, integrated healthcare management for ASO customers. All very specific items associated with our growth imperatives and our growth strategies that are clearly different than systems consolidation and elimination of duplicate processes.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah, let me jump in here. Thanks, John, and maybe I can step up a little bit higher just to let you know, just by reminder, back in first quarter communicated to you that we've embarked upon some really detailed review of our SG&A specific to capturing more efficiencies as we service our customers. I challenged our senior leadership at that time to take a really hard look at our relative performance, as well as our cultural characteristics, and we compared ourselves against our competitors and performance variations across our business environment.","We are taking those insights and really translating it to strengthening the assets that we do have, and by way of some specific examples, for instance, our service operation center is really getting streamlined tightly now with respect to how well we service each one of our members with respect to their necessity to have a very efficient and effective engagement with us. So we're taking out costs, but translating that level of performance in a way that leverages, for instance, digitization by way of mobile technologies, by way of other assets that makes it a lot easier for our customers to use our business model.","And so, I guess, that's just one small example, but we've got a really significant commitment now to digitization that gives the kind of leverage we think is necessary to optimize the spend that we've historically placed with respect to eliminating customer abrasion. Again, one small example is producing very meaningful large results for us, in addition to what John said with respect to capital deployment that really is supporting our growth imperatives, which we've mentioned to you. I think there's seven key areas I won't get back into, because we've made that clear to you with respect to where we're putting our commitment going forward with respect to growth. But it's literally just reallocating our cost structure in a way that optimizes our commitment to our customers, as well as our growth imperatives.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Just one quick clarifying, could you remind us of the 1.7 million Individual, how many are ACA-compliant? And then my real question relates to Medicare Advantage. How do you guys think you'll grow organically next year when you think about how your plans stack up against the competition? Do you think you're positioned to take market share or grow more in line with the market? Just wondering how you're thinking about that. Thanks.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. So, Chris, this is John. In terms of the Individual membership, we have about 1.4 million ACA-compliant, and of that 1.4 million ACA-compliant a little less than 1 million of it, maybe a little bit more than 900,000 actually purchased via the exchanges. So that, hopefully, will help you reconcile that.","In terms of where we are in the marketplace we feel very comfortable with our ability to grow. We're going to grow our self-funded membership, we're going to grow our Medicare membership above and beyond the M&A issues that we have in terms of nice Medicare growth associated with the two acquisitions that we've announced here in the last several weeks, continue to grow that. Local Group, we expect the enrollment to be stable in a slightly shrinking marketplace, in terms of the overall market share we expect our market share to increase, so our enrollment will stay stable in that.","So we feel pretty good about where we're positioned and, of course, the Medicaid pipeline continues to be extremely strong in terms of some of the specialized services, whether it's LTSS populations, aged, blind and disabled, various other areas within Medicaid that have not historically been in a Medicaid managed care arrangement that we can provide a lot of savings to the states by providing our support there.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Two-part question. One, I just wanted to make sure I'm following what you had laid out for 2018 correctly. So, midpoint of this year would be $11.95. Midpoint of your long-term guidance 10% growth takes you to $13.15. Back off $0.40 of HIP would be about $12.75 for 2018. So is that \u2013 is there anything wrong with that math?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Gary, your math is very credible and reasonable without \u2013 saying that we, obviously, can't comment on specific point estimates, and I really don't want to go into providing guidance on 2018 yet, since our planning process is not yet complete. But your math is credible.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. I appreciate the comments around the exit in specific exchange counties with lack of clarity, but I wanted to get a little bit more context around the evaluation process and what you perceived as the biggest risk or swing factor. So some of the common characteristics in markets where you decided to stay versus commonalities you saw in markets where you decided to leave. Thank you.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Regarding levels of specificity, obviously, it varied by state, as you would expect. And it's obvious there were multiple factors that we considered when we examined the rating regions. In the main, the instability was a big driver for us, and we tried to map the instability that we could observe and determine how then it would be applied to each one of those rating regions. In some cases, we did feel that exiting was appropriate. Then we began working very carefully with state government to get a better line of sight as to what could occur, and then what adjustments would be necessary to create stability that we needed to stay in the marketplace.","So we did look at trend expectations and we examined various risk profiles that then gave us some line of sight regarding what our position needed to be. We looked at our competitive factors with respect to how they were performing in the markets. And I think in the main, we were able to target some long-term margin expectations based on how we could price, and then what we would sell. And, quite frankly, at the end of the analytics, we then made decisions to stay in certain rating regions and exit others. So I think that that probably pretty much sums up kind of our outlook going rating region by rating region.","CSR subsidy certainly was a very serious consideration. And the fact that we priced accordingly, recognizing that that probably would not \u2013 well, we assumed it would not be in place and that gave us, quite frankly, a line of sight or a commitment to pricing that we felt put us in a good standing with respect to at least being able to price effectively and position ourselves well in the rating regions that we did decide to stay in.","Operator","And our last question this morning comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to sort of maybe take a step back just from an overall strategy perspective and get your views, Joe, in terms of what's the plan for Anthem's growth, right, as you think about sort of expanding markets. And I guess I'm curious on a couple of fronts. The understanding there's timing issues. The cash flow's been really strong, and I think what we're seeing in the last quarter was really a big acceleration in buybacks, largest we've seen probably in three years, three years plus. And then a couple of Florida Medicare Advantage deals. And so I'm just curious, is the strategy here to buy back stock, but look for selective opportunities to expand beyond the 14 markets or do think more of the growth is going to come from your 14 markets? And maybe within that, how do you play with the other Blue's Plans?","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Well, covered a lot of territory there. And I think it's obvious, share buyback is always an element of our capital deployment strategy and we have targets. We've made it very clear what that is year-over-year, and so I think in that regard we're very prudent with respect to how we deploy capital in that regard.","With respect to growth overall, we have made it clear that we do have numerous strategic growth imperatives that actually are playing out quite nicely. As an example, M&A in the Medicare Advantage space, which obviously we were just able to make two very significant announcements in short order in the last few weeks in the Florida marketplace. I think that is going to be a contributor with respect to M&A opportunities.","And, obviously, we are targeting organic growth in the Medicare space. I think looking more long view, as an example in the Medicare space, our PBM opportunity going forward will give us \u2013 albeit it's still a couple years off in terms of 01\/01\/2020, but I think we will be incredibly competitive in the Part D space that we cannot take advantage of today as effectively as we envision after 01\/01\/2020.","I think that the big unknown \u2013 I've already mentioned it \u2013 is the hopeful stability in the Individual marketplace, and that's a story that probably is going to unfold in the coming 12 to 18 months. There are a variety of other opportunities. John already mentioned a few, such as our very heavy focus on Specialty cross-selling to our medical membership, and overall our PBM outlook is very strong, not just Part D, but broadly speaking, it's going to give us a lot of opportunity going forward in terms of capturing share.","John, am I missing anything that maybe...","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","No. Thank you, Joe. I really think there's no way we can oversell the ability for our new PBM contract to really accelerate growth in 2020 and beyond. Every line of business is going to benefit from it significantly. Certainly, in the Part D in the Medicare space, where drug spend is a higher percent of total, it benefits even more, but the large National Accounts, not having carve outs on ASO, really positioning ourselves better for Local Group fully-insured, every line of business benefits from that in 2020 and beyond.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Probably I'm remiss not mentioning other strategic imperatives that we've talked about for growth, like solidifying our Commercial portfolio so that we stem the historic tide with respect to out-migration of certain parts of the business, and we're hopeful to really make that a very strong part of our portfolio going forward. And...","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","And, Joe, maybe...","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","And Medicaid, obviously, is another great example. We keep talking about that pipeline. So, John?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","I would say just to finalize one of Josh's other comments on capital deployment, our share buyback sits consistent with our expectations. We had not done any share buyback for a couple of years while we were going through a large M&A deal that ended up falling through, and so the fact we just came back to a more normalized level of M&A, but really the capital deployment thought process is that we want to be very opportunistic.","We want to be diligent in the effective use of capital. To the extent that there's additional merger and acquisition opportunities, we'll focus the capital on that. To the extent that we think it's a better return of capital to shareholders to do share buyback, we'll do that, and we'll always pay one of the market-leading dividends as well. So there's a lot of different places to go with capital deployment, and any one year is literally just any one year. And we'll make the decisions as the market allows us to.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. I guess, in summary, it's an overarching question. I think it's on everybody's mind, but I can assure you that the team here has well thought out our outlook for next year, and then beyond. That's why we can say that our earnings growth rates, certainly we can hold firm with respect to upper single-digit and low-double digit outlook.","And just in summary, I can tell you our Government business is strong. Our Commercial business is continually repositioning and strengthening in many, many ways. And then the core element of performance of the company around SG&A controls, our capital deployment strategies, as John just pointed out, and another sort of driver is our PBM outlook in terms of repricing opportunities.","So I think your question really allowed us to give you kind of a summary statement about the entirety of our performance outlook and the commitment that management has made to the growth agenda for this company. I think the proof points are there and we're very excited about the potential for the company going forward.","Operator","And thank you. I'd now like to turn the conference back to company management with the company's closing comments.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Great. Thank you for all your questions. As always, they are very insightful and very probing, and I'm glad we're able to give you line of sight to our directions going forward. As you know, as a company, we are committed to confronting our healthcare system's challenges and we're focused on expanding access to high-quality, affordable healthcare for our customers. I have to again underscore, thanks to all of our associates for their continued commitment to serving over 40 million members every day.

Welcome to the Anthem Third Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management.","Chris Rigg - Anthem, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to Anthem's third quarter 2018 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division.","Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our third quarter financial results, followed by commentary around our focus on execution and our enterprise-wide growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail and go over our updated 2018 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com.","We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and our quarterly filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Gail.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Anthem's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Today, we reported third quarter 2018 GAAP earnings per share of $3.62 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.81, reflecting improved execution across our enterprise and growing momentum within our businesses.","Anthem's third quarter operating revenue grew 4% over the prior-year quarter to $23 billion. Strong growth in our Government Business more than offset the planned reduction in our Individual business. Administrative fees and other revenue increased more than 15% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting increased sales of our Specialty products, clinical engagement programs, and growth of fee-based membership. Third quarter membership met expectations, and we expect growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter.","Our third quarter medical cost performance was strong and reflects the impact of our value-based integrated care arrangement. Anthem's Whole Health Connection, which delivers clinical integration across our medical and Specialty product is closing gaps in care and reducing costs. Over the last year alone, this program has helped identify over 30,000 diabetic through vision exams.","Our 2018 adjusted earnings per share outlook is now greater than $15.60, reflecting a 30% increase from 2017. Our revised 2018 guidance is a direct result of the enterprise-wide changes we made to improve execution, including sales force automation, the introduction of new clinical programs, and further scaling of existing assets like CareMore. We believe the investments and cultural changes we've implemented in 2018 provide a solid foundation for growth in 2019 and beyond.","We're focused on creating innovative, meaningful, and cost-effective healthcare solutions for consumers. Our collaboration with Walmart, launching in January of 2019, gives our Medicare Advantage member the flexibility to use their over-the-counter plan allowances to purchase medications and health-related items from Walmart's 4,700 stores and online. Today, more than 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, and our partnership demonstrates our commitment to driving convenient, affordable access to healthcare for our seniors.","Our 2019 Medicare Advantage plan design feature competitive medical and pharmacy benefits and include significant enhancements to ancillary benefits designed to address whole person care. Overall, our 2019 Medicare Advantage offering position us well for both mid-double digit growth and stable margins.","As we highlighted on the second quarter earnings call, momentum in our group Medicare Advantage business is accelerating, and we now expect total membership to exceed 150,000 in the first quarter of 2019. Our success in winning business is a result of our deep penetration in the commercial market, industry-leading Blue brand, and strong consumer relationships. As the trusted brand for many of the largest commercial accounts, we benefit from a captive new business pipeline and are uniquely-positioned for multiyear growth in the group Medicare segment.","We're disappointed with the Star Quality rating scores that were recently announced by CMS, which will impact payments in 2020. As part of our overall Medicare Advantage Star Strategy, we're deploying incremental capital to improve clinical quality, pharmacy and medication management, and the member experience. We believe these steps will lead to an improved Stars outcome for the 2021 payment year.","In the Medicaid segment, our partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield (sic) [Blue Cross and Blue Shield] (06:04) in Minnesota is expected to go live in December and will serve approximately 365,000 Medicaid and dual eligible members. In addition, the Virginia Medicaid expansion remains on track to commence in the first quarter of 2019 and we continue to expect to serve our pro rata share of the estimated 400,000 eligible individuals.","Looking ahead to 2019 and beyond our CareMore business is an important clinical differentiator as we target growth in more medically-complex patients. CareMore's Medicaid care delivery program integrates medical and behavioral with a focus on whole person care, leading to significantly improved quality and affordability of care. As a result of the CareMore model, we estimate our members in Tennessee, for example, spend at least 10% fewer days in the hospital, reported 20% fewer ER visits, and 25% fewer specialist visits.","In our Commercial business, our pricing strategies remain disciplined and, overall, we believe our markets are rational. Our strategic focus is to improve the consumer experience for our members by delivering end-to-end solutions that address the physical, emotional, spiritual, social, and financial dimensions of wellbeing. We've improved sales effectiveness and strengthened how we work with our distribution partners through investments in our front-end broker portal and CRM technology.","We've simplified our technology environment and added valuable digital capabilities that make it easier for our broker partners to do business with Anthem. Our new integrated digital platform equips our distribution partners with the necessary tools to seamlessly sell, renew, and monitor their medical and Specialty business with Anthem.","We are focused on integrating products and services with solutions that enable ease-of-use and greater engagement. The recent launch of Anthem Act Wise is expected to accelerate growth on our consumer-directed segment. The Act Wise tool simplifies health care by allowing members to manage medical and wellbeing benefits through a single interface. We anticipate greater than 800,000 subscribers and 9,000 employer groups will utilize Act Wise by early 2019.","We've also standardized our clinical and value-based programs with predefined combinations of offerings. These packages make it easier for employers to purchase the suite of products most relevant to their employee population. The packages will be priced lower than if purchased separately and will generate a strong return for employers with superior medical cost savings. And all of this will be integrated and available on our digital consumer engagement platform, Anthem Engage.","Since its launch in the first quarter of this year, we've doubled the number of members using Anthem Engage. By leveraging Engage, we are able to deliver a fully-integrated suite of products, including Anthem Health Guide, Wellbeing Coach, and other healthcare solutions.","LiveHealth Online, our telehealth solution, saves consumers time and drives affordability by redirecting care to the appropriate setting. Our data shows 86% of LiveHealth Online users, chose lower class health care settings, generating an average savings of $200 per health episode. The steps we've taken to improve sales execution and enhance the competitiveness of our product designs and consumer engagement tools are resonating and will drive growth in our Commercial group business in 2019. Our recently launched Digital Lifestyle Management program and Total Health Total You clinical package are distinctive offerings powered by AI and deep analytics that enable real-time referrals to disease and complex case management resources.","Our new PBM, IngenioRx, remains on track to launch January 1, 2020. The launch of our PBM remains a key initiative with an experienced, dedicated transition team fully focused on delivering not just the standup of IngenioRx but also a seamless execution for our customers and members. To-date, we've built and tested thousands of our benefit plans and set up our required technology environments. The build out of our customer service center is ongoing and will be up and running by mid-2019.","Overall, I am very pleased with our progress to-date. We continue to expect IngenioRx to deliver at least $4 billion of gross pharmacy savings annually once our transition has been completed. The vast majority of these savings will flow through to our customers in the form of more affordable healthcare, and at least 20% of this value will accrue to our shareholders.","I will now pass the call over to John for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial performance before concluding our prepared remarks with an initial assessment of 2019.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As Gail stated, we reported strong third quarter financial results with adjusted earnings per share increasing 44% year-over-year to $3.81. Adjusted net income was $1 billion in the quarter, up 43% over the prior year.","Operating revenue in the third quarter of 2018 was $23 billion, an increase of 4% versus the prior year quarter. The growth in operating revenue reflects strong organic growth in our Medicare and fee-based businesses, as well as the acquisitions of HealthSun and America's 1st Choice, among other factors. The revenue growth in the quarter comes despite our voluntary decision to reduce our individual ACA footprint, which has resulted in a 56% decline in our individual membership since the end of 2017.","Medical membership was stable at 39.5 million members, and we have maintained our year-end guidance range of 39.9 million to 40.1 million members. Our medical cost ratio in the third quarter was 84.8%, lower than expected and down 220 basis points from the prior-year quarter and 60 basis points year-to-year when normalized for the health insurer fee.","We are reaffirming our 5.5% to 6.5% Local Group medical cost trend with an expectation of being slightly below the midpoint. Further, we have reduced our medical loss ratio guidance range by 20 basis points at the midpoint to 84.2%. Our SG&A ratio was 15.4%, striking a strategic balance between cost discipline and investments we are making in systems modernization, digital, and clinical product capabilities. Our SG&A guidance range for 2018 is unchanged at 15.4%, plus or minus 30 basis points.","Our balance sheet remains strong with our debt to cap ratio at 40% at the end of the quarter, in line with our targeted range. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $259 per share, totaling approximately $397 million.","Operating cash flow, which is in line with our expectations, was $607 million in the quarter resulting in operating cash flow of $3.4 billion or 1 times net income for the first nine months of the year. We continue to expect operating cash flow to exceed $4 billion for all of 2018.","Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22. 9%. As anticipated, our effective tax rate decreased in the third quarter, and full year 2018 guidance range is unchanged at 26.5% to 27.5%. As a reminder, due to the nondeductible nature of the health insurer fee, higher-than-expected operating gains skews our tax rate lower.","Our third quarter results reflect stronger-than-anticipated growth in operating gain and we expect to maintain our momentum for the balance of the year. As a result, we now expect our 2018 adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $15.60.","I will now pass the call back over to Gail.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thanks, John. We're entering 2019 in a position of strength. As an organization, we have made significant improvements over the last year, and we expect to sustain our enterprise-wide momentum in 2019 as a result of recent and ongoing investments. We intend to offer a much more detailed 2019 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call, but I do want to highlight several factors which will impact our financial performance next year.","Our initial view of 2019 contemplates both manageable challenges and growth opportunities. Key headwinds from this distance include ongoing regulatory uncertainty related to the health insurer fee, the expected dilution from new contracts in Medicaid and group Medicare, and ongoing investments to drive and accelerate future revenue growth.","Tailwinds include growth in our Medicare Advantage, Commercial, and fee-based businesses, increased accretion from 2018 capital deployment, and the timing benefit of the health insurance fee. Taken together and, in the context of our revised 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance, the current 2019 consensus is slightly below our core long-term high-single to low double-digit EPS growth target.","And with that, operator, we'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes, good morning. So, first question is going to be on outlook and I'm interested in both 2019 and then as you're thinking about the PBM impacts for 2020. Could you just give a little color as to what sort of the magnitude of any as of headwinds associated with the PBM in 2019; are you pricing in PBM savings in advance of achieving them in 2020?","And then as you're thinking of the PBM in 2020 and beyond, should we be thinking about the 2020 being a partial year of benefit and then 2021 being a full year, or will we get all that benefit in 2020?","[Technical Difficulty] (18:20-20:09)","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen please standby. All right, sir, you're back on. Please go ahead.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Welcome back, and this is Gail Boudreaux, sorry. We had some technical difficulties with our call. Lance let me address your question. I wanted to \u2013 there are a number of components in there and I will first address the 2019 consensus and how we're exiting 2018. And then I'll ask John Gallina to share with you his commentary around the PBM.","First, in terms of 2018, overall, we feel very positive about our business and we see a lot of momentum. As we exit 2018, we've increased our guidance by $0.20 to $15.60, and we see growth strengthening based on the initiatives that we put in place across our businesses. For 2019, we will provide much more detailed guidance at our fourth quarter call, and I think it's a bit premature at this stage to go into some of the other details.","But, again, looking at the guidance from 2018, we do \u2013 have given you long-term EPS growth guidance of high-single to low double-digit, and we do see that the consensus for 2019 does appear light given that. We certainly aspire always to do more, as I shared on other calls, but overall we feel that the components within our business are strong and we see momentum growing.","I'm going to ask John specifically to address your question around the PBM and how that impacts 2019.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, Gail, and good morning, Lance. I appreciate the question. Related to the PBM, we're under contract with ESI through 12\/31\/2019. We'll obviously fulfill contractual commitments as we expect ESI to fulfill their contractual commitments. And then we'll convert over in 2020. We've talked about $4 billion of savings related to improved pricing and that more than 20% of that being delivered to shareholders and almost 80% going back into more affordable healthcare premiums to our members and our customers.","Related to the 2020 savings, the $4 billion is a run rate number. And so we will convert our membership throughout 2020. 2020 should be viewed as a partial year, the way that you asked the question, and we expect the conversion fully completed and be 100% migrated on the new platform no later than January 1, 2021. So, partial year for 2020.","Now the other part of your question was related to our 2019 pricing strategies and what headwinds we might have associated with that or other limitation or integration costs. I'll just say that, as Gail has reaffirmed the consensus outlook out there is a little bit light right now and it certainly includes all aspects of that.","We've stated previously that the impact on Anthem's financial statements associated with the migration would be minimal in 2018 and 2019. There was not a significant one-time headwind that we had baked in and continue to believe that. And then in terms of future pricing, very minimally in 2019, but anything that has happened is already fully reflected in Gail's commentary associated with our 2019 expectations.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, just in the Government business you said in the press release there were some rising medical costs in Medicaid. Just curious if there's more color around what's going on there, whether you could talk about that either categorically and also do you view that as kind of more temporary? I just want to get your thoughts around that disclosure in the press release. Thanks.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Well, thank you very much for the question. Overall, we're very pleased \u2013 let me start with where I answered my last question, too. Overall, we're very pleased with the portfolio of our businesses. If you look at our performance year-to-date particularly in our Government business and Medicaid, we feel very good about our business and it's in line with our expectations for the full year.","In Medicaid, as is typical with this business, there's always out-of-period adjustments, so I wouldn't read too much into the quarter-over-quarter comparisons for our Government business. On a year-to-date, again, overall Medicare and Medicaid are performing solidly within our target margins. Keep in mind too that we improved our MLR guidance by 20 basis points, which encompasses all of our businesses.","So overall, we feel these businesses are performing within expectations and feel good about the full-year outlook and certainly the year-to-date performance.","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, everybody. Maybe \u2013 I know, Gail, earlier in the year in some of the calls you've laid out some of the long-term initiatives that you were pursuing and you mentioned some of it a little bit in the prepared remarks, but I'll see if there's any further update on cross-selling opportunities in the self-funded business and what you're seeing there. Any further discussions with new collaborations with Blues? And then I think there was also discussion about investments in things like consumer facing and general data analytics capabilities. So if there's any update on those or the other initiatives you've laid out, love to hear them.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Great. Thank you A. J. Covered a number of things, as I think I've shared on each of these quarterly calls, focus on a couple of key areas. One, improving performance execution across our enterprise and I think that the changes we've made in sort of structure as well as performance and discipline across our culture, we're starting to see some of the early results of that across our businesses, so I feel really positive about that.","The second major area of emphasis has been around growth. Coming to Anthem, I felt that we have some very strong assets across all of our businesses, and growth has been a particular focus. And I'm going to start on some of the places that we've invested in, then I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian who leads our Commercial business to share with you some of the more specific details.","I'll start first on sort of the investments. We have been investing and you probably saw our recent announcement around digital capabilities, consolidation and migration of our systems which we think will, over the next several years, improve our operating environment.","Artificial intelligence capabilities, we're building a team there that allows us to actually work both in the clinical predictive place and we've been embedding those in some of the products that I shared with you earlier that help our clients sooner identify individuals with complex conditions. We think that there's a lot of potential in that space because of the population we serve both in Commercial and the Government business, and that's an area of long-term growth.","And again, we've been investing in making sure that our product capabilities are strong. We came into this year a little bit disappointed about the positioning of products. We've spent a lot of time focused on those products in our Commercial business and the cross-sell opportunities inside of our Specialty business. You saw on our uptick in revenue in the quarter that we had some nice pull-through of Specialty penetration as well as clinical bias. And that's an area of focus where we think we've got additional growth opportunity.","With that, I'm going to ask Pete to just share some of the initiatives that he's in put place in the Commercial business and some of the impact that that's already having.","Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Gail, and thanks, A.J., for the question. I think I'll just sort of tick through some of the things that I've mentioned over the last couple of quarters and talk to you about progress. But generally speaking I think we're very encouraged by the progress we're making in the Commercial business.","First I'll start with talent; really encouraged by the talent that we're attracting into the company both with respect to my team as well as out in the field. Number two, we've talked a lot about our segment strategy structure. So deploying standardization across all 14 states as well as building in best practices, and we continue to see that build out and we continue to see great progress in that regard.","I've also talked about Centers of Excellence and making investments in things like sales force effectiveness, centralizing underwriting so we could be a lot smarter and quicker with respect to our decision-making around underwriting, and then product development and making sure that we have the right products in the marketplace and we're being as agile as we can with respect to selling those.","I've also talked about our network development \u2013 provider network development strategies and making sure that we have high-performing networks. We're launching across the company strategies like cooperative care in which we're focused on the highest-quality providers at the best costs and we're looking then to match those networks with the most effective products, and we're seeing progress with regard to that. And then as Gail talked about how we package our products, making sure that we have clinical packages and other consumer engagement tools that are really effective in the marketplace.","And then finally, as we face the market in terms of how we engage with our distribution, our brokers, I'm really encouraged by the progress we're making. We are now with respect to quotes doing things on a digital basis as well as with respect to enrollment. So we're seeing electronic enrollment occur in the marketplace. And that all is happening in a much more streamlined fashion as we move forward.","That is translating, as Gail said, into growth. We're encouraged by what's happening quarter-over-quarter from a membership perspective, we see nice improvement in our local market growth, and we are cautiously optimistic with respect to the momentum that's creating going into 2019 and the first quarter of 2019.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thanks, Pete. And as you can see, we've got a lot of initiatives underway and we think that they're going to begin to build momentum and certainly are optimistic for 2019 really seeing the impact of that.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning. If I could just follow-up on Commercial as far as National Accounts goes and some of the trends we're seeing like direct-to-provider contracting where GM is doing something directly with Henry Ford and the Blue Cross is more a TPA here. You talked about the Castlight platform with member engagement, it's on 800,000 members; Samsung, Amwell, and the like. What exactly can Anthem do here and is doing in partnership with the Blues more broadly to create a Blue platform, BlueCard and beyond, that can satisfy self-insured employers and moving away from health plans at this point?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Well, thanks for the question. Very comprehensive question, Ana. I will try to hit on each of the \u2013 let me start first with the National Account marketplace which you began your question with. Overall, we feel actually quite positive about the initiatives in place in that marketplace. Pete touched on a couple of those.","One, the networks that we're putting in place around more value-based care. As you know, we have a cost advantage across our Blue Cross and Blue Shield system, and we are moving strongly to make sure that we also have integrated value-based arrangements that we can share with our National Accounts. And so, that's an initiative that we've been working on across the system and it's beginning to resonate.","Our overall performance for National Accounts, we're coming to the close of the season for 2019, and this year was an interesting year in that it was more about incumbency, but overall we do expect to grow in that marketplace, and we did see a number of accounts waiting for 2020 in terms of some of the larger accounts on their bid process. We will expect, and we do believe that our launch of IngenioRx there is a huge positive for us in that market.","But your broader question around the Blue Cross Blue Shield partnerships and opportunity, that has been a priority of mine. We have over 107 million people across the Blue Cross and Blue Shield system that we serve, one in three Americans. One of the strongest brands. And we, I think have an opportunity to work collaboratively across the system to improve the affordability and access to healthcare.","The Engage platform for us is somewhat unique in that we have fully integrated that platform into our consumer experience and our digital capabilities, as well as our clinical program. So it's not just a platform; it's a stand-alone. And I think what that offers an opportunity to others who want to join us in partnership is being able to share that kind of deep integration. It's truly an opportunity.","We have worked with several Blue partners on our service model and engaging some of our clinical programs through our CareMore subsidiary as well as through some of the other work we do. So we're already doing that. We're doing it in Medicaid for example in our partnership. But back to your question, we do see a lot of opportunity and we're very focused on being a good partner in the system, and we think that the capabilities that we bring are very differentiating because of the local market share depth plus our partnership.","And let me maybe ask Pete to give a couple more comments, maybe about how the National Account is playing out and specifically about the direct contracting.","Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah, no, I would agree with everything that Gail said. We're very encouraged by what's happening. I mean, it's nice to see that year-over-year we will see growth. In a year of incumbency, we will see growth in the National business from 2018 to 2019.","And just to extenuate a point that Gail made around collaboration and cooperation with the Blues; I am really encouraged by the conversations that are going on with the Blues on a national basis with respect to construction and high-performing networks. We are locking arms and making sure that we're building networks on a unified basis so that consumers can have a real, consistent experience across the board.","And then in terms of our capabilities, like Gail said, our theme is really around integration and the consumer experience and making sure that there's an ease-of-use with our customers. So we're really encouraged by that. We're making a lot of investment in that regard. A lot of our peers and competitors are working in a fragmented environment. And so, bringing all these tools and capabilities together in an integrated way, I think, is a meaningful difference.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just have a couple follow-ups here. First, there's been a lot of focus on your Medicaid comments in the press release on higher medical costs and you mentioned out-of-period adjustments, Gail, earlier in the call. So, can you give us more detail here on what occurred in the quarter?","And then on guidance, appreciate the commentary, but in terms of how we should think about 2019, is it reasonable to think about 2019 as a combination of the high single-digit to low double-digit growth coupled with, I think you talked about $0.60 of HIF timing benefit previously. Is that kind of a reasonable framework? Thanks.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thanks, Justin. First of all, in terms Medicaid, I guess, again, what I would say as you think about that, it's pretty typically in the Medicaid business to have out-of-period adjustments. So, as you look at our full year, it's really more about the timing and we expect that timing to normalize. We've got very strong nine months performance, and we expect to see continued ongoing strong performance for the full year. So, overall, that was really what I meant in comments around Medicaid.","I'm going to ask John to comment a little bit more, I think, about your 2019 earnings per share guidance, but again, we're not getting into detailed guidance at this stage and I'll go back to my prepared comments, but may be John can add some commentary.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Sure. Thanks. Good morning, Justin, and thanks for the question. In terms of 2019, first, I'll address the HIF fee headwind that were in this year. It's about $0.40 this year associated with our current operations, and the other $0.20 is a bit more fungible. So, I would say that the way that you're approaching it from a modeling perspective, I think the $0.40 is a very fair and appropriate adjustment to make as a starting point. And then, yeah, we are very much looking at a high-single to low double-digit growth rate associated with that starting point.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. In Medicaid, wondered if you could talk about the adequacy of the rate increase in August in Iowa; does that kind of get your plan there in Medicaid Iowa to a more normal margin? And then in Texas, if you could talk about your confidence or comfort with your positioning relative to re-procurement in Texas? Thanks.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Well, in terms of sort of specific states, we really don't comment on overall specific state situations, and so I won't go into any state-specific situations. Overall though, again, as we think of our guidance in 2018, we feel that our Medicaid position is actually \u2013 we have a very strong Medicaid platform and it's performing within our target margin. So, overall, we feel comfortable about our portfolio. We have over 22 states, so we think about our business as a complete portfolio.","In terms of procurements, maybe I'll ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our Government business, maybe just to comment a little bit about pipeline and what's happening in our various opportunities.","Felicia F. Norwood - Anthem, Inc.","Good morning and thank you. Certainly with respect to Texas, as you know, the state cancelled and we issued the Texas procurement. We are an incumbent today and we certainly would expect to bid on that procurement as we move forward that's due this month. When we take a look at the overall Medicaid pipeline, it remains very robust. We have had a very strong success rate in terms of winning procurements, and we are confident of our ability to continue to maintain that trajectory as we go forward.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes. Thank you. You touched on the health insurer fee as a key uncertainty, I supposed, looking beyond 2019. If you don't mind sharing with us, what are the key milestones that you're looking to in terms of activity, when you think that might happen in Congress in terms of a further suspension or perhaps permanent elimination of the fee?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Matt. I'm not quite sure how to respond only in the sense that I really don't have a great crystal ball as to the timing of when those types of things are happening. Obviously, we feel very strongly that affordability in the marketplace and stability is really important.","We appreciate the suspension for 2019 and feel that certainly it's good for employers and for the marketplace, and it's something that we are strongly advocating that becomes a permanent reduction in the health insurer fee, that that goes away.","So I don't have any great insight into timing. It's something that we're constantly sort of sharing our views on and working on the Hill, et cetera, and with the administration on. So other than that, not a whole lot of specifics there to provide.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Still struggling, I guess, to understand why you called out Medicaid, and I guess just looking in context of the Government segment operating gain this quarter, 60% or 70% growth sort of through the first half of the year and then a 3% growth number this year. So it looks like a relatively big change or at least a decent number in there.","So maybe you could just help us what exactly was this out-of-period? Why should we understand that not to be a go-forward issue? If you could just contain to a specific state or a specific program, et cetera, I think that'd be helpful.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Josh. This is John. Thank you for the question and I appreciate the opportunity to try to clarify whatever misunderstanding is out there. The way that the Medicaid business just operates in general is there are always out-of-period adjustments, and there are always timing issues that can skew quarter-over-quarter results.","Quite honestly, sometimes it can be misleading to look at just a quarter-over-quarter result without understanding all the issues, and you really have to look at out-of-period that occurred in the third quarter 2017 as well as out-of-period that occurred in 2018, and unfortunately, we're not going to go through the list of the 22 states and which ones may have had an out-of-period or which ones didn't.","But what I would ask you to do is to look at the year-to-date performance as well as our annual expectations and know that our Government business in total, as Gail said, is within our targeted operating gain ranges. We believe that both Medicaid and Medicare are operating very well and within our expectations, and we're very, very satisfied with the performance and think we have some nice momentum heading into 2019.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. So just want to confirm I guess one thing and then a follow-up. So when guys look at your results this quarter from your perspective MLR is coming in better and the tax rate looks a little bit lower just because the operating income gain is higher and that just mathematically brings down the tax rate, so just want to confirm that. But then to the extent that cost trend is coming in better, can you give some color on what is coming in a little bit better and by product, is it Commercial, is it Medicare? How should we think about that?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Sure. On the tax, you're exactly correct that as we perform better in our core operations that our tax rate will be lowered mathematically, given the fact that the health insurer fee is a fixed number in the calculation. In addition, there were a couple of small true-ups associated with the 2017 tax return filing that also benefited.","But when you look at the outperformance in the quarter, the outperformance in the quarter was driven both by strong operations as well as by the small true-ups from the third quarter \u2013 I'm sorry from the 2017 tax return we did in the third quarter. So associated with that, we're very bullish, that's one of the reasons we increased our guidance by $0.20 for the year.","And then the other part of your question was, we lowered our medical loss ratio by 20 basis points. It's really \u2013 it's the continued strengthen in our clinical programs, continued strong momentum in that area. Our medical cost trend which is based on our Commercial group, we built a bias to slightly below the midpoint. And all those things combined, are giving us the comfort to reduce our medical loss ratio guidance for the rest of the year.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. Gail, you spent a bit of the time in a question here talking about your consumer-facing platform, and just a follow-up on some of your comments. You talked earlier about with Engage doubling the number of members. Can you talk about sort of penetration into the client base.","You mentioned 800,000 members expected by early next year. What do you think is the realistic target part of your market to have that platform facing? And then, as you talk about the investments that you're making in the consumer experience, how far along are you, would you say, in terms of where you want to be ultimately in these regards? Thanks.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Sure. I'll start and then I'll also ask Pete to give a little bit more color. In terms of our capabilities, I think we're pretty far along. We have been investing in those capabilities the last years. We accelerated those investments this year. And when you think about Anthem Engage, that's just one component of a complete digital platform and an AI platform that we're building.","We launched Anthem Engage in January; have seen some very strong uptick, mostly in our large self-insured customers and we doubled it which was our goal. So I think that there's a significant penetration opportunity there, but that's just, again, one piece. LiveHealth Online is another really interesting offering where we have several \u2013 close to several million members in that opportunity. Again, a fairly recent launch. All of those have very strong Net Promoter Scores.","But I also like to look at not just our consumer engagement, but our clinical programs. Our clinical programs are also powered by digital and we're using AI to help us identify patients sooner in the process and we think significantly sooner, almost six months in some instances, to get them into our complex case management programs, as well as to integrate all of their wellbeing aspects.","The last piece that I wanted to just touch on is Anthem Whole Health Connection. I shared a little bit about that in my prepared remarks, but that's a pretty interesting combination of not just technology, but also integration where we're really taking our vision, our dental, our pharmacy, our medical, and our disability and our both clinical and our claims information and connecting them with the way we work with our care providers in the community to access and understand gaps in care and coordinate care across the continuum, and we're identifying interrelationships and issues much earlier.","And the reason that works for us, again, is because we have the digital capability, but also we have the deep market penetration and market share where we have significant number of patients in a physician's office, in a dentist's office, in our local markets.","So overall what I would say is we are making significant investments around digital, AI. We've hired a team that's working on that, that we think will help accelerate that. We did a recent press release, I think you saw some information about that, but we also think we need to work in partnerships. So we've got a number of partners that \u2013 we're also trying things like doc.ai. We announced our relationship with them because we think that it's this interconnectedness across the system that's going to not just advance our capabilities but also leapfrog them.","But maybe I'll ask Pete to just share a little bit about how the market \u2013 how this is resonating in the market because I think that was sort of the core of your question and the potential it had.","Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's a great question, Charles. And I think Gail really covered the gamut. I would think of Engage as our consumer engagement platform and everything we're doing attempting to integrate ultimately into the user experience through Engage.","Just to give you some facts; as of October, 1.6 million members today in Engage. We're finding that 30% of our users are viewing gaps in care, 60% of our users are accessing benefits and health management programs. So we're seeing really good engagement. Our NPS score associated with Engage is around a 70, so we feel really good about the use there. But let me give you a specific example of how we're trying to differentiate ourselves from an integration perspective.","So you had asked question about consumer-directed health plans and how we're differentiating ourselves, we call that Anthem Applives. (49:44) And so consumer-directed health plans are not new, we know that. We have about 4.5 million customers in that today but what we're doing that's different is we're bringing together disparate services \u2013 so think about all financial services associated with a consumer-directed health plan, your FSA, your HSA, et cetera, specialty products that you may have or medical products \u2013 and we're ultimately integrating all of those into one unified consumer experience and ultimately they'll experience that through our Anthem Engage tools.","So when we talked about uptake in Applives (50:22) as we talk about expecting over 800,000 subscribers and ultimately over 9,000 employers taking advantage of our new Anthem Applives (50:33) technology. But that's how we're really differentiating ourselves; creating that integrated environment versus a fragmented experience that folks may have today with a consumer-directed health plan.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you very much. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to be clear on guidance again. I'm seeing consensus EPS growth of 10.7%, so it seems sort of in line with commentary of high single, low double. So maybe just help us on the line item that you're comparing to and what consensus growth is there. And just staying on the guidance, you talked about headwinds and you specifically you called out sort of dilution on Medicare and Medicaid. Hoping you can kind of flesh that out as we think about the ramp of the margin with so much group MA coming off. Thanks.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Ralph. Good morning. Thank you for the question. Now in terms of guidance in the high single and the low double digit growth rate that we've previously have expressed I think the real question is off of what starting point.","And we raised guidance today from $15.40 to greater than $15.60. And then as a previous question had referred to is how the HIF fee is factoring into that, the fact that we have a HIF fee this year, we have about a $0.40 headwind associated with that in our 2018 results and how to factor that into the 2019 jump-off point. And I think really the math on that is to take our earnings and add the $0.40 headwind back in and then think through our long-term growth rate from that perspective.","In terms of the other headwinds\/tailwinds, I mean the fact that we have a headwind for growth in group MA and group Medicaid is actually a very good thing, because they both revolve around the word growth. So say we're growing those lines of business which we believe will be very profitable for us over the long-term. We don't specifically size the individual items on a line item by line item basis, but we're very bullish with the membership growth and very bullish with what the long-term aspects of that will provide for the company.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thanks, John. And also I'll just add that those components have been factored into the outlook that we provided. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the color this morning. I guess, just wanted to follow up on the commentary around the cost trend. So is it also fair to read the change to the Local Group cost trend outlook as suggestive of trend having maybe decelerated more recently? And perhaps maybe you can just give us a flavor for how much of the favorability this year is the initiatives versus sort of the natural patterns you're seeing, and maybe comment on how utilization is trending within that, that'd be great. Thank you.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Thanks, Steve. Thank you for the question. Yeah, we are very bullish on our cost trend and as I had stated in the prepared comments that we are going slightly below the midpoint of the trend, and I think that's very meaningful associated with being able to reduce our medical loss ratio guidance for the fourth quarter by 20 basis points.","In terms of utilization versus pricing, yeah, we're pretty much consistent with what most others in the industry are is that somewhere between two-thirds and 80% of the increase is price and unit cost and then the rest is utilization. We continue to work very hard on utilization ensuring that we have appropriate care and that the experience that our members have that they're getting the right care in the right place at the right time. We're seeing reductions in inpatient bed days as an example of one of the initiatives that's going very well and helping direct more care to lower cost out-patient settings.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Let me also add to John's comment and your specific question about is this sort of natural trend or what's occurring. I mean, we have done a lot in our marketplace around value-based care; clinical program; moving, as John said, to appropriate place of service. So there's a lot of activity that goes on each and every year and so to parse that out, but clearly the biggest driver of trend historically and continues to be unit cost pressure in the system.","We have seen obviously very positive trends over \u2013 inpatient utilization continues to go down and we continue to stay very focused on specialty pharma. That's an area of intense focus and we're excited about the ability actually going forward in IngenioRx to continue to manage it. So overall I don't think you really parse the pieces but we are doing a lot in our markets around value-based care moving more \u2013 and we have over 60% today under those arrangements moving to much stronger forms of risk share and risk-taking.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Two-part question, one on group MA, you talked about 150,000 enrollments for the first quarter. I think that's up from just a little under 60,000 currently, and my question was, is that being driven by one large contract win or several? And is the catalyst for that the multi-state Blue platform?","And then second part of the question is just a cash flow question for John. Cash flow has been weaker. I understand some of the timing issues on CMS payments et cetera and the exit of the exchanges having an impact, but the one line that I'm a little confused by is I think premium receivables has been $700 million bad guy year-to-date on cash flow and just wanted to understand the source of that growth a little bit.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Gary, let me take the first part of your question around group MA and then I'll have John address the cash flow questions that you raised. First, thanks for the question on group MA. As you've heard, we're very bullish about the opportunity of group Medicare Advantage, and it's a business that we've gotten very serious about and brought in a dedicated team and resources.","Specifically to your question, though, we have broad-based growth, so we're not looking at any single client driving this into 2018. But what is unique I think about our opportunity is we have a very attractive commercial book that is an inherently captive pipeline of members that are Medicare-eligible both through our \u2013 members that are receiving benefits today through RAP products, existing commercial accounts that are using the MA products from our competitors as well as agents, and we have a very robust pipeline.","So, we feel very safe in the numbers that we shared with you this morning and we see a pretty significant pipeline going forward. The Blue Cross Blue Shield partnerships absolutely are an opportunity for us as well going forward. I think the overall system recognizes the value. These are Commercial members that we have had through their lifetime and it's important that we keep them. So I think you hit on another really important part of our strategy and why we're very bullish about group Medicare Advantage going forward.","So, with that, I'll ask John to address your cash flow question.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you and good morning, Gary. On cash flow, there are several different moving pieces as you have identified, I think you called out one of significant factors already and that is with our strategic decision to reduce our footprint in the individual ACA marketplace. We obviously had payments of run out of claims and the reserves that existed on that business at 12\/31\/2017, and so that would've lowered our cash flow expectations for the year. That was obviously all part of our guidance and we knew that was coming but it does actually reduce the cash flow.","Even with that, we have a very strong cash flow expectation of 1 times net income. The piece on the premium receivables is really focused primarily on a lot of Medicaid and Medicaid states paying us one month in arrears and that's driving the receivable balance a little bit higher and, yeah, we think it's still obviously very collectible. They're good receivables; it's just a bit of a slowdown of the cash flow associated with having some states having us a month in arrears versus getting paid on a more timely basis.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","We have time for one for question. So next question, please.","Operator","Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much for squeezing me in here at the end. My question \u2013 you covered rest of this year and 2019 pretty well, but I'd like to talk about 2020 and a couple of big changes there. First, the PBM, have you decided whether you're going to migrate the Medicare business or the Commercial business first because that matters in terms of when you get the cost savings? And then President Trump's HRA changes, how do you feel that's going to impact your Commercial business?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Peter. First, as I shared on the call \u2013 or in my prepared remarks rather, we have a very detailed schedule. We are going through benefit testing, et cetera. We're not going to go into the specifics of which business migrates at which period of time, but I guess suffice it to say that we have kind of worked through a whole number of scenarios and want to make sure that first and foremost it's an absolutely seamless transition. And as you know, we have to go through series of approval processes, et cetera, from states and other things like that. So we're going to work through that.","In terms of your second question about the HRA, I'll ask Pete Haytaian to answer that for you.","Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Pete. There's obviously a lot of proposals out there over the last couple of weeks. I'd say that we're obviously very focused on affordability and sustainability in the marketplace. And as it relates to the HRAs specifically, I think that you've probably read that there were appropriate safeguards put in place to sort of address that.","So while it is addressing the affordability concept, it also had safeguards in there to ensure that employers don't inappropriately take that risk and push it into an individual marketplace. So we feel very good about that. That's generally how we look at these things being supportive of affordability in the marketplace, but also being very keenly focused on sustainability in the marketplace.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you. And thank you for all of your questions and for joining us this morning in Anthem's third quarter conference call. As you can see, we are well-positioned for 2019, and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us.","I want to thank each of our associates for their commitment to Anthem and all of those individuals we serve.

Welcome to the Anthem Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management.","Douglas R. Simpson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, and welcome to Anthem's second quarter 2016 earnings call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Joe Swedish, Chairman, President and CEO, and John Gallina, our CFO.","Joe will offer some commentary on the recent DOJ actions and provide an overview of our second quarter 2016 financial results and then John will walk through the financials of our business units and provide some incremental commentary around our updated 2016 outlook. We're then available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call.","Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. This morning, we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, with membership and revenue tracking above our previous expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.91.","Before John and I discuss the details of our second quarter financials and our updated 2016 outlook, I think it's appropriate to discuss our perspective on the latest Cigna developments. I'll start by saying, we are disappointed by the U.S. Department of Justice's decision to block Anthem's acquisition of Cigna. A combination specifically designed to tackle our healthcare systems challenges head on and deliver greater value to consumers by expanding access to high quality, affordable healthcare. To be clear, our board and executive leadership team at Anthem is fully committed to challenging the DOJ's decision in Court.","As you may have read in Tuesday's published Op-Ed, the DOJ has disregarded the issue of access for two of the most unstable and at high risk health insurance markets; individuals and small businesses. These populations comprise a meaningful portion of the still more than 33 million uninsured Americans who will benefit from the Cigna acquisition through expanded and improved access, affordability, and quality.","For example, despite the many and continuing challenges of the health insurance exchanges, Anthem entered into this new and high risk market at its inception. Though several of our competitors have exited this business, we now serve 923,000 public exchange members across 14 states where we do business as Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan.","As shared with the DOJ, our acquisition of Cigna will help stabilize pricing in this volatile market, enabling Anthem to continue its commitment to the public exchanges, and provide the opportunity to expand our participation to 9 additional states, where neither Anthem nor Cigna currently participate.","Additionally, we estimate this acquisition will significantly lower cost for our self-funded consumers with over $2 billion in medical cost savings that we passed directly back to them.","Finally, we also note this acquisition will benefit our shareholders and the pension, retirement, and investment funds they represent. Specifically, 99% of our shareholders voted in favor of this transaction.","Now to discuss the consolidated financials we reported this morning. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.33 was slightly ahead of our expectations, albeit with mixed financial metrics to get us there.","Within membership, both fully insured and self-funded membership are tracking ahead of expectations as we ended the second quarter with nearly 39.8 million members. This reflects growth of an additional 148,000 lives during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date enrollment growth to 1.2 million lives, or 3%.","Specifically, our insured membership increased by 170,000 lives as our Medicaid business grew by a better than expected 280,000 lives in the quarter to over 6.3 million members. This reflected better than expected enrollment growth from the implementation of the Iowa State contract, which started on April 1, as well as better than expected core membership growth within multiple other state contracts.","Within Commercial, our insured enrollment came in line with expectations. We ended the quarter with 923,000 lives from the individual public exchanges, a decrease of 52,000 lives from the 975,000 lives we reported in the first quarter and Local Group insured business declined modestly and in line with our most recent expectations.","Our self-funded business was relatively stable during the quarter, which was better than our previous expectations as we experienced higher-than-expected growth in membership in existing accounts.","Our membership results translated into better-than-expected operating revenue of $21.3 billion. Our second quarter 2016 results represent an increase of $1.5 billion or 7.7% versus the second quarter of 2015, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends.","Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business.","The second quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was 84.2%, which increased by 210 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was partially driven by a higher benefit expense ratio in the Medicaid business, as our medical cost experience exceeded the net impact of annual premium rate adjustments and the impact of growth in membership, which the Medicaid business carries a higher benefit expense ratio than the consolidated company average.","Further, the benefit expense ratio reflects the impact of higher medical cost experienced in the Individual business and the timing of higher medical cost experienced in the Local Group business. The increase was partially offset by adjustments to the prior and current-year risk adjustment estimates in our ACA compliant Individual and Small Group products.","Our SG&A expense ratio came in at a better-than-previously expected 14% in the second quarter of 2016, a decrease of 140 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by an intentional focus on administrative expense control coupled with better-than-expected enrollment trends as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business, which carries a lower than consolidated average SG&A ratio.","We reported operating cash flow of approximately $2 billion, or 1.3 times net income during the first six months of 2016. During the quarter, we reported operating cash flow of $662 million, or 0.8 times net income. As a reminder, we did make our first and second quarter income tax payments during the second quarter, consistent with prior years.","I'll now turn the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, John Gallina, to discuss our business segment's quarterly results and our updated 2016 outlook in more detail. John?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Joe, and good morning. Turning to discuss the second quarter financial performance of our business units. We added 290,000 members in our Government Business during the quarter and grew year-over-year revenue by 9.5% to $11.4 billion. These results now include the impact from the addition of the Iowa contract, which was implemented on April 1.","Operating margin for the Government Business in the quarter came in at 4%, a decline of 190 basis points versus the prior year quarter, which was driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we have been expecting Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels to a more normalized level, and we are monitoring the rate environment for the remainder of the year.","During the quarter, we also experienced higher than expected claims across Medicaid businesses, with the most notable market being the newly implemented Iowa contract. It is important to note that it is not uncommon to have early challenges in a new market, and our team has a long track record of successfully identifying and implementing revenue and cost of care initiatives to help mitigate issues. We will continue to work collaboratively with our state partner to ensure program stability and high quality care for Iowa's most vulnerable citizens.","Within Medicare, we are pleased with the progress the team continues to make and our year-to-date margins continue to reflect improvement versus last year. Our outlook continues to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long-term sustainable levels, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in 2017.","The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid businesses remains substantial, with an estimated $78 billion in contracts to be awarded between now and 2021 in markets that we will consider targeting. A little more than three-fourths of this opportunity is in new and specialized services, with the remainder in traditional Medicaid services.","We continue to believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth, as we help states address the challenges of rising healthcare costs and improving quality for their residents.","Switching to our Commercial business, our enrollment decreased by 142,000 lives during the quarter, which was slightly better than our previous expectations. Specifically, we experienced second quarter declines of 86,000 lives and 51,000 lives in our Individual and National businesses, respectively. The better-than-expected enrollment results contributed to a higher-than-expected operating revenue during the quarter, which increased by 5.7% versus the prior year quarter to $9.9 billion.","Our second quarter operating margin of 10.9% was 120 basis points higher than the 9.7% we reported in the second quarter of 2015. The increase was driven by adjustments to the prior and current year risk adjustment estimates recorded during the quarter, a lower SG&A ratio due to lower administrative cost resulting from expense efficiency initiatives and growth in self-funded enrollment, which carries a higher than average operating margin. This increase was partially offset by higher medical cost experienced in Individual ACA compliant products and the timing of medical cost experienced in our Local Group business.","Within our Individual ACA compliant population, we had previously taken a conservative stance on our balance sheet with respect to various different estimates. This conservatism was very prudent, as our current period claims trends have been higher than expected. We have seen higher than expected costs from membership with chronic conditions such as renal (13:32) disease, COPD, heart disease and diabetes, along with signs of pent-up demand among our new members. We have experienced higher-than-expected payments for dialysis treatments during the first half of the year, which we are in the process of reviewing the drivers of this increase. All-in, our updated outlook now expects the Individual ACA compliant business to incur mid-single digit operating margin losses for the 2016 benefit year.","It is important to note that we have assumed the higher-than-expected claims rate experienced thus far in the year will continue for the remainder of 2016 in developing our 2017 pricing assumptions. To be clear, we believe our pricing for 2017 fully incorporates our current expectations for 2016 claims and we are focused on returning to profitability in 2017.","Relating to National Accounts, we continue to be pleased that the team continues to secure wins contributing to the track record of membership growth in 2017.","Regarding our balance sheet metrics, consistent with our past practice, we have included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we experienced favorable prior-year reserve development of $726 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. We continue to be at the upper end of our range of mid- to high-single digit margins for average deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of June 30, 2016.","Our Days in Claims Payable was 40.6 days as of June 30, a decrease of 2.8 days from the 43.4 days as of March 31. The decrease is in-line with our expectations and consistent with the level of decrease seen between the first and second quarter of 2015. As previously discussed, we expect Days in Claims Payable to come back down closer to 40 days over time.","Our debt-to-capital ratio was 39.1% at June 30, 2016, down 110 basis points from the 40.2% at the end of the first quarter, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity and the reduction in our outstanding balance in commercial paper during the quarter.","We ended the first quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $958 million as of June 30.","For the three Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate, and we continue to establish a 100% valuation allowance against any unpaid receivables for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 benefit years for risk corridors.","For risk adjusters, the recent information from CMS shows us in a net receivable position, primarily in our Small Group markets. We have recorded a valuation allowance against certain risk adjusted receivables in some of our markets based on our assessment of the financial solvency of co-op organizations that are payers into the risk adjuster program due to the belief that those receivables may ultimately not be collected.","As we have said in recent months and in the results we reported this morning, our operating metrics are expected to be different than we previously expected during the last earnings call. That said, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings guidance and expect full year 2016 adjusted EPS to be greater than $10.80, excluding greater than $1.46 of negative adjustment items. On a GAAP basis, our 2016 earnings per share outlook is greater than $9.34.","We are raising our operating revenue outlook by $1.5 billion to a range of $82.5 billion to $83.5 billion, reflecting stronger-than-expected enrollment across our businesses, including the contributions from Medicaid as well as the impact of adjustments to both prior and current year risk adjustment estimates.","Fully insured membership is now expected to be approximately 15 million members at the midpoint of our range, 100,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the Medicaid business.","Self-funded membership is now expected to be 24.7 million members at the midpoint of our range, approximately 200,000 members higher than our previous outlook. Taken together, we now project total membership to be approximately 1 million members to 1.2 million members higher than we ended 2015.","We now expect our medical loss ratio to be in the range of 84.9% plus or minus 30 basis points for the year, reflecting our view that higher than previously expected claims rates in our Individual ACA compliant plans as well as our Medicaid businesses remain at elevated levels throughout the year. This includes the worse-than-expected results in the newly-implemented Iowa market.","Reflecting the expected higher paid claims, we now expect 2016 operating cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. To offset the expected increase in our medical loss ratio, we are continuing the efforts started last year to ensure we have an efficient cost structure. We now expect our SG&A ratio for the full year 2016 to be in the range of 14.5% plus or minus 30 basis points.","We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%. Our updated 2016 outlook does not include any benefit from the impact of share repurchase activity for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we did not repurchase any shares through the first six months of 2016.","Our outlook does include the adverse impact of an additional $0.02 in assessments associated with the dissolution of the Ohio Co-op. This is in addition to the $0.03 of assessments we previously discussed in our first quarter call associated with the state of Colorado dissolution of their Co-op. We have not included any additional assessments beyond those incurred in Colorado and Ohio in our outlook.","It is important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction cost associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first half of 2016, nor does it include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue we believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI.","With that, operator, please open the queue for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of A. J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hello, everybody. First just to maybe try to clarify a little bit more on the outlook for the year and particularly what you're assuming for the back half. If my numbers are right, you're allowing for about a 300 basis point to 400 basis point deterioration further from what we saw first half MLR to back half MLR and you're getting obviously, as you say, the SG&A leverage. Two parts to this. Is that a normal seasonal pattern? Are you allowing for any other contingencies on the MLR assumption in the back half? And would you characterize what you're doing on the SG&A side as something that's sustainable, or are these sort of extraordinary measures in light of the MLR pressure that you've experienced?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, A. J., this is John. Thank you for the question and good morning. Yeah, so a couple questions in there in terms of MLR and G&A. But, first of all, in MLR, your math is certainly appropriate from the first half to the last half. And really what we've seen is that we've got an elevated amount of utilization specifically in the ACA Individual compliant plans as well as in Medicaid and most significantly, they're in Iowa. And we're at least, for purposes of our outlook, assuming that that elevated level is going to continue throughout the rest of the year. So, while certainly if there's any mitigation factors or medical management initiatives end up being more successful than we're planning, there could be upside. But it's really it has to do with taking the elevated levels of utilization we've seen and just essentially run-rating them for the rest of the year.","In terms of the G&A, I'd say the bulk of the G&A is sustainable. What we've really done is done an outstanding job of fixed cost leveraging. We're increasing membership here this year between 1 million members and 1.2 million members and maintaining our cost structure relatively constant. We are growing. Our head count increased in the second quarter, but it increased at a far, far slower rate than our membership increased. Revenue's going up about $2.5 billion, $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the change in guidance from the beginning of the year to today, yet the raw SG&A number is only going up very slightly.","And so, it's really has as much to do with an excellent job of fixed cost leveraging. And clearly we are looking at some inefficiency and waste in terms of our processes and continue to look at those very closely on a regular basis and try to eliminate those things. And at the end of the day, the last piece of it really is that we're a pay-for-performance company. And as a pay-for-performance company, in order to get our bonus payments, we have to hit our targets. And to the extent that we don't hit our targets, we'll reduce our bonus structure. So that's something that we're looking at very closely, as well.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. If I could do just a quick follow up. Joe, thanks for the comments about the Cigna transaction. I might just ask, do you have any updated assessment of the timeline from here? And then I think the merger agreement goes through the end of this year. Can you just mention to us what happens after the end of the year if we're still in the Court dealing with the proposed transaction?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Got it. Thanks, A. J. First of all, when you referenced the end of the year, actually we had the option on our side, our call, to extend it to the end of April, which obviously we intend to do so. So I just want to make that record clear that we will continue and obviously we're going to run out the litigation as long as it takes, working towards the end of April. Our expectation is, I guess, under normal or usual circumstances claims like this, we're expecting the trial to begin somewhere around October, and at the outside, we're looking at four months. We believe it'll be about four months. Obviously it could run a little longer, but that's our expectation.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. I think I'm going to ask just very similar questions to A. J., but just I guess a different perspective. So on the MLR, forgetting about sort of the first half versus second half, on a year-over-year basis, the first half is up 188 basis points and that's only three months of Iowa and you get some ACA benefit, but the second half looks more like an increase of 140 basis points. So, the way I'm looking at it year-over-year you're actually expecting some noticeable improvement in the second half. So my MLR question is, what's causing that improvement on a relative basis?","And then, John, on the G&A side, I think you mentioned that growth is going up a lot less than the revenue growth. But the way I look at it is, second quarter you added $1.5 billion to revenues, but took $600 million of G&A out. So it looks like there are noticeable savings. And I guess I'm just curious, is that deferred investment or is that some other sort of savings on the G&A side?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Josh. Great question. So, yeah, first half we'll be clear. On the MLR, yeah, the first half of the year had the benefit of three Rs in it. The run rate of claims outside of three Rs is worse, and so that's obviously being baked into our outlook and our thought process.","On the admin side, quite honestly, the single largest driver of that year-over-year is the bonus program that I referenced at the end of A. J.'s question in terms of being a pay-for-performance company. We adjusted our bonus payable appropriately based on ensuring that we're going to hit our $10.80. And so, that's certainly a positive, the reconciliation.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And John, what was the three R benefit? And I don't know, is there a way to size Iowa's impact in 2Q as well?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The three R benefit in and of itself, we don't provide the level of specificity that you're probably asking for. In terms of Iowa, I'll just say that Iowa is a brand new market and we expected it to be dilutive in 2016 as we implemented our various medical management and revenue optimization processes. We ended up with about 25,000 more members in Iowa than we originally expected when we did our plan at the beginning of the year. And, quite honestly, the MLR in Iowa, is 25 basis points to 30 basis points higher than we expected when we did our plan as well. So we got the additional members and it's more dilutive simultaneously with the elevated claims level.","The really good news for that is that our plan, we look at what we've done here historically, what the team has done historically in terms of new markets and implementing the managed care type processes and procedures and the fact that the first-year markets have historically been dilutive and that we've guided to target margins within our 18-month to 24-month period of time. There's no reason to believe that that's not going to occur again here in Iowa given though the starting point may be a little bumpier than we had hoped.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And you said 25 basis points to 30 basis points or points higher?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Josh, 25 points to 30 points higher, not basis points.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Points. Okay. So it's a huge number. Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay. That makes sense. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Windley. Just wanted to come back to \u2013 maybe if you guys could help us bridge sort of the puts and takes. I know obviously the overall guidance remains the same in terms of EPS, but I think by the math that you guys presented on the Individual book being at a mid-single digit loss, it sounds like that's about a (30:26), and then on top of that, you've got the Medicaid challenges that you highlighted. Is that sort of the right way to think about it? And then the offset being largely just the SG&A improvement on top of that to offset those two negatives?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, the other part of that is the top-line growth is very clearly a good guide, it's part of all that. But, yeah, those are the most significant pieces.","I think the good news is, and just to sort of maybe answer your follow-up question before you ask it, is that as we look at 2016 versus 2017, let's be very clear, as I said in the prepared comments, when we did our pricing for 2017, we already had taken this elevated level of claims and utilization into account and baked it into our 2017 outlook. So we believe that this is more of a one-year type of issue and that we're very committed to returning the ACA block of business back to profitability in 2017.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","So you did address my question earlier on the follow-up. So is it \u2013 I guess so it seems like you priced for these things to happen, and in some ways, it still seems like it's worse than expected. So if you were filing rates and benefit changes earlier in the year, maybe you can just give us more comfort about specifically how you caught these things earlier on when we're starting to see more of the development come in with higher utilization on the dialysis and COPD and the other elements that you've talked about?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, sure. Well, the rates were developed in the April\/May timeframe, and so if you look back at our \u2013 when we closed the books in March and the information we had available to us at that point in time, we had seen some of the spikes and the elevations, just not to the same \u2013 we weren't crystal-clear then it was going to continue for the rest of the year or not. However, we wanted to be conservative. We wanted to be prudent. And so we believed \u2013 we had hoped that it was not a trend. However, when we did our pricing, we felt it was best to assume it was a trend.","Here we are 90 days later. I believe our conservatism turned out to be prudent, in that something that we weren't sure if it was going to be a trend or not probably is. There's still the opportunity that seasonality could be in our favor and that things could get a little bit better in the second half of the year. We just have decided not to assume that at this point in time.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then if I could just ask on Medicaid, I know obviously you highlighted Iowa and then you mentioned that broadly, there was just higher trends. Is it predominantly just Iowa being the drag in Medicaid, or are there some specific other states? And maybe if you could sort of share a percentage of the weighting? Is it 75% Iowa, 25% other states, and highlight what those other states might be and the issues that you're seeing there?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In terms of \u2013 it is both, Iowa as well as other states, and we really don't get into specifics state-by-state. We're just calling out Iowa as a marker because it's brand new and it is a significant driver in and of itself. I will say that the primary drivers of the elevated trends, they're pharmacy, nursing facilities, ER, and outpatient surgery. Those four items are really the most significant part of our trend issue in the other states. So \u2013 but we are seeing elevated trends in several states and we're addressing those accordingly.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. But fair to say well above 50% is attributable to Iowa, though?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We really don't get into that level of detail on a state-by-state basis for competitive reasons.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. So just going back to the exchange business here. Just think about it big picture, right? In 2014, you guys were actually profitable. Last year you were close to break-even. This year you're now losing money here. So what has really changed over that timeframe? Is it just the risk pool has continued to get worse? And therefore is this something you can actually rectify with pricing? Are there structural issues to the exchanges, or are there other more meaningful benefit changes, i.e. networks or other design changes that you've also incorporated for next year that are going to be necessary to offset what's been a steady deterioration in the profitability of this book every year? Thanks.","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, sure. No, great question. And in terms of will pricing by itself rectify it, no. Because there's no one single bullet that actually solves the entire problem. The administration is extremely focused on having a sustainable marketplace, and we think that we've been a very active participant in the exchanges and been a great partner with CMS in trying to help with the stability of the marketplace. They've made changes over the years of tightening the supplemental enrollment a bit and various other requirements. The penalty continues to increase. We think all those things obviously have to be done.","Other things that would certainly help the acceleration of the stabilization would be to eliminate the health insurer tax beyond 2017. The risk adjuster model, it does a lot of what it's intended to do, but quite honestly, there's a bit of an imbalance that it overcharges for healthy and over-reimburses for certain moderately unhealthy disease states. We think, as I said, the supplemental enrollment period, we really do need a better up-front verification process. And that there should not be any restriction on our efforts to innovate product designs to meet consumer needs. And then modifying the grace periods for nonpayment of premiums would be something else.","So those are just, in addition to the pricing, things that we've been working with the administration on and believe should occur. We do believe that with the medical management and various other issues that we can help get this back to profitability here in 2017.","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, this is Joe. Let me just weigh in to add to what John just shared with you. Just to reiterate. We've been a very active participant in the exchanges from the very beginning, and recognize the markets have taken longer than expected to stabilize, and we've stated that repeatedly, and I think we've been working very closely with the administration and conducting our own modeling to best judge how we're going to continually engage year-over-year in as profitable a context as possible. It's interesting to reflect back at the end of the first quarter, we told you that \u2013 end of June 30, we'd probably have greater insight into the membership we've captured, recognizing that we had a substantial uptick in membership. It deteriorated a little bit at the end of Q2 to around 925,000 or so members.","But what we've observed in terms of the intensity of illness is that as, John pointed out in his earlier remarks, we're dealing with some chronic illnesses like cardiac, diabetes, COPD, we've had what we think is a material uptick in dialysis cost that have hit us. So we're going through an appraisal of all of that in terms of how to better medically manage those members as well as begin pricing it into 2017. That's the trick. I think John has stated it and I'll restate it. We believe we're well positioned for pricing in 2017 given what we now know about the membership we've captured. And so, I guess, when you put all that together, what we're waiting for now is rate approvals by state, and I can assure you that we're going to be extremely prudent in our continuing engagement.","I think we're in something like 138 or so rating regions, and we're going through an appraisal of every one of those regions. And we'll make prudent business decisions in terms of flexing our engagement in appropriate ways going into 2017, and so I just want to assure you that notwithstanding we've been active participants, we're also very, I'll use the word prudent, very thoughtful in terms of executing a good business practice in terms of how we continue to stay engaged in the public marketplace.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. That was very helpful. Thinking maybe a little bit more broadly, you kind of reiterated your Small Group or Local Group, rather, trend assumptions here, but you did kind of call out timing and medical cost experience for Local Group. Maybe you can just talk a bit more about what you're seeing around trend, if there's any pockets you're seeing in patient, et cetera, as it relates to how you define it? Thank you.","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, sure. So in terms of trend on the Local Group side, that's actually going very well, and we reaffirmed the 7% to 7.5% outlook for that and feel very comfortable with that given the results for the first half of the year. In terms of the timing, that relates to just a couple really accounting and calendar quirks. The first quarter of 2016 had an extra workday in it driven by leap year. The second quarter of 2016 had an extra workday in it driven by how the weekends fell. The fourth quarter of 2016 has one less workday in it, and so it's significant enough to change the timing pattern on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And you take that into effect that our overall product mix in the group side is slightly richer than the overall product mix in the group side a year ago. That changes the timing as well given how the deductibles work.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go head.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just a couple questions. Did you give us the total exchange enrollment as of the end of 2Q? Did I miss that?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it's 923,000 members.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And the total \u2013 when you talk about the ACA compliant book now being mid-single-digit losses, what is the total ACA compliant enrollment that you're speaking to? So presumably that's some op exchange and some Small Group ACA compliant as well?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","A little more than half of the remainder is ACA compliant.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I just wanted to come back to the risk adjustment. Because it seems like potentially it was quite material in the quarter. I know you guys only disclose that you had a payable at year-end. We calculate that payable about $105 million in the swing factor to $190 million payment that CMS was citing for 2015 was about $0.60. You say that you booked some valuation allowances against that because of the Co-op situations, but, I mean, should we assume that material portion of that $0.60 was trued up in his quarter?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There was a lot of things that went against it, and I'm not going to really comment on your estimate of the payable. But in terms of valuation allowance, it was clearly part of it. Certainly medical loss ratio rebates were part of it. After all the dust settled, we're going to pay over $100 million in MLR rebates in 2016 related to the 2015 calendar year. And so that's part of it.","You've got the Small Group versus the Individual component is clearly a piece of it, risk corridor true-ups, I mean, there's so many moving parts it's hard to, on a call here, pin that down exactly. And then quite honestly, whatever benefits existed after all the other offsets have now been baked into our trend outlook and our guidance for the rest of the year.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. If I could, just two quick clarifications. I think Josh was asking about the G&A run rate and sustainability of that. The guidance for the second half certainly implies this reduced G&A is fairly sustainable. But as you head into 2017, do you feel like there's going to be a deferred level that has to rebound, or is this sort of G&A ratio a number that makes sense as a jumping off point heading into 2017?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The most significant driver of the G&A benefits here compared to our guidance or our outlook is the top line revenue growth and the fixed cost leveraging associated with that. And so that clearly is run rate and sustainable. In terms of certainly as an employee of the company, I'm fully supportive of getting back to the bonus structure back to target levels, but there's a natural hedge associated with that. So as results warranted, we then record the expense. If they don't warrant it, we don't record the expense. So what the impact that might be on an exact ratio is to be seen, but the bottom line has a natural hedge built in.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","My last one. When we think about the year, ACA compliant business worse than you had anticipated. Iowa and Medicaid overall worse than anticipated. Yet you maintained the guidance. So the two components that were better that allowed you to maintain compliance was risk adjustment and some of the additional enrollment growth? Is that fair?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, certainly admin, risk adjustment, enrollment growth, we're doing extremely well in the National, and large local ASL in terms of enrollment. Our Medicare Advantage and our Senior business are doing very, very well and exceeding expectations for the year. And, quite honestly, we had a bit of an initial conservative posture at the beginning of the year as well. So, it's a lot of things. Our specialty product line is beating expectations, so I would hate to just point to one or two items because there are far more positives than there are negatives. It's just that the two negatives have really caused our conservative posture to be a more prudent posture.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. First just a follow-up on the SG&A number for that bonus program. I understand that, as you said, it's a hedge and other things have to improve to offset it, but can you give us a ballpark number there in terms of how much cost comes back into SG&A if you fully accrue that for next year?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, in terms of exactly how much that is, the bonus program at target is certainly a significant number in and of itself, but, Justin, that's just not a number that we're comfortable giving out.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Is there any way to proportion it, for instance? You're losing \u2013 you said mid-single-digits on the Individual side, I mean can you remind us what's the ACA compliant premium number for this year, ballpark?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a bit north of $6 billion. Close to that. Maybe closer to $7 billion.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So you're talking about $300 million plus in potential just getting back to break even, right, in the Individual business? Right? Is that how we should think about the earnings power of the business? I assume you're not expecting to run losses for even the intermediate term here as you talked about? So...","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm not going to argue with your math.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So if Individual comes back to break even or better, does this SG&A basically offset that? Or is it larger or smaller than Individual coming back to break even?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, there's \u2013 certainly it's a natural hedge built in, but to answer your question would be to answer the question that you asked the first time. So good luck. It's a big number. But we're not going to size it specifically.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. But you wouldn't call me crazy if I said it was in the same ballpark as getting back to break even in Individual?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would never call you crazy.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Last question just on the Government side. So you've laid out the issues here and you were very clear coming into 2016 saying, for instance, Medicaid was \u2013 the margins were unsustainable, they were going to come down, plus you were going to have the Medicaid pressure in Iowa. I guess, what I'm trying to think about here is, these margins are down meaningfully for 2016 in the Government overall, and you're saying Medicare is actually improving. So Medicaid's the full brunt. My question is, is Medicaid now at a target margin for 2016 when you think about it overall, or does the Medicaid margin actually improve going forward from here given how tough it's been and the worse-than-expected cost overall?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's \u2013 the Medicaid margins are within our target range. Obviously, we're hopeful that we can improve it to the high end of the range, but even with all these headwinds and the negative comments that we had earlier in the year, we're still within the range.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","So for the full year you're within the range, but closer to the midpoint to the low end, and potentially can improve it towards the higher end again, where you've typically been?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a reasonable way of thinking about it, yes.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Hi. I've got a couple questions. I guess first on the exchanges, I guess obviously you guys believe that you've caught everything as far as pricing for next year and you expect margins to improve next year. But I guess we've seen now, I don't know, five quarters or six quarters in a row where it kind of seems like the costs continue to rise for you, but really for a lot of the players out there. I mean, can you give a sense as to why you feel confident saying that, given the experience of most companies over the last year-and-a-half?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Why we believe that we've caught everything?","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Yeah, exactly.","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think \u2013 well, a lot of it obviously has to do with our data analytics and how we track things. And as you look at the rate increases that we've put in, approaching 20% range on a weighted average basis across our 14 states, very significant. And as we \u2013 we also believe that we have some of the best-in-class risk adjuster capabilities of really understanding what drives risk adjuster and things like that and I think the results that we saw from the CMS true-up really helped verify that.","So, the other piece that gives us a little bit of comfort in terms of having caught everything is that our 2016 risk adjuster that we're assuming in 2017 really is based on 2015 experience. So we think that that gives us a natural cushion associated with how that's being approached. But at the end of the day, the question is, how do we know we've gotten everything? Well, we've got six months of information, obviously, there's a lot of new members associated with this block of business. And we can't provide absolute certainty, but we think we have a very, very good line of sight. What we saw at the end of the first quarter, we sort of predicted from a pricing standpoint and what we saw at the end of the second quarter was exactly consistent with that pricing prediction. So we feel good that we've got a good line of sight on that.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","I guess is there anything different about you heading into Q3 this year versus you heading into Q3 last year as far as what you're doing from a data analytics perspective, or anything there that gives you more confidence or visibility this year than what you had heading into the back-half of last year?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, this is Joe. I certainly believe that we're always improving year-over-year and especially in this space, given we've got more and more data. We certainly recognize that this is a company that's had a longstanding engagement in high-risk pools. We have a lot of data that has backed us up for a long period of time. And I think that we just, as I said a moment ago, always expect to continue to improve in this space.","However, I'll reiterate what I said earlier. We're going to be very surgical with respect to our analytics in and around rating regions. We're going to be very mindful of what price increases are awarded to us by state, and so we'll be making very, call it, accurate business decisions going into 2017 and beyond regarding our continued engagement on a broad scale in the public exchange space.","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And then the other comment that I'll just add to that I think maybe to address your, what would be different going into the third quarter is, 2016, we actually had more members come on board on January 1 than we did in 2015 or 2014. 2014 in particular, if you recall, we had a vast majority of the members come on board early second quarter, and in 2015, with the extension of the open enrollment period, a lot of members came on later in the first quarter. 2016, a lot more January 1. So we actually do have a full six months of information this year and we had not had that in prior years.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just last question. Last quarter you said that when you expected the exchanges to be pretty much breakeven this year, you said next year was probably going to be below your target 3% to 5%, but by 2018, you'd be in your target margin. Do you still feel like you still have that same ramp over the next couple of years, or does this setback kind of push back when you're going to get to your target margins on exchanges?","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The pricing increases that we've put in really do keep us on that same ramp. And it's very important that we do receive the pricing increases that we've filed for in terms of that. Obviously, we expect the market to continue to harden and pricing to be more reasonable. I mean, clearly there's a reason that so many co-ops have gone insolvent in terms of their pricing methodology. So as more and more of those folks exit the market, it should provide a more sustainable stable marketplace in 2018 and beyond.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Chris Rigg. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Just with regard to the ACA compliant membership, do you have a sense at this point how many of the individuals were new members to Anthem? And is there \u2013 if you have that information, is there a pronounced difference in utilization trends among those who are new to Anthem versus those that have been enrolled for a year or two?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. A very quick response to the question, a little less than half of the membership was new to us in 2016.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then just one quick follow up here. Of the Individual that's non-ACA compliant at this point, will most of them become \u2013 roll into ACA compliant plans in 2017 because of the grandmothering dynamic, or will they still stay outside the compliant side? Thanks.","John E. Gallina - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, no, a great question. We do expect some attrition in that area, as you pointed out whether the enrollment remains to be seen, but historically, we haven't seen the uptake in ACA compliant plans that maybe was estimated by the CBO when the law was passed. But, yeah, that's certainly a watch area for us.","Operator","And I would now like to turn the conference back to the company's management for closing comments.","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as usual, thanks for your questions. They're all very insightful. As a company, we remain committed to tackling our healthcare system's challenges head-on and deliver greater value to consumers by expanding access to high-quality, affordable healthcare. That's why we're committed to challenging the DOJ's recent decision to block our acquisition of Cigna in Court.","We also want to thank all of our associates for their continued commitment to serving our 39.8 million members every day. Thanks for your interest in Anthem, and we look forward to speaking with you very soon.

Simpson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Welcome to Anthem's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Joe Swedish, President and CEO; and Wayne DeVeydt, our CFO. Joe will discuss our first quarter 2015 financial results and the macro backdrop and also provide additional commentary on our 2015 outlook. Joe and Wayne are then both available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com.","We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. We're pleased to announce a strong first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $3.14, with membership and margins tracking well thus far. We ended the first quarter of 2015 with over 38.5 million members, in excess of 1 million members more than the 37.5 million members we reported on our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call.","Our growth continues to be balanced so far in 2015 as we added 429,000 Medicaid members, 371,000 National members, 102,000 Individual members and 82,000 Local Group members. Notice that this is the first quarter where our results include the impact of Simply Healthcare, which we closed in February and which contributed 205,000 members as of March 31.","Driving our strong first quarter results were solid contributions from both our Commercial and Government segments. Specifically in the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of $3.09 on a GAAP basis and $3.14 per share on an adjusted basis. Our GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share increased from the first quarter 2014, driven by revenue growth, an improved medical loss ratio and opportunistic capital deployment.","We're pleased with the evolution of our diversified business model and believe it bodes well for future growth opportunities. In the first quarter, our membership grew to over 38.5 million lives and our quarterly revenue approached $19 billion. This quarter also marked the first time that Government business represented slightly more than half of our consolidated operating revenues. The diversity of our business model is serving our members and our shareholders well as we leverage capabilities and investments to drive improvements in cost and quality.","During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Simply Healthcare, a Medicaid, Medicare company in the State of Florida. The deal is expected to be earnings neutral on a GAAP basis and to be slightly accretive on an adjusted basis in 2015. Simply's local market experience and strong provider relationships augment our position in the important Florida market and improves our ability to serve local communities with Medicare and Medicaid offerings.","Our provider collaboration efforts continue to grow and we now have roughly $50 billion of our aggregate healthcare spending in value-based contract, of which over half flows from shared saving, shared risk or population-based payments with the balance in pay-for-performance arrangements.","Details vary by contract and market, but they're generally characterized by upfront payments for care coordination and an opportunity for shared savings with our Enhanced Personal Health Care program as a good example. It's about aligning incentives to encourage smarter, collaborative decision-making that fosters healthier outcomes and a better patient experience.","Our position aligns with the goals laid out by HHS earlier this year, calling for 30% of all Medicare fee-for-service provider payments to be in alternative payment models that are tied to how well providers care for their patients by 2016 and increases the goal to 50% by 2018.","In the first quarter of 2015, we have added 18 accountable care organizations, bringing our total number of ACO contracts to 139. To-date, the program includes contracts with over 37,000 primary care physicians through ACOs and patient-centered medical homes who are accountable for the cost and quality of care of 3.8 million Commercial members.","Notable among our new ACOs is an expanded partnership with UC Health, which is Greater Cincinnati's academic medical system covering both our Commercial and Medicare Advantage plans. Under this new arrangement, UC Health's providers will accept value-based reimbursement tied to the total cost of care for their panel of attributed members and gain the opportunity for shared savings payments for meeting specified quality and cost efficiency targets.","We've finalized a study of the results of the first year of Enhanced Personal Health Care and are encouraged by what we have found. We conducted a rigorous analysis of the results comparing members in our Enhanced Personal Health Care program versus those who are not to determine the program's effect.","Earlier results show improved acute care admissions, inpatient days and lower ER utilization, and these improvements led to gross savings per attributed member per month of $9.51. Additionally, our focus on cost of care management is advancing, generating incremental improvements of over $150 million for 2014 and 2015. We have improved analytics to identify actionable trend drivers and we have increased the sharing of best practices across our Commercial and Government segments. We're conducting deep dives on cost of care across our markets and identifying local leadership to drive further improvements in cost outcomes.","Finally, our focus on an improved customer experience is aimed at delivering intuitive and easy experiences to our customers through the channel of their choice. Our consumer culture team is dedicated to systematically modifying the mindsets and behaviors of our associates.","Our consumer work is concentrated on improving the experience associated with key areas such as shopping, post enrollment, and transparency and payment. Our research confirms that customers don't want to exert too much time or effort on their health insurance. Consequently, we are focused on optimizing our capabilities to deliver exceptional services that more closely mirror those experiences that consumers enjoy in the other aspects of their lives.","We have a partnership with American Well whereby our consumers can have a virtual physician visit 24\/7, 365 days per year in 44 states. We also offer convenient care options through LiveHealth Online, which lowers costs and reduces unnecessary ER and urgent care visits. Tools such as Anthem Health Guides help navigate the healthcare system, and our relationship with (9:02) helps our members better understand their healthcare options and choices. We believe the ability to reduce complexity and frustration will be differentiating factors for us.","I'd like to now turn to discuss our Commercial business and execution of our strategies. Commercial membership rose 555,000 in the first quarter, to 29.9 million members. However, revenues declined in the first quarter by 3.4% to $9.4 billion, primarily due to the previously announced decision to discontinue our Employer Group Medicare offering in the state of Georgia account.","Self-funded membership trends in the Commercial business during the quarter were encouraging, increasing by nearly 800,000 versus year-end 2014. This was primarily driven by better-than-expected growth in our large group business.","Private exchange has remained a smaller part of the story, but they're growing off that smaller base. We currently serve 280,000 Commercial members through active group private exchanges, up from approximately 127,000 at year-end 2014.","Roughly two-thirds of these lives are on a self-funded basis, and most of this growth is flowing from our National Accounts segment, with membership coming through exchanges operated by major consulting firms, with the balance generated either through Anthem Health marketplace or broker-led exchanges. The majority of this volume is from existing business, but approximately 35% represent new members to Anthem. While still a small piece of the overall book, we expect private exchange enrollment will continue to grow within our mix over time.","We're optimistic about the outlook for the 2016 National Accounts selling season, having already closed on two large new accounts with a combined membership opportunity of several hundred thousand lives. We have a solid pipeline for National Accounts, and expect solid growth in this area in 2016.","Insured membership in the Commercial business declined, as expected, in our large group and small group businesses. The large group business decline reflected the decision to exit the Employer Group Medicare Advantage market in the State of Georgia account, which was reflected in our Local Group membership, as it was with the Commercial customer. Small group membership declined by 96,000 in the quarter, with total membership ending at 1.36 million.","Individual membership grew by 102,000 during the quarter, due to growth in public exchange lives, partially offset by expected contraction in non-metal products. The amount of contraction was less than anticipated, as retention rates in these non-metal products were better than expected. We believe our exchange strategy is playing out well overall, and our early read is that the demographics of exchange lives appear slightly younger than last year's population.","In the first quarter, we grew exchange membership by 191,000 lives, to 898,000. Overall in the first quarter, Individual exchange enrollment growth was light of our expectations due to lower aggregate growth in exchange lives in our served market and continued pricing pressure in certain markets, including New York, Kentucky and Colorado. We believe that we will continue to grow share as the market pricing backdrop stabilizes toward a more sustainable level, and co-ops and other new entrants gain more experience.","For Three Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate. For risk adjusters, we have slightly increased the net payable position for the 2014 benefit year and have established a net payable position in the 2015 benefit year as well. For risk quarters, we are now in a slight net payable position for the 2014 benefit year, and are in a net neutral position for the 2015 benefit year. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information, and we expect to continue to refine our estimates in these areas, as the relative risk profile of our various competitors become clearer within our markets.","I'd now like to turn to the Government segment and to speak to the solid first quarter results. Our Government business segment is having another strong growth year, adding 483,000 members in the first quarter, driven by strong organic growth in Medicaid and the addition of Simply Healthcare, while generating revenues of $9.5 billion, up approximately 19.4% quarter-over-quarter.","Medicaid enrollment was up an additional 429,000 members in the first quarter. We are very pleased, as both organic membership growth and enrollment coming online from recent contract awards exceeded our expectations.","The pipeline of opportunity for our Government business remains substantial. We currently estimate $65 billion of new business could be awarded by the end of 2018, split about evenly between traditional Medicaid, and new populations and specialized services. We believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of lowering healthcare cost and improving quality for their residents.","Our Medicare enrollment grew slightly in the first quarter, largely due to the acquisition of Simply Healthcare. Excluding Simply, membership remained stable, as our retention was slightly better than expected. Government operating margins improved 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 3.4%. This primarily reflected improved medical cost performance in certain markets in our Medicaid business.","I now want to turn to discuss the key consolidated financial highlights from the first quarter of 2015. I'll also provide updated commentary on our 2015 outlook.","As I stated previously, on a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $3.09 for the first quarter of 2015. These results included net investment gains of $0.08 per share, $0.01 per share of expenses for the early retirement of debt, and $0.12 per share of expenses for deal-related amortization. Excluding these items, our adjusted earnings per share totaled $3.14 for the quarter.","Medical enrollment increased by over 1 million members, or 2.8%, during the quarter to approximately 38.5 million medical members as of March 31. This reflected membership increases in virtually all lines of business.","Operating revenue was nearly $18.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $1.2 billion or 6.8% versus the first quarter of 2014, reflecting robust enrollment in the Government business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with healthcare reform.","For the first time in our company's history, the Government business accounted for more than 50% of our quarterly revenue. The growing diversity of our business aligns with our long-term strategy as we believe we are well-positioned to continue capitalizing on future growth opportunities.","The benefit expense ratio was 80.2% in the first quarter of 2015, a decrease of 250 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The decline reflected a lower medical cost ratio in the Local Group and Individual businesses due to the timing of medical cost experience, improved medical cost performance in the Medicaid business, and the impact of an increase in the health insurer fee for 2015.","For the full year 2015, we continue to expect underlying Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% plus or minus 50 basis points.","Our SG&A expense ratio increased by 50 basis points from the first quarter of 2014, 16.7% in the first quarter of 2015, as expected, largely due to higher healthcare reform fees in 2015 and higher administrative costs as a result of the strong membership growth during the first quarter.","Moving to the balance sheet, days in claims payable was 45.7 days as of March 31, up 3.2 days from the 42.5 days as of December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher reserves associated with new membership coming online throughout the quarter. As previously discussed, we expect delays (18:48) in claims payable to come back down to closer to 40 days over time.","Our debt-to-capital ratio was 39.4% as of March 31, 2015, up 90 basis points from 38.5% as of December 31.","We ended the first quarter with approximately $2.8 billion of cash and investments at the parent company and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $1.1 billion as of March 31.","Moving to cash flow, we generated strong operating cash flow of nearly $1.7 billion in the first quarter or 1.9 times net income. As a reminder, our first quarter cash flows are historically higher than the average quarter as we pay our first and second estimated federal income tax payment in the second quarter.","That said, cash flow trends in the first quarter are encouraging and we remain comfortable in our outlook of greater than $3.5 billion for the full year.","In addition to closing the Simply acquisition during the quarter, we repurchased nearly 5.7 million shares during the quarter for approximately $774 million, representing a weighted average price of $136.88. As of March 31, we had approximately $4.9 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, which we intend to utilize over a multi-year period, subject to market conditions.","We used $167 million during the quarter for our cash dividend, and yesterday the Audit Committee cleared our second quarter 2015 dividend of $0.625 per share to shareholders.","Turning to our full 2015 outlook, we continue to see 2015 as a year of continued growth across our business. We're updating our outlook for full year 2015 adjusted EPS from greater than $9.70 to greater than $9.90, which reflects the solid core trends and run rates seen in the first quarter.","First quarter results and underlying medical cost performance tracked well versus our expectation and bode well for the remainder of 2015. As we said last quarter, the first quarter was expected to represent our highest quarterly earnings level this year.","While we do not offer quarterly EPS guidance, we expect the second quarter to be the strongest of the remaining three quarters, with the first half of the year approaching 60% of our full year EPS. We expect the fourth quarter to be the lowest quarterly EPS figure for the year as a result of the diminishing impact of the Three Rs, the timing of member months, and our overall business mix.","We continue to expect operating cash flow in 2015 to be greater than $3.5 billion and this will be another active year of capital deployment. In that regard, we remain focused on maintaining an appropriate balance between returning capital to our shareholders and ensuring financial flexibility for investments in the future growth opportunities and potential M&A.","While we are encouraged by the underlying trends in the first quarter, it remains early in the year, and we believe our full year outlook is reasonable and prudent.","Wayne and I will now be available for questions. Operator, can you open the queue?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question is from A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just asking on the cost trend. I know you highlighted the experience with the new members being part of the dynamic, but you did outperform us by quite a wide margin, I think, consensus on the MLR trend. Can you drill down a little bit more what you're seeing? I know some of the others have talked about the updated hep C contracting being a factor. And are you just being conservative at this point and not signaling maybe that you're toward the low end of your medical cost trend outlook for the rest of the year, or is there something that we should keep in mind on that?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, A.J. Good morning. Appreciate the question. Let me start by saying that we're only 90 days, really one quarter into the year, and I think from our perspective it was just prudent to wait till we saw the second quarter settle itself out.","That being said, if the trends we had seen in the first quarter were to continue, we clearly would have a bias towards the lower end of our current guidance range at this point in time and really around the things you've highlighted. We are expecting a lower hep C cost for the year and a lower utilization than we had anticipated at this point in time. And overall, we think trend is playing well in all lines of business and in all segments.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then just maybe quickly on my follow-up, I think there was an expectation that there might be some Three R data available from CMS in the spring. That seems to have gotten pushed back. I know there's a hope that we get some final data out in the fall. Can you just maybe walk us through what you're expecting, if you've gotten any preliminary information from them, and how that might affect the back half or rest of the year cash flows and your thinking about these days claims payable you're running?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so relative to the Three Rs, we really don't think that we'll get, as an industry, real quality data till early third quarter, most likely in the July timeframe. The question will be, will we get it prior to 2Q earnings, where we'll have an opportunity to reflect that.","That being said, we are using the Wakely data and other information that we can find available and we continue, we believe, to reserve towards the more conservative end of a range of outcomes. We hope that that proves to be the case, which is a reflection of why our DCP has also continued to be an elevated level and the impact of those.","It's important to recognize, though, that there's a combination of DCP being impacted by just strong reserves. The Three Rs in and of themselves do not necessarily reflect in DCP. So, we think we have conservatism beyond what's in the DCP at this point in time.","Relative to cash flow, our outlook does assume a payout relative to the expectations we've booked at so far. So again, to the extent that that proves to be conservative, we would have upside both in our outlook and our cash flow. But I do want to reiterate, there are a lot of moving parts on the Three Rs and a lot of data that is not in our current custody (26:04), and we're going to need to get the actual data from CMS to be able to finalize any estimates.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just want to talk a little bit about the membership trends. I'm curious, the additional 200,000 lives on the ASO front, maybe just some color as to where that's coming from; is that in-group growth or is that better sales? And then, it looks like you're expecting membership to actually trend down the rest of the year, and I don't know if that's exchanges or if there's something there. And then I guess part C of my one question is just any expected impact from the Assurant sale and what you see in the market from those guys?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Josh. Relative to the ASO, it's a combination of mostly in Local Group. So, we are winning new accounts in Local Group. We obviously had already assumed the significant membership growth in our guidance regarding National Accounts, but we're being successful in the markets. There is some in-group change, but I would say it's a much smaller impact of the membership beat than it is actual new membership wins. So, we're definitely encouraged by that.","We have the membership trailing down though in the back half of the year primarily due to the exchanges. We saw last year that a lot of the enrollees after Q1 actually migrated down throughout the year. We took a conservative posture in our guidance last year, assuming that would be the case, and that in fact played out to be the case. So we're going to assume a similar trend this year, which is a lot of the membership comes in heavy in Q1 and then as the year progresses it slowly ratchets down.","Relative to the Assurant, which I know many of you probably saw last night, I would just say this, Josh, that this is the trend that we thought would be occurring regarding public exchanges. And I think we've been fairly vocal that we think that companies have to not only be local to get the cost of goods sold advantages they need, but they have to have significant depth, and you need to have national G&A leverage to be able to comply with the MLR rules. So, I think these opportunities are going to become more and more as this environment has the Three Rs go away. And from our perspective, we plan to be a participant in that membership as it becomes available.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then, just a quick one, Wayne...","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Josh...","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...Josh, this is Joe.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi 28:21).","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Good morning. I just want to add on to the nice commentary Wayne provided. A very small wrinkle is the small group, which we're going to continue to see declines in membership, as we expected, something north of 100,000 lives. So I just wanted to bring that in, because last year, we had a decline that escalated a little bit more than we had originally forecast, and I think this year, we're expecting continued decline, albeit maybe not as aggressive.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then Wayne, I think you said in the release that PPRD was a little bit higher than expected. Was there a P&L impact that didn't get replenished?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. Regarding prior period, while it was slightly better than we expected, we believe we've re-established all of it within the balance sheet as of March 31 and we think the DCP would be a good idea to point to, in terms of that strength. So, it did come in better. That generally bodes well then as well, Josh, as you know for underlying trend then, because our pricing is assuming a higher level than what we actually saw come through, but we do believe we've re-established it at March 31.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Fidel from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Just questions on the Medicaid side. First, maybe if you can just flag some of the markets that you referenced where you're seeing the particularly favorable medical cost trends, and how that's playing out maybe with some of the floor requirements in those markets?","Then just unrelated follow-up, would just be interested in, I know it's a small market for Anthem overall, but your thoughts on the Kentucky Medicaid reprocurement and how much rebasement in the rates you think could occur as a result of that? Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Scott. Let me first talk about the Medicaid and where we're seeing the positive trends. To be candid, I would say that we're generally seeing it across the board. This appears to be a muted (30:18) trend versus expectations. All markets are performing well relative to our expectations.","We continue to have states, such as the State of Florida, where we assume, with the expansion, that we would have a much higher MLR. That proved to be the case. We are looking for continued improvement in that market versus the pricing environment, but we are expecting rates that will be much more commensurate with what we're seeing in the actual underlying trends in the State of Florida.","And the last thing I would just say is, regarding Kentucky Medicaid, at this point, we're happy with the reprocurement. We think it will give us an opportunity for a bigger piece of the pie than what we initially got with our entry into the market last year. As you know, the rates are an evolving process, so more to come on that, is what I would say. But generally speaking, we're very encouraged, not only at the reprocurements that are out there, because we think we have a chance, not only of retaining but growing, but the significant pipeline that Joe highlighted earlier on in the dialogue today.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Chris Rigg from Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.","Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to see if you guys could provide any color with regard to public exchange enrollment and how, or if, utilization has changed amongst those members sort of year-to-year, people that you've had enrolled for 15 months or so, whether there's been any material difference between how they've used the system, versus people that are more traditional to the healthcare system. Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Chris, let me first start by saying that generally speaking, the demographics this year on employment base (32:02) versus a year ago are just slightly younger. So I would say, all things being equal, things are playing out relatively similar to what we had expected in the prior year.","I would say the volume, though, is not what we had expected. So if we were to point to one area where we were anticipating more volume than we actually got, it was in the public exchange arena. And we think that's going to result in an interesting dynamic, as the year progresses, on what lives shifted to where, in terms of the new lives that came in, and what implications that may have on the Three Rs.","That being said, I would say that it's still early, 90 days in. Remember, a lot of these members last year, because of the exchanges not operating effectively in Q4, really didn't come on until late Q1, early Q2. And so, they started to burn through their deductibles early on in that period, more in the Q2 timeframe versus this year, it's in the Q1. So it's too early to really make a declaration if the trends on that previous membership are improving this year, and it's part of the reason for us maintaining our current trend outlook.","Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, there. I know you're not giving guidance for 2016, but could you give us, broad strokes, how you see things playing out? Is there still opportunity to improve the public exchange margin from here? Is Medicare Advantage going to improve? How do we think about the duals versus Medicaid and small group? How do we think about kind of pluses and minuses for next year?","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Maybe I'll take a run briefly, and then let Wayne jump in. But just to underscore what we said last year, we're continuing into this year, our margin expectation in that space is about 3% to 5%. We see no reason that that would change through the balance of the year, even going into next year.","I think the driver going into next year is the fact that we're going to see this marketplace stabilize, in the sense that other players are going to gain more experience. We have said repeatedly that we believe that pricing will probably gravitate toward a tighter band as more plans become \u2013 getting better experience at the membership they're pricing. So our sense is that this market will evolve by way of maturity, and we think stabilization will certainly play to our benefit in terms of membership capture going into 2016.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And to add to Joe's, Christine, I agree with everything Joe highlighted. I think it's just important to recognize what makes 2016 so unique is that it's the first year with no meaningful headwind. We don't have an increase in the health insurer fee in 2016. Our small group attrition will have meaningfully run its course by the end of this year in terms of the op gain impact.","So as we move into next year, we don't have a meaningful headwind to point to but we do expect a tailwind from public exchange growth with stability in margins. We do expect growth in National Accounts. In fact, we've already logged and locked into significant accounts that will be north of $100,000 in growth already, and we're still in the midst early in the selling season for National for next year. We expect large Local Group growth as well. Medicaid, not only the expansion of margins in those states that are not at our targeted margin levels, but at the same time we expect more membership to continue to come in with all the RFP procurement. We do expect meaningful EBITDA improvement in Medicare starting in 2016 as the first year of the meaningful improvement in a multi-year. And then finally, we expect capital deployment to still play a factor in our EPS growth, not as meaningful maybe as it has in the past but to really start seeing our investments paying off on the top line and the operating earnings growth.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Windley. Thanks for the questions. Want to come back to A.J.'s original question about the cost trend and actually take it a step further and translate that to EPS. With you guys beating (36:03) by $0.45, $0.50 at least relative to the Street, how did that compare to what you were expecting?","And then, I also know you mentioned there was some benefit of timing related to the Local and Individual medical cost experience. Can you quantify how much that was? And at the end of the day, I'm just trying to get a better sense of why the guidance increase was only $0.20 versus something that perhaps might have been better than the 1Q outperformance?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, let me first point to a few things. We had previously highlighted that we expected first quarter to be the highest quarterly earnings level for us. That being said, we did obviously outperform on a run rate basis our own expectations. So at the same time, as we saw last year, there was a significant amount of uncertainty around the Three Rs and how the membership mix would come into play. We believe that uncertainty is real and will continue through 2Q.","If that plays out to be better than expected, we would consider raising more. But at this point in time, we felt comfortable and confident in the $0.20 raise with good line of sight. And again, as more time pans out, we'll see where that goes. But as I said early on in the call, if cost trend stays where it was at in Q1, we could have a much more outperformance than we've guided to at this point. But again, it's 90 days into the year, it's a little early to declare this.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Sure, that's fair. And then just a follow-up on the Medicare margins, you talked about that in 2016 as an opportunity to expand. What's your overall book of margins and how much or at least how much further margin expansion potential is there to get to your targeted range, call it, over the next two or three years, whatever that might be?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We believe a more sustainable margin in Medicare is around the 5% range, and we're several points below that on a sustainable basis. So, I would view it as several points to go on a book that's also going to be growing over time. But I would remind everyone that that's over a multi-year period as we get more of our membership into the four-star rated programs.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","I apologize if I misspoke, I was actually referring to Medicaid.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm sorry, in the Medicaid. On the Medicaid front, we generally think still 3% is the targeted margin that you would want to be participating in over time. We continue to perform well in many of our markets at our targeted margin levels, but I would tell you we have new entry markets that are performing below that level. So we have opportunities not only to improve those markets, Florida being one of those, but in addition to that \u2013 and Kansas being another one \u2013 but I would say in addition to that, the RFP pipeline is meaningful. And just keep in mind that with the RFPs, Individuals generally bid closer to a break even in year one and then you ratchet up over a multi-year period to your target margin.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, hi. Good morning. I thought maybe we could just go back to the enrollment trends for a minute and maybe talk about what you saw. I think you said 96,000 down in small group. And given your knowledge of the customer base, what's giving you confidence that we're reaching the point where that's going to stabilize and you won't see more attrition? And to the extent you've had some perspective of time now, where do you see that enrollment going? Is it then covers drops (39:34) to the ACA exchanges, Medicaid or other places?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Matt, a real good question. And I want to clarify a point here that the stabilization isn't so much in the membership of small group; we may see attrite much more. The stabilization is in that margin fundability between small group and public exchanges. As you know, our goal was to build the biggest catcher's mitt we can build so that whether a member was in Medicaid, a public exchange, small group, that we would have the ability to pick them up in whatever market.","And so, we are seeing, what I would say, a much bigger headwind in EBIT that's been coming down between last year and this year versus the actual membership. So you may continue to see membership in small group attrite, but just recognize that we are now getting closer to targeted margins whether they're in the exchange or small group or Medicaid that we would be comfortable with it.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And, sorry, just to follow up on the larger group side, what are you seeing there in terms of is it continued preference particularly in the middle market at least at the margin for self-funding given that the added burden of the ACA fee that's now increased for this year?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We're still seeing the self-funded be the preference on the larger group side. But I will tell you, as the private exchanges are growing, and still small but more than doubled in the last year, we are starting to see some accounts move from self-funded to fully-insured. Again, not many yet, but the early trend is starting to occur. So again, I think as we get closer to 2017 and the Cadillac tax, that may potentially be an accelerator.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is Joe. Just to underscore, you recall last year we're talking about a private exchange membership enrollment of about 100,000 lives. And we've certainly seen that grow this year, not substantially but certainly the pace has picked up. That gives us some line of sight, to Wayne's point, that we believe that there's probably an escalating interest in private exchanges.","So, we're very mindful of that. I mean we're building our platform to adapt to that shift. And as we've consistently stated, we will be ready when that inflection point occurs. And there's, quite frankly, a very quickened pace toward private exchanges, which we believe will occur in the coming year or two.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. A question on the public exchanges. So, I guess you're booking a risk corridor for 2014 but not for 2015. Does that imply that maybe you outperformed your margin target there in 2014 and expect a little bit of pressure in 2015?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I wouldn't necessarily view it as that. We had a very de minimis risk corridor in 2014. We achieved our targeted margins. We had a little bit of a receivable but we booked a valuation allowance on it. We had, obviously, a payable as well. The net of the two is a net payable, but not meaningful. And I would just say that as we priced for this year, we were trying to price at a level that would be commensurate. We didn't see much value in contributing money into a kitty at the expense of consumers not getting the best price available in the market.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. But it sounds like you may have been at the high end of the range and now you're pricing to normal margin. Is that the way to think about it?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, I would say the corridor last year was so de minimis that we're still at the high end of the range.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just to clarify a comment you made on the private exchanges, you said, I guess, 35% of the membership that you got was new to you. But did you see net enrollment growth there, because I guess your customers would have contributed some membership into the exchanges as well? So just trying to figure out whether there was a net addition.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the private exchanges, yes, yes. We saw enrollment move from around just north of 100,000 at the end of 2014 to over 280,000 at the end of the first quarter this year. So about 180,000 member growth almost, both a combination of new membership as well as conversions.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But I guess I'm just wondering if you had customers representing 300,000 members that moved into the exchange, getting 200,000-plus is actually a net loss. So I'm just trying to understand if you have that number, whether overall it was a net win for you.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That was a net win. About 35% represent new members to us in the exchanges.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andy Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Sort of, just first, a housekeeping question following up on the last one there. So the true-ups on the Three Rs related to 2014, did they actually have an impact in the first quarter here? Was there actually some slight negative impact on the MLRs related to that?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Very de minimis, very de minimis. We took advantage of some new data and did a slight strengthening on the risk adjusters. But again, very de minimis to us.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, so nothing meaningful going on. And then, sort of no one has asked yet, I guess I will. Given the close of Simply Health in the quarter, if you could just kind of remind us on your outlook here for capital deployment and your thoughts on M&A. Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, as you know, we funded Simply Health with cash on hand, which we were pleased with, and bought back more than 2% of our stock in the quarter. We still expect for the full year to deploy between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in the form of buybacks as well as continue to pay our annualized dividend of $2.50. And we still believe that will leave us with some flexibility at the parent north of $750 million of excess cash, which we like to maintain to have flexibility for tuck-in M&A along the way.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","You mentioned you expected a strong selling season for 2016. I think that was in relation to the Commercial business. Can you put a little bit more clarity on why you believe that this early in the season, and also how you contrast that with your view of the expanded use of private exchanges by large employers?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Pete, one of the things is we obviously, at this point in time, have line of sight on those large National Accounts that are choosing to take their business out for either renewal or for new opportunities for us. The reasons for that is at this point in time, if the RFPs have come out, is that they have to make decisions generally by mid-year so that they can implement the new accounts by the end of this year so they have a January 1 effective date.","So at this point, we've been very pleased with what we're seeing in the early selling season. We have already locked in two meaningful accounts that are new to us \u2013 net new accounts to us. And again, we'd like to think that we could have a similar close rate as we did last year, which was almost 50% success rate on new business. So again, early but feeling optimistic.","One of the things I would highlight though that we think has lend itself to our success is that over the last several years, for year one, we've had the ability of offering a zero trend guarantee. And simply put, what we're finding is our customers in year one are actually getting negative trend and continued to get negative trend; that our cost of goods sold advantage on a national basis is so meaningful that anybody that switches to us, that we can generally show them in year one that they will actually have their costs go backwards. And that continues to be the case. And we have not paid any performance guarantees in three years around that zero cost trend guarantee, and it gives us a real unique advantage as we go after National Accounts.","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and I think you asked a tag-along question about the exchanges, private exchanges...","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes.","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And we don't really see that having any kind of material impact on shifting, let's say, membership capture like National Accounts, et cetera. As Wayne said earlier, we've seen a net add related to the private exchange uptake, and it's still modest. Let me just underscore, it is modest, but we're going to be very vigilant going into the year to determine how much more positioning we ought to establish relative to the growth of private exchanges, because we do believe it's coming. But again, it's not having any material impact on our membership capture going into 2016.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","This is a tag-along to that. One of the weak points this quarter was the group Medicare Advantage business, which shows up as Commercial business for you guys. Can you talk about what you're doing to shore up the group Medicare Advantage business, or do you think that's just going to migrate to Individual business going forward?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, keep in mind that, with the State of Georgia procurement that we won last year, as you know, the state was required to make a decision to bring in more competitors. And so, we made a decision to actually leave the group MA business in the State of Georgia. So I think that is distorting the actual results of our performance, was the exit from the State of Georgia account for the purposes of group MA, but we plan to be a participant in the group business going forward.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Do you view that as still an ongoing strong product for yourselves, going forward and for everybody?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We do, we do.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","To make it clear, I guess we can say that Georgia was an N of one (48:56), we believe.","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go head.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the Commercial question. Your operating margin expanded by 440 bps to quite a remarkable 13.5%. What I'm hearing you say is, you're still seeing continued margin compression in small group. As I had understood last year, your Individual margins on the op exchange had expanded. You did not allude to much pressure on the public exchange side. In fact, it seemed like it was generally profitable from the get-go. So, it sounds like comps would've been tougher there. So, what is exactly driving so much margin expansion? Is it hep C or weather? It doesn't sound like it's PYD. So, is that sustainable?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, thank you, Ana. The one thing I would remind everyone though is, last year in Q1, we had very little visibility on any public exchange membership. As you know, that membership came in in late February, March timeframe. A lot of it came on in April, because they extended the open enrollment period. And we maintained very conservative reserves a year ago in Q1 for the unknown.","So if you looked at our DCP a year ago, you'll see that it actually ratcheted down as the year went down and we got better visibility. So some of the profitability that we saw last year in Q3 and Q4, with hindsight, really belonged in Q1. And it's also important to recognize that deductibles are being met in Q1 of this year versus last year, they were being addressed in Q2.","So I think you'll see those margins come down as the year progresses. We clearly will not maintain that level of margin. But when the year is done, I think we'll still have a very strong year-over-year margin of high-single digit to low double-digit range.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","It sounds like public exchanges. So, okay, follow up on that then, on the public exchange membership growth, where did you see the most competition, if you will? Was it more from new membership on uninsured, or was it retention of your existing small group or existing 2014 exchange membership?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","What's interesting is, we found the business to be fairly sticky. So we think the year one strategy was the right strategy, and the existing business remained fairly sticky. We did not garner as much business as we had expected on the new lives coming in. Again, we grew, but not nearly at the level we had anticipated, for a couple reasons.","One is, we still have not seen the co-ops necessarily shore up their pricing at the levels we believe are going to be necessary. And we had anticipated they would shore up a bit more going into this year, but that in fact did not occur. So there are markets, and I think you can view those markets, like a Kentucky and a Colorado and other areas, where we're impacted by the co-ops.","But generally speaking, we'd say the large national players, publicly traded companies, seem to be pricing fairly rationally. And so, it's more on the co-op side that we saw the pricing that we're willing to wait it out on.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Very helpful color. Thanks, Wayne.","Operator","And our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. I may have missed this; did you talk about the ASO book and what drove the higher enrollment guidance, and how much is being driven by new wins versus conversion of risk? And I guess, is it your sense that more mid and smaller employers are contemplating sort of shifting to self-funding, in part to avoid the industry fee, or do you think we're past that point?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Ralph. Yeah, we highlighted briefly at the beginning just the idea that the stronger enrollment was really around new Local Group membership wins. Very little was due to in-group change. So, just new wins in the market, continue to be successful across our many segments.","I'd say the ASO trends have stabilized. As we said earlier, we're starting to see, even in the private exchanges, that people are starting to migrate to fully-insured. Again, it's small, but in general, it seems that the ASO trends have stabilized. And I think the next couple years, with the Cadillac tax, will be an important inflection point, to see how the markets respond.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. And then, just on that private exchange and the shift, in your opinion I guess going forward, do you see sort of that migration to private ASO exchange or private risk exchange?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it will be a little bit of both. Right now, it's about two-thirds is on a ASO basis and about a third is on a fully insured. The thing I would say is any member that moves from ASO to fully-insured, though while lower margin, is better cash flow. So it's all what you believe is the most valuable input. But from our perspective, we prefer the cash flow.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And I guess just on that point, if it's sort of ASO to ASO, can you talk about the dynamics of the economics or the profitability of that? Is it fair to assume that given the greater competition, that that would be somewhat lower in terms of shifting to a private exchange?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, moving from a ASO to ASO does not necessarily change the economics. So moving from ASO to fully-insured does create a cap for the employer, a more meaningful cap that they can manage over time. At the same time, it does move to a lower margin business which requires risk-based capital associated with it. But that lower margin generally still generates two to three times more cash flow on a per member per month basis than you would have otherwise generated in ASO.","So it's a little more capital intensive as they switch over, but in the long-term it generates a lot of cash flow, which gives us more flexibility in terms of investing in our business and in M&A.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful. I guess I was just talking more about ASO to ASO. So, you're saying the profitability on that would be similar. I would have just assumed when you move into private ASO, there could have been more competition in there that maybe would drive the economics of that business lower. Is that not the right way to think about it?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's fair to assume that that would be the case. But I would say because of our COGS advantage, we think we can show a value profit that allows us to maintain comparable membership and margins.","Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management.","Douglas R. Simpson - Anthem, Inc.","Good morning and welcome to Anthem's first quarter 2017 earnings call. This is Doug Simpson of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Joe Swedish, Chairman, President and CEO; and John Gallina, our CFO.","Joe will provide some high level commentary in our first quarter financial results, discuss our business unit performance, and then provide some high-level commentary on our updated 2017 financial outlook. John will then discuss our key financial metric performance during the quarter and provide some additional details on our updated 2017 outlook, before turning the call back over to Joe to discuss the pending Cigna acquisition, and the long-term PBM solution development process. We will then be available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at www.antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict, and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release, and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. We're pleased to announce strong first quarter 2017 GAAP earnings per share of $3.73, and adjusted earnings per share of $4.68, which is ahead of our expectations with membership and revenue tracking well. It was a great quarter, and John and I look forward to discussing it with you. I'm also going to offer my perspectives on the dynamic political landscape, the premium rate calculation process we will use to file preliminary rate filings in the individual ACA-compliant business, provide you an update of the pending Cigna acquisition, and provide an update on our PBM strategy.","Our first quarter results reflect business performance that track well versus our expectations. Specifically, membership grew more than expected, and we reported strong quality earnings metrics, while maintaining appropriate conservatism on our balance sheet to reflect the dynamic nature of the marketplace that exists today.","The company grew enrollment by 715,000 during the quarter. Insured enrollment grew by 330,000 in the quarter, driven by growth in all of our major lines of businesses. As an example of the value proposition we are bringing to the market, our Local Group fully-insured enrollment grew by approximately 50,000 lives during the quarter, well ahead of expectations and in a line of business that is contracting across the marketplace.","In the Individual business, enrollment increased by 222,000 lives, and we ended the quarter with nearly 1.6 million ACA-compliant members with 1.1 million of those members on the individual exchanges. The remaining, approximately 300,000 members, are in non-ACA compliant grandmothered or grandfathered plans, which continues to decline as expected, a decline of a little less than 100,000 since the prior-year quarter.","Medicare enrollment grew by 38,000 during the quarter, primarily driven by growth in our Medicare Advantage product offerings. Our self-funded business grew by 385,000 members, in line with our expectations, to 25.1 million members. This marks the fourth consecutive year of membership increases, demonstrating the value that Anthem brings to the marketplace with our best-in-class cost of care position, coupled with highly effective medical management capabilities.","We're pleased with our first quarter results and updated outlook, and we remain focused on optimizing performance of our assets to drive sustainable growth. We recognize many opportunities across our businesses, as our industry continues to face disruption on multiple fronts. In response to this dynamic external environment, I believe it is critical to improve our speed to market, corporate agility, and overall performance. I've challenged our leadership to take a hard look at our business operations, and culture, to optimize sustained value creation for all of our stakeholders.","Anthem is in a position of strength, with a diverse portfolio of outstanding assets and a dedicated team of leaders and associates. This strategy reinforces our confidence in improving our long-term earnings growth rates toward the upper-single digit to lower-double digit range beyond 2017, as we discussed in our last earnings call. We are continually balancing our near-term results with our longer-term strategies. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the future.","Our strong first quarter financial performance reflected contributions from both Government and Commercial Businesses. In the Government Business, we added 70,000 members during the quarter, reflecting growth of 38,000 in our Medicare business; 29,000 in Medicaid; and 3,000 in the Federal Employee Program. The enrollment growth, coupled with rate increases, translated into first quarter 2017 Government Business operating revenue of $12 billion, or growth of 11.4% versus first quarter of 2016.","Operating margins for the Government Business were 2.6% during the first quarter of 2017, a decline of 40 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. The expected decline was primarily due to the impact of the one-year waiver in the health insurance tax in 2017 which, as you know, is not tax-deductible.","During the quarter, we recognized retroactive revenue related to the Iowa Medicaid contract. This adjustment has been agreed upon with the State to partially cover the significantly higher than expected claims costs experienced since April 2016. While the additional revenue enhanced our first quarter performance, our initial outlook expected the improved Iowa rates to take effect with the July 1 rates. Therefore, the benefit of this adjustment has not yet been incorporated in our updated 2017 outlook.","We will continue to work collaboratively with our state partner and make progress with the understanding that we need to receive actuarially justified rates in the rate renewal process. We remain confident we will meaningfully impact Iowa citizens by improving the cost and quality of care, as we have done for other state partners.","Aside from the additional revenue recognized in Iowa, our first quarter performance was in line with expectations in the Medicaid business. The current Medicaid pipeline continues to be robust. We're implementing new business in Virginia and Texas that should go live later in 2017. In addition, there are six active RFPs of which we expect to hear about over the next couple of months, with those awards expected to be implemented in 2018.","Looking out over the horizon, we are monitoring an additional 15 to 20 RFPs that we expect to be released over the next year and half, which will include both opportunities for additional business in new and existing states; and existing contract re-procurements, which in many cases will offer the potential for additional opportunities in our current contracts.","Within Medicare, we're pleased that enrollment growth of 38,000 during the quarter exceeded our expectations, primarily in our Medicare Advantage product offerings, as we now have over 50% of our membership residing in 4-star plans. We continue to expect to grow MA enrollment by low-to-mid double-digit percentages in 2017, and perform within our targeted operating margin range.","Switching to our Commercial Business, as I discussed earlier, our enrollment came in better than expected, growing by 645,000 members during the first quarter of 2017, to 31 million members. This growth translated into better-than-expected operating revenue, totaling $10.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of nearly $800 million, or 8.2%, versus the first quarter of 2016.","The strong enrollment gains were across the entire segment, with better-than-expected growth in the Local Group business, fully-insured, and self-funded product offerings. The Commercial team has been focused on identifying opportunities to mitigate the fully-insured enrollment trends experienced over the last few years, and we are pleased that these strategies are proving to be effective in the market.","First quarter 2017 operating margins of 12.7% declined by 90 basis points from the 13.6% in the first quarter of 2016. This decline was due to the impact of the Penn Treaty assessments that were recorded during the quarter, and the first-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. Partially offsetting the margin decline was the benefit of one less calendar day during the quarter, as first quarter 2016 was a leap year, a lower SG&A ratio due to expense efficiency initiatives, and fixed cost leverage from growing operating revenue.","We continue to target improved penetration rates in our specialty product offering, and we're very pleased that our efforts are taking hold in the marketplace. Our dental membership increased by 373,000 or 6.8% during the quarter, and vision membership increased by 405,000 or 6.3% during the quarter.","While we still have additional opportunities to continue to increase the penetration rates for the various ancillary specialty product offerings, I'm encouraged with the momentum this business has generated, as we continue to improve the value of the products we bring to the market and align incentives appropriately within the distribution channel.","In the individual ACA-compliant business, we're all pleased with the membership growth in the open enrollment period, with claims experienced in the first quarter coming in better than prior year, which is reflected in our improved medical loss ratio. However, the claims experienced during the quarter was slightly higher than we anticipated, and we're closely monitoring and analyzing the morbidity of our membership. Given a little under 50% of the population is new to Anthem, we are also not yet able to determine the morbidity of the entire marketplace, which would have implications for the risk-adjusted calculation.","We should have a more thorough understanding in Q2 of our expectations for full year 2017 financial performance. Reflecting on these dynamics and recognizing the level of volatility in the individual ACA-compliant product offerings, we are assessing our market footprint in 2018 as well as rate increases necessary to reflect the underlying morbidity and expected cost of this population.","Our financial expectations vary by market and some markets are expected to be operating on a sustainable basis. We will continue to focus on participating in only those markets, which are in a visible path towards sustainability, including factors like the expected financial performance, regulatory environment and underlying market characteristic. We are pleased that some steps have been taken to address the sustainability of the market, such as addressing the risk adjustment formula in 2018 and verification of eligibility requirements for special enrollment period members on the federal exchanges.","We're pleased to see the final market stabilization regulation and anticipate that it will have a long term positive impact. These changes should help improve stability, but there's still significant uncertainty around some key funding components. For example, we do not yet have certainty that funding of the cost sharing reduction subsidies will be continued. Additionally, under current law, the health insurance tax will be reinstated in 2018, negatively impacting the affordability of fully-insured products, including Medicaid and Medicare.","It's estimated that before accounting for any other issues, rates could increase by an additional 20% or more if CSR subsidies are not funded. The return of the health insurance tax is also expected to increase rates by an additional 3% to 5%. Obviously, this level of additional increase would cause further market instability to a level at which it would be even more challenging to appropriately estimate actuarially sound rates.","At this point, we plan to file preliminary 2018 rates with the assumption that the cost sharing reduction subsidies will be funded. However, we are notifying to our states that, if we do not have certainty that CSRs will be funded for 2018 by early June, we will need to evaluate appropriate adjustments to our filing. Such adjustments could include reducing service area participation, requesting additional rate increases, eliminating certain product offerings or exiting certain individual ACA-compliant markets altogether. Funding CSRs in 2018 and eliminating the health insurance tax going forward are only some of the steps necessary to ensure that the individual ACA-compliant marketplace is not further de-stabilized.","We believe that additional funding in programs such as high-risk pools and reinsurance should be done to help improve the stability of the marketplace, and we continue to work with the administration and members of Congress on these issues.","As we stated in our fourth quarter call, we are monitoring developments closely in the first half of 2017, as we evaluate our longer-term strategy in the individual marketplace. We're analyzing the impact of regulatory changes along with updating our expectations of underlying cost trends, while we continue to advocate for additional regulatory adjustments to ensure both a stable and sustainable individual market. We expect to provide additional clarity on our 2018 market footprint during our second quarter earnings call, if not sooner.","Turning to discuss our updated 2017 financial outlook, we now expect adjusted earnings per share of greater than $11.60 for the full year of 2017, an increase of $0.10 from our previous outlook. I believe our updated outlook is prudent, given the uncertain nature of the individual ACA-compliant marketplace.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our financial statements and provide additional details on our updated 2017 outlook. John?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, Joe, and good morning. I'll begin by discussing the consolidated financial highlights during the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $3.73 in the first quarter of 2017. These results included net negative items of $0.95 per share. Excluding these items, our adjusted EPS is $4.68 for the quarter. These results were favorable to our expectations and, as Joe noted, we are pleased with our strong start to 2017.","As highlighted earlier, our membership results in the first quarter were strong and translated into better-than-expected operating revenues, totaling $22.3 billion. This represents an increase of $2 billion or 9.9% versus the first quarter of 2016. The increase in revenue, as a result of premium rate increases, cover overall cost trends across all lines of business, and higher enrollment in Medicaid, Medicare, and Local Group fully-insured and self-funded businesses. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017, which allowed us to decrease premiums for this component as part of our efforts to address affordability.","The benefit expense ratio was 83.7% in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 190 basis points from the prior-year quarter. This expected increase was driven by the impact of the one-year waiver in the health insurance tax. As expected, the rate pressures and medical cost experienced in Medicaid is contributing to the increase. The Iowa contract, which was not effective until April 1, 2016, is the primary driver of our year-over-year increase in the medical loss ratio.","These increases were partially offset by the impact of one less calendar day in 2017 as the first quarter of 2016 was a leap year, and the net impact of premium rate increases in individual business, particularly within our individual ACA-compliant product offerings and the impact of a retro-revenue adjustment in the Iowa Medicaid contract recorded during the quarter.","Our first quarter 2017 SG&A expense ratio of 14.3% came in higher than expected due to a non-recurring assessment recorded due to the Penn Treaty insolvency, but it's still declined by 150 basis points from 15.8% in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of a one-year waiver of the health insurance tax and from lower administrative cost, which resulted from expense efficiency initiatives coupled with fixed cost leverage on our strong membership growth.","These decreases were partially offset by the Penn Treaty assessments that were recorded during the quarter, which are included in SG&A expenses, but excluded from our adjusted earnings per share calculation.","Turning to the balance sheet, we have included a roll forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the first quarter 2017, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $795 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. Our reserves continue to include a provision for average deviation in the mid-to-high single digits, and we believe our reserve balances remain consistent and strong as of March 31, 2017.","Our days and claims payable was 40.6 days as of March 31, a decrease of 0.7 days from the 41.3 days we reported at the end of 2016. The decline was expected, and is primarily due to the faster claims payment speeds, as we continued to migrate membership on the faster payment platform, primarily within the Government Business.","Our debt to cap ratio was 39.7% as of March 31, 2017, an increase of 120 basis points from the 38.5% at the end of 2016, which reflects the impact of an increase in commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by an increase in shareholder equity and a repayment of a $400-million note that was due in mid-February.","During the first quarter of 2017, the company repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of its common stock for $51 million at a weighted average price of $160.81. As of March 31, 2017, the company had approximately $4.1 billion of board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining.","We ended the first quarter with approximately $4.2 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $687 million at the end of the quarter.","For the 3Rs, consistent with our strategy, we are in a significant net receivable position for risk adjustors for both the 2016 and 2017 benefit year, where we find our insurance estimates and are expecting the pool to pay out at the 50% coinsurance rate. And finally, on risk corridors, we continue to record a 100% valuation allowance for all unpaid receivables for the 2014, 2015 and the 2016 benefit years.","Now, moving to cash flow, for the first quarter of 2017, we reported operating cash flow of approximately $2.7 billion or 2.7 times net income, which was stronger than expected. Cash flow in the quarter included the impact of collecting an extra CMS Medicare payment, and also the fact that we did not make an estimated federal tax payment. As a reminder, we will make two estimated tax payments to the federal government in the second quarter. Even after adjusting for these items, operating cash flow was still strong, reflecting the quality of our first quarter earnings. We used $172 million during the quarter for our cash dividend, and we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.65 per share.","Turning to our financial outlook, we increased our operating revenue guidance for 2017 by $1.5 billion to a range of $88 billion to $89 billion. This increase reflects higher projected membership due to the strong enrollment results seen through the first quarter as we have discussed. Fully insured membership is now expected to be in the range of 15.2 million to 15.3 million, or 100,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger-than-expected growth in both the Individual and Local Group insured businesses.","Self-funded membership is still expected to be in the range of 25 million to 25.1 million, as better-than-expected results in our large group self-funded business is largely offset by slower-than-expected growth in BlueCard enrollment. Taken together, we now project a total membership to be nearly 300,000 to 500,000 lives higher than at the end of 2016. We continue to expect our 2016 medical loss ratio to be 87%, plus or minus 30 basis points, and now expect our SG&A ratio to be at 13.6%, plus or minus 30 basis points on a GAAP basis, which includes the impact of the Penn Treaty assessments, and the Cigna-related transaction costs incurred during the first quarter of 2017.","We continue to expect 2017 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 6.5% to 7%. We are encouraged by our first quarter operating cash flow, and we continue to project operating cash flow to be greater than $3.5 billion in 2017, excluding the potential cash payments related to the Penn Treaty assessments during the year. Regarding capital deployment, the 2017 outlook continues to include the benefit from $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases through the remainder of the year.","To conclude, our 2017 earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.37 on a GAAP basis, which increases our adjusted earnings per share outlook to greater than $11.60. We believe our outlook is appropriately prudent, given the uncertainty in the individual ACA-compliant marketplace and the expected year-over-year margin compression in the Medicaid business, particularly within the expansion population.","It is important to note that our outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first quarter of 2017. Our outlook also does not include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Joe to discuss the pending Cigna acquisition and an update on our PBM strategy. Joe?","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Thanks, John. Relating to the pending Cigna acquisition, we continue to work through the expedited appeal process through the court system. We participated in oral arguments at the end of March, and expect to hear a decision from the appellate court relatively soon. Concurrently, we were also granted our motion for a temporary restraining order to enjoin Cigna from terminating the merger agreement. The next hearing on this motion is scheduled to be held on May 8 in the Delaware Court. We remain committed to completing the acquisition as soon as possible.","Turning to discuss the process of forming our long-term pharmacy strategy, we did issue the RFP during the first quarter. And we expect to receive all responses during the first half of the year. It is important to note that we have not ruled anyone in or out as the best strategic option for the company going forward.","After we receive the responses to the RFP, our pharmacy team will thoroughly and thoughtfully analyze what has been proposed in order to decide how to construct the best pharmacy solution for our members. As I previously stated, this process will be completed by the end of 2017, and we have committed to informing the market of our strategy by that time. We continue to believe that we will be able to lower our pharmaceutical cost by more than $3 billion annually in 2020 and beyond.","With that, operator, please open the queue for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, there. Let's start with Individual. How did Individual develop relative to your mid-single digit range? And, given that we don't know how the risk adjuster's going to look, because they don't have the data and you are last man standing in a couple markets, how did your risk adjuster accrual look versus a year ago?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, Christine. We're happy to respond to that question. In terms of Individual \u2013 I'm not positive what you mean by mid-single digit range, if that's the long-term aspiration in terms of profitability, we did state 90 days ago that we expected our 2017 Individual block of business to be essentially a breakeven, maybe a little bit better. So those are the expectations that we've had for the year this entire time.","In terms of risk adjusters, yeah, we are a risk adjuster receiver. We have \u2013 really have designed our products and had our entire strategy around collecting receivables associated with risk adjusters. In the areas where we were the last man standing, we went back to the various states and changed our rating formulas associated with that, to get additional rates in 2017 associated with those.","So, all in all, the Individual business started out 2017 significantly better than it started out 2016. However, a little bit behind our expectations. We've been very cautious in terms of recording any incremental risk adjusters in 2017 versus what we believe we are entitled to from our strategic standpoint. So to the extent that our morbidity is a little bit worse than the entire pool, we have upside associated with our expectations.","If our morbidity is consistent with the overall pool, then our expectations, I think, are very prudently and appropriately stated. But at the end of the day, we do expect to be a significant risk adjustor receiver.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","You know (32:01) John, I might add also that you just pointed out about claims per quarter being a little excess of our forecast. Our sense is that, as you would expect, one quarter doesn't make a year trend. And we're going to be monitoring this very carefully, given the fact that we've got a member mix that we still have to analyze very carefully. And our sense is that a lot will be known and become clear, as we get into the second quarter leading up to the end of June. And then, we'll be able to obviously report more details to you in the next earnings call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, you've spoken a lot about the Medicaid impact in the Government segment business. But I was hoping, given the growth in Medicare, if you could give us a sense for how that side of the business is trending?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Chris. Thank you for asking that question. We grew our Medicare Advantage by about 38,000 members in the quarter, which was consistent with our expectations. As Joe had mentioned that we have over 50% of our membership in 4-star plans. We think we're very well positioned for future growth. We are projecting to grow that membership in the double-digit range. The marketplace that we operate in has a market average growth rate of 6% to 9% per year over the next several years, and we're looking at a low-double digit growth rate in that area.","We obviously have the agents that we'll get our fair share of over the rest of the year, and our operating margins right now are very much in line with our target margins associated with this line of business. So we actually think we're very well positioned and feel very good about our start of year in the Medicare arena.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, everybody. I'm just going to follow up a little bit more on your comments, Joe, around your PBM contract, if I could. Obviously, there seems to be a little bit of a divergence between what you're communicating today, and what was released by your current PBM earlier in the week. I wonder if there is any way to reconcile that.","And another aspect of this discussion is they put on the table $1 billion in each of the next three years plus, quote-unquote, market rates after that. Can we assume that if you're not taking that, you think you can do better than that? And then finally, on this issue, is there any update on the status of the litigation and what is happening with that? Are there any dates upcoming on the litigation with the PBM?","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Good morning, AJ. Let me take your question in the following order, dealing with, so called, reconciliation regarding what was said by ESI, the $1 billion offer, and then the litigation outlook. With respect to reconciling statements, quite frankly, that's not easy, if possible, quite frankly, because they certainly have made statements that support their perspective. We made our position very clear. We've been steady with respect to our expectations, beginning with our first declaration back in January of 2016, and I can underscore that we really have not changed our position with respect to our expectations around a $3 billion opportunity for us to recover costs that we believe we are due, relative to both our contract as well as go forward for 2020 and beyond.","So I can't speak and won't speak on behalf of ESI and their perspective, other than continually refer everyone back to what we've reportedly said and, obviously, we continue to stand by our statements. I do want to underscore and I've said this repeatedly as well that we are hopeful that we can resolve our dispute with respect to our interpretation of the agreement as well as our expectations with respect to supporting our cost structure in a more positive manner, and how that then translates to support our customers.","And however, we certainly are coming upon some very critical due dates. As I stated a moment ago, we have issued RFPs. We have stated that on an earlier call. We have followed through and issuing an RFP to many, many respondents. We expect to receive all the final details by the end of the first half of the year. And then, we'll go to the analytical phase, and then as I've said repeatedly, we will report to you in Q4 our decision, with respect to how we plan on proceeding with respect to executing on our PBM strategy, January 1, 2020 and beyond.","With respect to litigation, we are currently in discovery phase. That's really kind of, let's call it, the sum and substance of what I can report at the moment. We're expecting to complete discovery some time after mid-year. That could be pushed back, as you would expect, in litigation proceedings. So I would ask you to stay tuned in that regard. Once discovery is finished, then I think some critical dates in terms of timing on various matters related to the litigation will become clear. I do want to underscore that we're very excited about the opportunity to put together a new solution that serves our members better than our current situation.","Our teams have been focused heavily on identifying the right solution for the long term. We've talked about some possibilities in and around stated course, under a new arrangement, going in a different direction with respect to vendor support, crafting a hybrid model. We've stated all of that publicly, and we're still very focused on crafting the absolute best solution to best serve our customers.","So, we believe we have all the ingredients to keep marching forward and to give you the answers that we always declare we would give you by Q4. So, A.J., I hope I've covered up everything you wanted me to touch on. There may be other questions from others, but I think in the main, I think I've covered all of the critical aspects of where we are at the moment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. First, just let me follow up on the PBM. Joe, you mentioned you haven't ruled anybody out. Does that mean that ESRX has gotten a copy of this RFP and is participating? And then, can you talk about the hybrid model that you mentioned here in terms of what that means? And is that a reason why that even though Express may or may not be offering you interesting economics here on the short term to renew, you're looking to go in a completely different direction and, therefore, the $1 billion a year settlement here to extend wouldn't be interesting to you? And can you just verify whether you feel that they have put that offer on the table in the first place?","I apologize for the follow-up, but I think people are pretty interested.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","No. It's all one big ball of yarn, and I certainly understand how you kind of packaged it together. No problem at all. I can respond and must respond as you would expect, and I don't want to comment on any specific vendor and their engagement with respect to the RFP process, where they've chosen to participate or not participate or how that \u2013 the final submittals will look. So, again, I don't want to kind of comment on who got what. So with respect to decisions, obviously, we've not made a final decision with respect to any vendor, and I have just stated that clearly that we've not done so and we've not ruled anyone in or out. I think that covers the entire spectrum of vendor possibilities. And I will leave it at that.","With respect to the $1 billion statement, again, that's a statement that came from ESI, I really don't want to and can't obviously, for many, many reasons, talk about negotiation discussions. And I'd just come back to the point that's repeatedly said, we're hoping for an amicable resolution to our current litigation. What that might mean, with respect to engagement in our PBM strategy execution going forward, remains to be seen. But my sense is that we've got a lot of possibilities as we use the word repeatedly, I think I can underscore it here and answer your question yet again, and that's optionality.","Optionality has been a watchword for us, and I can use the word hybrid, because hybrid means kind of a mixture of possibilities around formula management, mail order, and those kinds of things that, in terms of how you manage it, may look remarkably different than constructing a contract that maybe as old as five, six, seven, eight years.","The world has changed in this space and we're certainly going to take advantage of the absolute best performance possibilities to serve our customers. I must again underscore that there has been no change to our $3 billion annual expectation for lower pharmacy costs. We are resolute on that point. We believe we've done enough analytics around market checks that we believe it's a very credible expectation, and we are holding firm on how we believe we're going to be looking at our performance for the balance in the term of agreement as well as January 1, 2010 and beyond.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I'm just trying to follow up on your guidance and the puts and takes, so I'd make sure I understood this. You beat by a significant amount, I would assume you knew about the leap day tailwind when you've guided, but your raise is $0.10. For exchanges, it's about, I guess, a little under $0.10 for every 100 basis points on margins give or take. And I'm trying to understand how much conservatism or what margins are you seeing right now, firstly, and how much potential deterioration might you expect going forward or is this mostly about the risk adjustor payment coming in less than you expect.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Sure, Ana. Thank you for the question. First of all, I'll just clarify. Leap year does not influence our 2017 outlook. Leap year was a dynamic of 2016 that caused the first quarter of 2016 to be less profitable than it would have been on a seasonality basis. So then, when you compare the seasonality of the 2016 results for the first quarter versus our first quarter of 2017, of course, our seasonality would enhance our first quarter profitability in 2017, but for the full year, it's not relevant.","In terms of the guidance, as we said, we're trying to be very prudent. I just want to be clear that the individual business is doing markedly better than it did last year. A lot of the information is consistent with expectations. The claims activity were a little bit higher to the point that as we are looking at the morbidity of the membership, it's really too early to know will our risk adjustor position be enhanced or not.","And we've taken the conservative outlook that our risk adjustor position will not be enhanced. If it is enhanced, we have upside. And so we believe that we're being appropriately prudent here with our expectations for 2017, because it is so early in the year. Very clearly, we'll have a lot more information in the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask on the commercial risk business. It sounds like enrollment is tracking ahead of expectation, and that's been a business that's seen some pressure and you mentioned strategies around that. I guess I just want to understand that a little bit more. And then, how much is it sort of market share gains, or are you seeing any shift from ASO to risk? Thanks.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Great question, Ralph. We are very pleased with the growth that we've seen in Commercial fully-insured group business, and very happy with that. There has been several things. We really went to the market with improved product designs that were received very well by the marketplace.","In terms of \u2013 really focused on price points, as you know, we've gone through several years of really fine-tuning our administrative cost and have really done a great job of growing membership and getting a great fixed cost leveraging associated with that, and allowed some of those savings to go through, in terms of more attractive price points to the membership.","We're, obviously, ensuring we offer competitive product and, given the leading provider relationships we have, and the medical management we have and, quite honestly, the number one cost of care position we have in our marketplace, we've got a great product and really very well-positioned from a competitive marketplace. In terms of what's going on with the overall market, and is it groups going from ASO to fully-insured or are we increasing share, it's really \u2013 it has a lot to do with capitalizing on a shrinking marketplace.","Joe, did you have a few other comments you wanted to add?","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question related to our engagement in the market with our provider community. I really don't want to let the moment to go by without calling out some tremendous success in and around provider collaboration. As you know, that's been a \u2013 I'd call it a hallmark of a company now for a few years and a pillar regarding our success going forward. You used the term value, and when I speak or think about value, I'm thinking about our provider collaboration engagements, such as the 159 ACOs in our markets.","We've got over 64,000 providers now engaged in ACOs, and patient-centered medical homes who are accountable for cost and quality of care for over 5.5 million commercial members, which is a huge uptick compared to prior years. It's interesting to underscore also that aggregate spend regarding value-based contracts tally up to about 58% of our total medical spend across all lines of business, and over 75% is represented by shared savings agreement, shared risk arrangements, population-based payment models. And then we've got sort of the remainder of that spread between 75% and 100% but (48:02) 58% is in various Pay for Performance arrangements.","So we're really pleased with those kinds of stats. I think it really speaks volumes regarding our shift to value-based payment models in partnership with our provider community, whether it's small group practitioners, large scale organizations like Aurora Health Care in Wisconsin. There are many, many other groups that we've aligned with, with respect to our product offerings in markets that are now delivered in tandem with our provider community. So, again, I'm very proud of that performance, and I really want to call it out because I think, again, it's a hallmark of the company's performance in all the markets we're serving.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just a two-part question. I just want to go back to guidance for a second, maybe come at it just a little bit different way. In the first quarter, earnings were up $1.22. And I know, obviously, leap year that's part of that. But for the full year, your guidance is that earnings are only up $0.60. So it implies that the combined earnings over the next three quarters are actually down. And given the increased seasonality, maybe that might be true of the fourth quarter. But just kind of wondering why that much conservatism in the remainder of the year. Is that still just primarily related to exchanges?","And then the second part is, if you're \u2013 it'd be great if you could size the retro-Iowa. But also, I didn't quite understand the comment on why the Iowa rate increase wasn't yet in the guidance.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yes. Sure, Gary. And actually, those questions, I think, can all be answered simultaneously. I appreciate the two-part question. In terms of the first quarter and how you've calculated it, a couple of other things do need to be taken into consideration versus the expectations in your analysis. Number one, we did have the change in the treatment of the taxes associated with stock-based compensation that we implemented in the first quarter of 2017. So that was certainly additive as a one-time catch-up or true-up associated with adopting that accounting principle.","And then, the second part is the retro-Iowa true-up. We really cannot go into specific dollar amounts associated with it, other than to say that that retro payment was reimbursement for a portion of the losses that we experienced in 2016 under that contract. We continue to work with the state to obtain actuary justified rates as of July 1. As those negotiations are ongoing, it really would be premature and inappropriate to comment on them publicly, other than to say that we want to be very cautious in terms of what we're including in our outlook associated with the overall situation there.","So, we've again tried to be very prudent in terms of how we're looking at that. And as you look at the metrics that you rattled off, we have a prudent approach to Individual. We have a continued margin pressure in our Medicaid expansion business that we've been signaling for quite some time. It's actually very much in line with expectations, but it is a real issue. And then the seasonality of the leap year, I think, are all significant metrics that need to be taken into consideration, when you do the math that you did.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning. So, my question is on the remaining timeline and legal strategy around the Cigna transaction. So, first, if you lose the appeal decision, is that the definitive end? Or is there any last minute hope for a DOJ settlement? And if you do win the appeal, if you're still waiting on the court, when you get to that May 8 hearing, is it your intention to ask the judge to keep the injunction in place to hold Cigna to the agreement beyond the April 30 expiration?","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you very much for the question. Obviously, like you, we're kind of trying to evaluate our options depending on which way the court goes, which we believe the decision is relatively imminent with respect to the Appeals Court. And to underscore what you said, the Delaware Chancery will be convening on May 8, so there's still a lot of judicial proceedings to occur.","In assessing that, we believe the Appeals Court \u2013 probably I'm telling you something you already know, but there are probably about three directions it can go in, which would be: to just categorically deny our appeal across the board; and another would be to accept it but in part, remand some of it back to the District Court; and then the final one, obviously, would be to accept our appeal in its entirety and have us move forward.","So each one of those requires very significant discernment on the choices that we have and I'd probably leave any further commentary regarding our choices to another time, when it becomes clear what the court's decision is. So I really don't want to speak exactly to what we can or can't do relative to each one of the decisions.","Regarding the Chancery Court, obviously, how it evaluates the situation is dependent on the appeals outcome. And so, I guess, long story short, we're going to have to judge our go forward position based on the decision by the Appeals Court. And then, obviously, make the best choice possible for us, but I do want to underscore that we are continually committed to the acquisition both with respect to the board and management. And we are proceeding with all the effort necessary to come to a reasonably good outcome regarding our commitment to the acquisition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Just two clarifications. First, I just want to make sure I understood on Iowa. Are you including a rate increase for July 1 in the guidance? And then the second question was, I think, I heard Joe talk a little bit about the long-term EPS growth rate of that high-single digit to low-double digit. Did I hear sort of a change towards the higher end? Is that something you're more comfortable with now? Or are you guys sort of shifting your thoughts on long-term EPS growth? Thanks.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","This is Joe. I'll respond just very quickly. No, you didn't hear anything that's any different than the first comment we made with respect to high-single digit, low-double digit expectations. So, John, do you want to pick it up from here?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. So, the first part of your question, Josh, was on Iowa. And our plan has all along been to receive actuarially justified rate increases as of July 1. We still believe we're entitled to those and we're working very closely with the state in order to achieve those.","However, as I commented, the first quarter of 2017 benefited from this one-time retro premium adjustment. We are very cautious to include it, and a full actuarially justified rate increase on July 1 in our guidance or in our outlook. We believe we're entitled to it. But until we have more clarity, we don't want to get out ahead of the negotiations. But our original expectations all along have been July 1 actuarially sound rates.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","John, I probably need to add some commentary to the question about high-single digit, low-double digit expectation on long-term growth. We do have our strategies that we are targeting, and I think it really is important to underscore that those strategies are targeted at Government Business, as you know, with respect to both Medicaid\/Medicare.","We've talked liberally about our Medicare outlook, particularly in terms of organic growth and combined with M&A opportunity. Our Commercial Business had a lot of targeted opportunities, particularly in the area of increased wallet share in and around specialty offerings to the market, and then membership gains and a variety of places.","Our SG&A expense controls we believe will be a key contributor with respect to the operational improvements we believe are possible, as we better adapt to the marketplace, and also be able to effectively leverage our growth in membership based on very prudent and highly efficient application of our expenses.","And then, finally \u2013 and I'll let John speak to this with respect to capital deployment choices that we have ahead of us. I can't leave out the PBM repricing process as well. So, in any event, we've got a very significant combined effort, a variety of opportunities that we think will take us to point of meeting the expectations that I stated last call, as well as this call. I don't know, John, if you want to add anything.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah, no, thank you, Joe. On the capital allocation, that clearly \u2013 the capital planning structure, that clearly was part of our high-single to low-double digit thought process as we go through and evaluate future M&A opportunities, share buyback opportunities, other ways to return capital to shareholders through dividends, getting an appropriate balance of all those things we think are critically important.","And I just want to reemphasize, when we say high-single to low-double that is a long term view over many, many years. And obviously, some years, it can be at the lower end and some years it can be at the higher end. So any one year is not indicative of what a long-term multi-year view might be, and we are very comfortable given our strategy, given our track record and given our growth prospects, that we can achieve high-single to low-double on average over a multi-year period.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","You know what, I think, John, just to reinforce something I said at the very beginning of my commentary, and that is internally, we are looking very carefully at our operational performance, trying to understand the transformative responsibilities we have to better manage the company in terms of supporting our business model. And in particular, now, as you've just heard, related to these strategic initiatives that we have targeted, it's not just about the pieces of the puzzle we just described, but also how we then support each part of that puzzle being accomplished with respect to our go-forward success that we envision, so a lot of internal shifts and changes with respect to better performing in support of our strategic commitment.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. And I hate to end it and going back to the PBM, but I just want to try to continue to reconcile the differences in your statements and ESI's. You've talked about needing to get that $3 billion or believing you're owed the $3 billion in annual savings. Express has shared numbers and suggested that they can't give you $3 billion in incremental savings. So, is that really what's causing the difference in terms of their view of what you've said to them and your view of saying it's open to everybody? Is it really only open to everybody to the extent you get $3 billion in savings?","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Well, appreciate you bringing it back to the table, and hope you can appreciate my comeback, which I've repeatedly stated, which is we stand by our $3 billion expectation. And, quite frankly, we believe that's at a minimum $3 billion based on the analytics, market check performance that we've administered now over quite a lengthy period of time, and so our outlook at January 1, 2020 and beyond is very much guided by that reality.","And as such, obviously, we're driven by our focus on creating value for our members and our shareholders. And you may recall what we said repeatedly is that about 20% of that pickup, and improvement is going to flow to the shareholders. Conversely, it's going to be 80% going to our members. So, it's a huge nut that we believe needs to be cracked for the benefit of so many. And I understand your question with respect to the $1 billion. But again, that's their number, and I really don't want to comment on their analytics, why they believe, what they believe.","I know that all of you are very focused on applying the math to their numbers, as you do our numbers. And I'll just have to leave it at that, and let them speak for themselves, and I certainly respect where they're coming from. But obviously, we have a different point of view, and we believe it's a point of view that's validated by the statistics that have flowed out of our analytics. So we stand by our position and the negotiating process with respect to litigation we're in. I really don't want to comment on that either because there is some sanctity related to the litigation process through discovery and beyond. And I think the prudent approach is simply enough to comment on any matters of litigation.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Okay. Well, thank you for all your questions. As always, it's great to hear from you and get an appreciation for what's on your mind relative to what we've reported on for the quarter. As you know, this company is committed to running our healthcare systems challenges. We're focused on expanding access to high quality affordable healthcare for all of our customers.","And I also want to thank our associates for their continued commitment to serving our 40.6 million members every day. Thanks for your interest in Anthem, and we look forward to speaking with you soon at upcoming conferences. Again, thanks for dialing in and look forward to seeing you in the future.

Welcome to the Anthem Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the company\u2019s management.","Chris Rigg","Good morning, and welcome to Anthem\u2019s fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division.","Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our fourth quarter financial results, followed by commentary around our focus on execution and our enterprise-wide growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail and go over our 2019 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call.","Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Gail.","Gail Boudreaux","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Anthem's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning, we reported strong fourth quarter results and 2019 financial guidance above the expectation we conveyed in October.","Our 2018 results and 2019 expectations demonstrate accelerated top line momentum, strong medical cost performance and disciplined expense management. In 2018, we made significant progress reorienting Anthem for growth and improving the overall execution of the enterprise.","We understand that we play an important societal role. Our mission improving lives and communities, simplifying health care, and expecting more drives our aspiration. Corporate responsibility is integral to our success as a company. And as such we were proud to be named to the 2018 Dow Jones Sustainability Index for our work to empower community, improve the sustainability of our business, operate with integrity and advance and inclusive workplace.","In the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.61 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.44, representing growth of 89% year-over-year. For the full year, GAAP earnings per share was $14.19 and adjusted earnings per share was $15.89, up 32% compared to 2017 and approximately 6% above our initial 2018 expectation. Our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results are evidence that the actions we have taken since late 2017 to improve operational execution are gaining traction.","Anthem's fourth quarter operating revenue grew 3.8% over the prior year quarter to $23.3 billion. Revenue in our Government Business increased more than 16% over the fourth quarter 2017 and more than offset the planned reduction in our Individual business. Administrative fees and other revenue increased more than 9% over the prior year quarter reflecting our focus on improving our offerings through cost effective specialty products and clinical engagement programs.","Our fourth quarter medical cost performance was strong with balanced results in both our Commercial and Government businesses. Of note, performance in the Government Business normalized in the fourth quarter and tracked slightly better than we expected. Commercial results remained strong with trends consistent with recent quarters. Year-end membership adjusted for the delayed launch of the Minnesota Medicaid partnership exceeded our expectation.","Looking ahead, we intend to accelerate investment and strategically important capability, AI, digital, clinical integration, and provider collaboration, simplifying health care for those we serve and strengthening the impact we have on the health care ecosystem. Last week, Anthem together with several other payers PNC and IBM announced a new collaboration to create a health utility network using block chain technology to improve transparency and interoperability in the health care industry. We view block chain as an enabler for establishing trust. Timely access to medical information has been a stumbling block for creating a seamless consumer experience.","With a trusted foundation based on transparency and cryptography, we will provide a faster, safer, and more secure way to exchange medical information to transform the delivery of health care. Anthem Whole Health Connection connects medical, pharmacy, dental, vision, and disability clinical and claims data to improve member's overall health, well-being, and cost of care. This clinically integrated model is producing tangible results.","During 2018, 1.2 million specialty gaps in care were communicated and closed. Through Whole Health Connection, we have been able to lower emergency room visits and inpatient hospital stays by 8%, reduced the number of dental opioid prescriptions by 40%, and identified more than 130,000 members with high-risk health conditions through routine eye exams.","Our CareMore business has evolved from its Medicare Advantage root to build clinical models that support high-risk commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid patients. CareMore physicians and clinical teams provide continuity of care across contracted hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, CareMore clinical care centers, and home, intensive disease management program that incorporate consideration of social determinants [indiscernible] such as loneliness and transportation focus on prevention and better management of chronic disease. These clinical models and programs translate into lower rates of hospital admission.","In Tennessee, for example, the Medicaid CareMore reduced behavioral health-related readmission from 40% in 2016 [ph] to 13% in 2018. Accelerating provider collaboration and improving value and outcomes for our members, our enhanced personal health care programs now includes 166 accountable care organizations and 67,000 providers. In our EPHC Essentials program, we have enrolled nearly 3,000 primary care providers, doubling participation since the end of 2017. The Essentials program designed for providers who have smaller membership populations, broadens the reach of our collaborative effort, and improves the customer experience for our members.","Approximately 64% of our total medical spend is tied to payment innovation program, including performance-based contracts and our leading market share makes us the partner of choice for the provider community. By leveraging our technology, clinical engagement and collaborative provider model, together with the strength of the Blue brand, we expect to deliver differentiated medical costs and outcome.","Today, we announced we will accelerate the implementation of IngenioRx, our pharmacy benefits provider. The launch now scheduled for the second quarter of 2019 is a key milestone in the realization of our vision and strategy. IngenioRx will improve our ability to integrate pharmacy benefits within our already strong medical and specialty platform, driving greater value for the consumer and increasing transparency.","The accelerated implementation comes after significant preparation and testing. Anthem and CVS Health have been working closely to plan every detail of this transition. To date, we have completed more than 15 months to preparation against our transition goal. The results of our operational testing have been very positive, giving us confidence in our readiness to launch. And we believe an acceleration is in the best interest of Anthem's customers and members. We continue to expect IngenioRx to deliver at least $4 billion of gross pharmaceutical savings annually once our transition has been completed in 2020, with at least 20% accruing to our shareholders.","Our earnings per share outlook of greater than $18 per share on a GAAP basis and greater than $19 per share on an adjusted basis reflects strong growth across all business lines and the partial year contribution from the accelerated implementation of IngenioRx.","On a core basis, before the contribution from the accelerated PBM implementation, we estimate EPS growth at the high end of our upper-single digit to low-double digit, long-term EPS growth range. The core growth expected in 2019 is a testament to the overall strength of the enterprise, given the challenges we have faced with our pharmacy cost structure. Our expectations for 2019 include robust total membership growth of 1.2 million members at the midpoint of our guidance, including solid year-over-year improvement in our Commercial group fully insured segment.","Our group Medicare business will achieve our January membership target of 150,000 members. Our individual Medicare Advantage business is on track to achieve our mid-double-digit growth target. In total, we estimate our Medicare Advantage growth will exceed 20% by the end of 2019. Medicaid membership is expected to grow in the upper-single-digit range including the launch of the Minnesota partnership and organic growth in existing states.","Our 2019 outlook does not assume potential new business wins. As expected, the Minnesota Medicaid partnership went live on January 1. We also anticipate mid-single-digit Commercial fully insured membership growth, a substantial improvement relative to our performance in 2018.","The improved sales execution reflects our investments and new products such as Act Wise are fully integrated consumer driven health plan and spending account solution. Currently, more than 800,000 subscribers and 9,000 employer groups utilize Act Wise. Anthem Health Guide, our concierge service model that integrates Anthem's telephone and digital channel, clinical program and predictive modeling is accelerating our commercial growth.","In 2018 Anthem Health Guide membership grew by 1.1 million members and we successfully implemented this support model for another 90,000 clients, representing 900,000 members in the small group marketplace on January 1. With over 6.3 million members today Anthem Health Guide is enhancing the member experience by providing a seamless transition between member service and the Anthem Care team.","Overall, we improved enterprise execution during 2018 and we entered 2019 with growing momentum in our key business segments. We remain committed to investing in capabilities and technologies that enhance the consumer experience and reduce the burden of health care inflation. We vary unique responsibility to society and meeting our financial commitments rest firmly in our ability to put the interest of our consumers first.","I will now pass the call over to John for more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial performance and 2019 guidance. ","John Gallina","Thank you, Gail and good morning. As Gail mentioned, our fourth quarter 2018 results came in ahead of expectations, and we entered 2019 position for growth. Fourth quarter 2018 GAAP earnings per share was $1.61 and adjusted earnings per share was $2.44. For the full year 2018 GAAP earnings per share was $14.19 and adjusted earnings per share was $15.89 representing growth of 32% over 2017.","The results were above our targeted long-term growth range due to better-than-expected core performance and the impact of tax reform. We are confident we can sustain this momentum in 2019 as we expect core earnings per share growth excluding the impact of IngenioRx to be at the upper end of our long-term EPS growth range.","As disclosed in our press release this morning, we made a number of changes to our reporting in an effort to better align our reported membership and financials to the appropriate segments and funding arrangements. In order to remain as transparent as possible, we have included restated membership and financials for the past two years in this morning's press release to facilitate comparisons of our fourth quarter reporting to that of prior periods.","Total medical membership ended the year at 39.9 million members reflecting an increase of 37,000 members in the fourth quarter. Compared to year-end 2017, membership declined by 361,000, primarily due to our reduced participation in certain individual ACA-compliant markets.","Please note that our individual membership declined by 933,000 members, which means that our other lines of business grew a collective 572,000 members during 2018. Operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $23.3 billion, an increase of $857 million or 3.8% over the fourth quarter 2017. The growth in operating revenue was driven by increases in premiums across our business to cover overall cost trends and the return of the health insurer fee in 2018.","Our acquisitions with HealthSun and America\u2019s 1st Choice and strong organic growth in our Medicare and fee-based businesses. The revenue growth comes despite a 59% reduction in our individual membership. Our medical loss ratio for the fourth quarter was 86.8%, a decrease of 180 basis points from the prior year quarter, which as expected was driven primarily by the return of the health insurer fee in 2018. However, when normalizing for the impact of the health insurer fee, our medical loss ratio has improved from the prior year, highlighting our commitment to improving medical cost performance.","The fourth quarter 2018 SG&A ratio is 15.5%, 40 basis points higher than the fourth quarter 2017, driven by the return of the health insurer fee in 2018, as this increases our costs. Had it not been for the impact of the health insurer fee, our SG&A ratio would have been improved in the prior year quarter reflecting our continued focus on administrative efficiency. Operating cash flow for the full year 2018 was $3.8 billion and was slightly greater than net income, but was slightly below expectations.","Our fourth quarter and 2018 cash flow was negatively impacted by the timing of the payments from several state Medicaid programs, where our premium payments are now a month in arrears. Normalizing further delays, we are pleased with our 2018 cash flow performance, which included a headwind of approximately $500 million related to the claims payments on the runoff of the individual businesses we exited.","Our days in claims payable was 36.2 days in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of 2.5 days from the 38.7 days we recorded in the third quarter and a decrease of 3.2 days as compared to the prior year quarter. This decrease was expected and was driven by a purposeful decision to reduce claims inventory ahead of a significant January 1 systems migration by improvements in claims, auto adjudication rates and membership mix.","We continued to focus on improving our claims process and systems, ultimately leading to faster claims payment cycle times. As a result, we believe our days and claims payable will continue to trend in the mid to high 30s.","Now to our 2019 guidance. Before I begin, it's important to note that our 2019 outlook includes the partial year impact of the accelerated implementation of IngenioRx, which we announced today. We expect to migrate members beginning in the second quarter with migrations back-loaded into the second half of 2019 and into the first quarter of 2020.","The accelerated launch positions us to transition all of our membership by the first quarter of 2020, a full year ahead of our prior schedule. The accelerated launch will produce incremental operating gain in 2019.","The net benefit we expect in 2019 reflects the impact of pass-through pricing, medical loss ratio rebates and competitively appropriate pricing actions. As we have noted in the past, the net benefit to Anthem is derived on a market-by-market, product-by-product basis creating a non-linear relationship between transitioning membership and profit retention. We are pleased to have upside in 2019, but even more excited to achieve virtually a full year run rate savings beginning in 2020.","In 2020, we continue to estimate the gross savings of at least $4 billion, with greater than 20% falling through the operating gain. For the full year 2019, we expect operating revenues to grow to approximately $100 billion or 9.5%, reflecting overall membership growth and mixed shift, premier rate increases to cover overall medical cost trends and the launch of IngenioRx. These will partially be offset by the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium in 2019.","As Gail mentioned, in total, we are expecting membership growth of 1 million to 1.4 million members, which includes growth across all of our key business segments. In the Commercial business, we project our fully insured enrollment will grow by approximately 150,000 to 300,000 members. Most of this growth is in our fully insured group business, where we are improving our sales force effectiveness, while remaining disciplined on our pricing.","We are continuing to participate strategically in the individual ACA marketplace. In our Medicaid business, we expect to add approximately 450,000 to 550,000 lives, reflecting the members we added for our newly launched Minnesota partnership as well as organic growth in our existing markets. During the year, we also expect to be active participants in various RFPs.","Within our Medicare business, we're projecting growth of approximately 250,000 to 350,000 members including Medicare Advantage growth in the 200,000 to 250,000 range in both individual and group product offerings. We were pleased with our performance during the annual enrollment period. And consistent with 2018, we expect robust individual enrollment growth over the balance of 2018.","Turning to the financial metrics. The one year suspension of the health insurer fee in 2019 impacts all of our major financial metrics such that comparison to 2018 on a reported basis will be distorted. We expect our 2019 consolidated medical loss ratio to be 86.2% at the midpoint, an increase of 200 basis points versus 2018, largely driven by the health insurer fee moratorium normalizing for the impact of the health insurer fee our 2019 MLR guidance is roughly flat compared to 2018 reflecting improved performance in our Medicaid business offset by margin normalization in our Individual business and strong growth in Medicare Advantage.","The company expects Local Group medical cost trend will be in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points in 2019. We expect our SG&A ratio in 2019 to be 13.5% at the midpoint, a decrease of 180 basis points as compared to 2018 largely due to the impact of the one year health insurer fee moratorium. Normalizing for the impact of the health insurer fee, we estimate the SG&A ratio will decline slightly due to our strong revenue growth aided in part by our launch of IngenioRx.","We do expect to continue investing in our business at a similar level to 2018 as we build out our digital, clinical and consumer-facing capabilities. Below the line, we expect investment income of approximately $1 billion in interest expense of approximately $800 million. We also expect our tax rate to be in the range of 19.5% to 21.5% for the year, reflecting both our continued focus on strategic tax planning as well as the impact of the one year suspension of the non-deductible health insurer fee.","Operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $5.2 billion in 2019. Our 2019 outlook assumes balanced capital deployment, as we seek to optimize return of capital with the investments necessary to drive long-term growth and margin improvement. Our 2019 guidance includes baseline share purchases of $1 billion, leading to an average fully diluted share count for the year in the range of 261 million to 263 million shares. Taken together, we see 2019 GAAP earnings per share of greater than $18 per share and adjusted earnings of a greater than $19 per share.","We do not give quarterly guidance, but the launch of IngenioRx will impact our normal seasonal earnings patterns. Given the launch, we would expect slightly over half of our adjusted earnings in the first half of 2019. We intend to provide a more detailed up-to-date on the impact of IngenioRx and our longer-term growth projection at our March 7 Investor Conference.","Operator, we'll now open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Thanks. Hi, everybody. I guess, I'll ask about the Ingenio transition. Do you have good visibility on how you're going to bring customers over? Do they have any say as to when they will be converted?","And what will the impact of this be to them, will they feel this or is it designed to be transparent to them? And do they get any benefit from making the transition right away, even if they aren\u2019t currently under contract?","Gail Boudreaux","Great. Good morning, A.J. and thank you for the question. First is, as you saw in our announcement in our prepared comments, we're excited to begin moving forward with our transition of the IngenioRx. I think one of the important things that we wanted to share is while we've been in intense preparation with CVS Health over the last 15 months, we really had two years to work through this transition since the original announcement and that's pretty standard.","We're feeling very confident about our testing and the significant work. And as we've shared before, the team that we have is very expert [ph] in doing that. Specifically to your question about transition schedule, we will begin the migration in the second quarter of 2019. Clearly, we will be working with our customers on the appropriate schedule and have mapped out some of that schedule. But I think it's important to note that we are going to be working with our customers. And our customers will see value upon conversion to the new platform.","So we think that there's a significant opportunity to drive meaningful value for them in terms of affordability as well as the member and consumer experience. That's an area that we've invested in heavily. And we also believe that that's an area that they will see some immediate impact in terms of the integration, not just of our pharmacy, but of our full health approach with our clinical and case managers as well as our pharmacies.","So overall, we have a very. I think thoughtful transition filling in. We feel very confident about it. Our team has been in intense testing on that plan, but we also recognized that this is something that we will be actively working with our customers on through that process. Thank you very much for the question. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. I want to stay on the PBM, a couple of questions here. First, Gail, you mentioned that you saw the core business ex the PBM at the higher end of your typical kind of target EPS range. So I just assumed low single -- low double-digit is 12%, so the $15.90 at 12% growth gets to me to about $17.80 and the other $1.20 of EPS is about $400 million pre-tax.","So just want to confirm that you're getting about half of that $800 million of savings in 2019. And then beyond that, can you just talk about what -- like do you have a timing set out in terms of which businesses shift first, can you share with us -- is it Part D first and then Medicaid, and then Commercial or reversed?","And then, just talk about the EPS benefit, but how much of the $4 billion are you getting? And when are you pricing that through. Are you seeing some of the benefit there in Commercial and like does that mean the membership in Commercial is going to be back-end loaded? So, I know a bunch of questions under there, but hoping you can kind of help us with that. Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","Well, thanks, Justin. There's a lot of questions there, so I'll try to get through all of them and address it. First and foremost, thank you for the question. And also for recognizing, both the strong momentum that we end 2018, but also the strong momentum that we see on our core business.","As I said in my comments, this will be at the high end of our guidance range that we've given historically, and there's a couple of things driving that. One, first and foremost, we see really strong robust membership growth across every one of our businesses. I think we also feel very confident in what we've done in terms of medical cost and strong administrative expense management.","As you think about the PBM and the timing of our business, there are number of questions there. And again, I'll go back to sort of the opening comments that I made and that I shared about that, this is a non-linear transition. So as you think about that we will begin in the second quarter. Certainly, there will be a different timing on business just to give you one example Medicare Advantage will not convert until 1, 1 of 2020. So that gives you some perspective on that.","We're not going to go into the specific schedule for each and every business at this stage. As I shared my with my earlier comments with A.J., we have a schedule. We are also working with our clients on that schedule, so we want to make sure our first and foremost priority is a smooth transition.","We do think there's significant value for customers and we also think that this additional transparency that customers will see as part of this is a strong part of our value proposition. I think I'm going to ask John to answer the remainder of your questions, if we have them all. I think I answered about two of the four. So I'll ask John maybe to comment on the other components.","John Gallina","Thank you, Gail, and thank you Justin for the question. Yes, I think in terms of the guidance, we don't provide the specificity of earnings on the line of business basis or exactly how much the contribution from IngenioRx is. But let me walk through the logic that we have in terms of getting to the guidance. It's very similar to the way that you characterize your question. You know what, we did in 2018 at $15.89 and admittedly that included better tax rate than was assumed in 2018 and even slightly stronger investment income. However, that is our starting point, which does signify sustainability of those below the line items as well as a very strong core operating growth.","Then as we go into 2019, we do have the tailwind from the moratorium on the health insurer fee, we disclosed 90 days ago that's about $0.40 that certainly is unchanged. And so we've now included that in our starting point as well as additive number to the $15.89. And then with the bias to the high end of the high single to low double-digit long-term growth rate that had previously been announced. And so you work through all that math, and then you take the difference between that and the $19. Well, that is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the partial year for Ingenio. But as Gail said, it\u2019s a non-linear transition. The Medicare Advantage business is all January 1 of 2020 on our current timeline. So it's really difficult to run rate something like that.","But we are very bullish on the $4 billion, which is the other part of your question. The way the $4 billion is constructed today might be a little bit different than it was constructed two years ago when we made the announcement. But it's still good. And we still feel -- we will reaffirm the fact that when we go onto the new CVS contract on a run rate basis that there is greater than $4 billion worth of savings that were one more to our customers and we will reaffirm that fact that our expectations are is that greater than 20% gets return to shareholders, which means that nearly 80% goes to our customers in terms of more affordable health care costs.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from SVP Leerink. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, again congrats on IngenioRx and following through on that line of questioning. I was asking about the $3.2 billion in savings that you're not following to the bottom line and how's that interplaying with your employer segment turned around?","It sounds like this year at least 150 to 300k membership is on sales force effectiveness not on pricing, but you have all of this dry powder on medical cost. So will that start to drive share gains through more affordability in 2020? Are you seeing some of that in maybe the July second half of 2019 selling season?","Gail Boudreaux","All right. Thank you for the question, Ana. First, thanks for recognizing. I think we do feel that we have a very robust membership growth guidance in 2019, and again the positive impact of the IngenioRx is embedded in that guidance. That being said, first of all, we are very pleased with the early January results that we are seeing in the sales cycle.","And I'll ask Pete to comment a little bit about works that he\u2019s done -- it's been done in our Commercial sector, because we are seeing our Commercial risk business both in large and small group grow in January of 2019. And as John shared, our pricing has reflected ESI contract but also stayed very disciplined in that pricing. So we see this contract certainly adding value to our consumers, but we also see it solidifying and giving us even greater confidence in the 2019 goals that we've laid out as well as I think some momentum going into 2020.","Maybe Pete, can comment a little bit about the work that he's done in Commercial, because I think he started to see the momentum at the end of 2018 and clearly in the 2019 guidance.","Pete Haytaian","Yeah. Sure. Thanks very much, Gail. Thanks for the question and I appreciate you recognizing our growth in the quarter and the improvements we're making. And I'll be a little bit more specific, I'm personally very pleased with respect to where we are on the journey.","As you know, we've talked about that number one infusing much greater talent into the organization and I think we've gotten a lot of that behind us. We certainly are putting great talent at the executive levels as well as on the field. I am very pleased with that. We went through a reorganization as we've talked about in terms of our segment strategy as well as our centers of excellence made great progress there. Our centers of excellence again remember focused on product, on pricing, on organization like stop-loss, on our Group Retiree business. And we really pivoted quite frankly now focusing much more on execution and growth.","And very pleased as Gail said, with the progress that we've made in the fourth quarter, you can see from the results and from our remarks we're very focused on growing the groups fully insured business. We saw that play through in the fourth quarter. In fact, we saw growth while modest occur across all our lines of business. And we're seeing that momentum play through into January as a Gail said.","With a keen focus on our group fully insured business, we are very pleased with the progress there as well as across of the lines of business. In addition to that remained focus on expanding our margins for example in the ASO business and seeing progress there. So I'm very pleased across the board to see positive momentum. I think, think will play through into 2019 and as Gail noted, certainly with now the addition of IngenioRx it just creates further momentum into the future.","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks, Pete. And I think as Pete as said, performance execution and growth are two areas that we have been very focusing on across Anthem and we're starting to see the results of that, feel that we still have opportunity to continue to refine that, but I feel very good about our early start to 2019. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Stevens. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to drill in a bit to group MA and just get an update from you on how the strategy there is developing, looking out to 2020 and in terms of the sales pipeline that you're building. And then also just, how the initiatives are progressing around, partnering with other Blues around further capitalizing on the group MA opportunity? Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","Great. Thanks, Scott. I'm going to ask Pete to comment on that. Thank you.","Pete Haytaian","Yeah. Thanks for that question. I think you know from our prior comments that we started 2018 quite frankly with at or around 25,000 members. And again, on a journey to improve that, obviously the great work that Felicia and Marc Russo have done in establishing a very small foundation for the Medicare Advantage business was number one.","Then, we were focused on talent and building the infrastructure around Group Retiree. And that is played out through the year, where coming into 2019, we talked about starting the year with approximately 150,000 members. So, a nice leap from the 125,000 members that we started at.","With respect to your specific question on the pipeline, we're encouraged by what we're seeing. I think we've talked about this in the past, what's really I think differentiating about Anthem quite frankly is our embedded pipeline. And I'll be more specific, we sort of look at it in a few buckets. Bucket number one are those Commercial members and clients that we have today that have a Commercial Medicare relationship with us i.e. a Commercial Medicare warp benefit.","Bucket number two are those clients we have a commercial relationship with the Commercial only. They are currently with our competitors on the Group Retiree side, so that obviously lends an opportunity. And then, not directly associated with the Group Retiree opportunity, but our agent opportunity which is sizable.","Those three buckets are in the several millions in terms of prospects and that's why we're encouraged by our pipeline. And then, finally with respect to your question on partnerships. Obviously, we've proven ourselves with respect to partnerships in the Medicaid side and that continues to evolve. It is an opportunity on the Medicare side, while we continue to work on that. It evolve, but preliminarily, we actually are working on one relationship in fact. I think we'll build upon that as our Group Retiree business builds.","Gail Boudreaux","Yes. Thank you, Pete. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Yeah. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about cross-sell progress in the self-insured business? And I was interested in how was looking for your one-one in 2019. And in addition, on the PBM side of this given the earlier migration, is that something where you're going to be focusing on cross-sells of PBM in 2019 or are you going to wait till you migrate and really that's 2020 and beyond sort of opportunity?","Gail Boudreaux","Great. Thanks again for the question, Lance. And again, I\u2019ll have Pete respond as part of the Commercial business.","Pete Haytaian","Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. I think it's a great question. Yeah, we are making good progress as it relates to the cross-sell opportunity in expanding our ASO margins. I think a proof point quite frankly is if you look at our quarter-over-quarter earnings, you see our administrative fees and revenue rising. So that\u2019s a good proof point I think about by 9%.","And importantly, our local markets and then our specialty organization as it relates to our specialty products are deeply connected. And I continue to see very good progress with respect to the upsell and cross-sell opportunity. So all the metrics that we are looking at are moving in the right direction.","In addition to that, as it relates to January 1 and the progress we're making, obviously not going to talk about numbers at this point, but I think you'll see that flow through in our Q1 result in terms of great progress. On the specialty side and growth on the specialty side, specifically, in up-selling, cross-selling.","But in addition to that, and again, it's not only limited to specialty products, we really excited about the up-sell opportunity of things like stop-loss. Our clinical packages which were making progress on as well as some of our shared savings and incentive programs. And then, finally, to your point Lance, yes, pharmacy does play an integral role and ultimately us going from the 5 to 1 to 3 to 1. And so in the future that will be a component of our strategy in terms of delivering greater margin in the ASO business.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you, Pete and Lance. Just to clarify one thing, as you think about our 2019 guidance, our focus on the PBM has really been on the transition and ensuring that that goes smoothly for our customers and driving maximum value. So we did not include a lot of new PBM business in our guidance. So, anything there would be additive as we've announced the new contract we would be putting new business on that. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Windley","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So in your guidance you mentioned that the $19 includes or absorbs any transition costs for the IngenioRx transition. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of that is.","And maybe on the other side, are there are some CVS credits that are subsidizing that? Just curious how much costs you're absorbing there? And then just a clarification on an earlier comment. John talked about disciplined pricing in Commercial group, but I also thought there were some reference to maybe invoking some of the PBM savings into that pricing paradigm for 2019, did I understand that correctly or not? Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","John, have your response please.","John Gallina","Yes. Sure. No, thanks, Dave. In terms of the \u2013 if I get your questions appropriately here. But in terms of the costs associated with transition and the CVS credits, the contract we have with CVS is confidential and I\u2019m really not at liberty to disclose the contractual provisions there. And associated with our cost or our additional costs, we're incurring associated with the transition. We've netted those out as part of the $19. It's really not a run rate issue because the benefits we get are going to be non-linear associated with when the business is being transitioned.","So it's really not anything that's all that meaningful from a year-over-year perspective. It's a one-time cost structure and then the benefits here in 2019 are really one-time, just given the timing of the transition. Associated with the pricing, so just to be clear, every member that migrates to the new contract will see value. And all see value in slightly different ways, but certainly groups that are renewing will be on the new contract and so the pricing that we have associated with the renewals will be reflected based on our better PBM contract. And we do want to be opportunistic associated with new business as well to ensure that we're reflecting the most appropriate price point in terms of our growth trajectory. So hopefully that addresses your questions.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Zack Sopcak from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Zack Sopcak","Hey, thanks for the question. I just want to ask about operating cash flow in 2019 guidance. It looks like you're implying about a 1.1 times net income which is an improvement over this year. Is that being driven by IngenioRx coming in-house? Or is there anything else? And then, as you look forward 2020 would you expect that to continue to trend upward? Thank you.","John Gallina","Thanks Zach. I appreciate the question. And actually the opportunity to clarify although \u2013 there is one item in our numbers that are a little messy for 2018, it is the cash flow and some of the related metrics. So you have to actually go back to 12\/31\/17 when we made the cognizant decision to exit 60% of the individual ACA marketplace and we paid up to $0.5 billion of claims of run out on the business that we walked away from in 2018.","So that certainly artificially lowered the metrics associated with cash flow, even with that $0.5 billion of payments that we made our cash flow from operations still 1.0 times our net income, it was just slightly higher than net income. So underlying results were very positive cash flow, then we had a couple of other things occur, we do have some Medicaid states that were now a month in arrears on payments and that \u2013 it certainly impacting our cash flow.","And then, even most importantly, in December, to help prepare for a system migration we made a conscious decision to accelerate claims payment in December related to those migrating members. Yeah, the acceleration helped reduce the risk of migration, but also negatively impacted cash flow and reduced our days in claims payable metrics simultaneously.","Yeah. So when you take all that together actually $3.8 billion and 1.0 times net income is actually very strong, once you take all the other impact in simultaneously. And we feel very good about the fact that our cash flow of $5.2 billion for 2019 is strong and it's really not driven specifically by Ingenio as much as is just strong core operating growth.","Gail Boudreaux","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. You've talked about expanding Commercial product offerings to include more low-cost and narrow network options. Can you talk about the traction you're seeing on these new offerings for 2019? And how we should think about the price point variation from historical PMPM?","Gail Boudreaux","Sure. I shared a few of my comments in my opening remarks, but I'll ask Pete to give a \u2013 go into a little bit more detail about the portfolio products that we've added to the market over the last year and the continuing work that we're doing there. Pete?","Pete Haytaian","Yeah. No. I think it's a great question. It's one of those areas that the segment \u2013 in the segment strategy and in our centers of excellence around product really focused on. And that's \u2013 that's make sure you have a portfolio of products to meet the affordability needs of all clients and so very much focused on crafting those products from Association health plans, to level funded products, to chamber-based products that we're working on.","We began to roll those out in a much more robust way at the end of the year and we are seeing that play through into 2019. We're seeing decent progress with respect to that. And we think we'll continue to see that evolve further. Some of these product offerings, obviously to your point are connected to higher performing networks.","As it relates to a price differential, it varies. I'm not going to give you a specific number but it's a big part of the equation, right, providing choice and affordability to our client base. And so I think it's a great question. I think you'll see that continue to progress in 2019 and 2020.","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks, Pete. The only thing I'd add to Pete's comments, I think in addition sort of to the product design elements, we are very intentional in how we are managing our strong network relationships. I talked a little bit about our enhanced personal health care, our movement to value-based payment.","So I think our preferred relationships with care providers in the market given our market share the Commercial team specifically has been really integrating that with our clinical programs. So I think you're seeing -- you're starting to see some early traction from that and our commitment to really aligning a whole host of affordability choices, because our goal coming into 2019 was to give employers option. And I think that was one of the areas that I shared early in 2018. We felt that we didn't have enough choices for employers to make that decision. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask a question just about cost trends. So you finished the year at 5.9, you're guiding Commercial Local Group pretty stable into 2019 despite what we've heard is a more aggressive approach to provide a rate negotiation, progress on hospital claims and medical management as you talked about Gail and then presumably some pharmacy trend savings from the PBM initiatives.","So is there a reason why we shouldn't be optimistic that trend could actually play out better in 2019? Is that a source of potential upside? Do you think you've been conservative with that guidance or have I missed anything as I'm thinking about it?","John Gallina","No. Thank you, Gary. Great question. I'll just try to clarify for everyone that we have not yet reflected the benefit of the lower drug pricing costs from our new PBM contract into that trend. So that is a variation from maybe what your commentary would be. Hopefully, we'll see a significant drop in our trend number as we get into 2019 and then again in 2020 as we fully rollout the IngenioRx platform in the better drug pricing. Associated with the other comments that you've made, we always want to be respectful in terms of the trend.","We're really trying to be on the conservative, but prudent side of the assessments, ensuring that our pricing is done very thoughtfully. And obviously, we always aspire to do better. We will always aspire to create very -- various cost of care initiatives or other items that can help mitigate trend and help bend the curve. But we feel very good about reaffirming the 6% plus or minus 50 basis points at this time.","Gail Boudreaux","Yeah. The only thing I'd add to John's comment is that as you think about it, clearly, we are very much working in integration of care and value-based payment. But I will remind everyone as we think about trend, two-third is unit cost, the third is utilization. And so, moving more of these relationships into value-based care and it really getting sort of accountable care up and running in our markets and integrating our individual primary care practice is a big part of this.","So, again, respectful of underlying dynamics of trends and we will not -- because the timing of the PBM migration is towards the back half of the year, again not incorporated yet and that will be coming over the course of the year. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Tanal","Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to confirm what I thought I heard just around sort of the approach to the 2019 selling season just in Commercial. So if I heard this right, the new businesses maybe not fully priced at the Ingenio cost structure, but probably the renewals were and that maybe help retention.","And then sort of relatedly thinking about the at least 20% of the $4 billion in terms of what drops to the bottom line. How much room is there around that 20% without sort of jeopardizing the value prop of the growth plan that you guys outlined? And then last one on this, John I think you mentioned a slightly different sort of composition to the $4 billion number today. I was hoping maybe for a little bit more color on that. Thank you.","John Gallina","Yes. Sure, Steve. Thank you. Why don't I start out with a clarification on the comment then maybe turn it over to Pete to talk more about the other part of your questions. So, in terms of January 1 renewals \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, January 1 business. It doesn't matter if those renewals if those new business, that was done under the existing contract with Express Scripts and the pricing on the existing contract with Express Scripts.","What I was talking about was in terms of how new business or renewals would reflect the better pricing, it was after our transition began. Our transition isn\u2019t going to start until later in the second quarter. And so any business that then renews or is new business at that time will then reflect the better pricing that we're getting from the CVS contract. So hopefully that clarifies the distinction of the time frame.","And then in terms of the $4 billion, certainly, there's any number of moving parts that can occur over a couple year period of time from a such a high level estimate. But in terms of the tweaks, it was relieved that the pharmacy trend has been a bit lower the last couple years then it was assumed back when the statement was first made.","So we've obviously taken that into consideration. We continue to refine our formulary, our decisions on formulary based on total member health and total cost of care, and things that we believe are in the best interest of the member and the patient. And so that has been reflected in our estimates. Our membership mix is different today than it was back in 2016 when we first made the announcement as well.","And so we've updated that. But the $4 billion, it's obviously, it\u2019s improved pricing. It's more competitive savings offer higher baseline cost. And as I said we've already taken the expected manufacturing inflation into consideration. So thank you Steve for the question. And Pete, do you have a follow-up comment?","Pete Haytaian","No. I thought your answer with respect to renewals and new business was right on point, I have nothing to add to that.","John Gallina","Thank you.","Gail Boudreaux","Great. Next question.","Operator: Your final question today comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple quick ones here. Just to clarify, John, the question earlier from Justin. The $15.89 I think you said 12 plus, plus $0.40 for half, and then the difference of that to the $19 would kind of roughly be the Ingenio contribution? Is that sort of the right framework?","And then the second piece is just does this change your contract terms with CVS? Because I thought that contract actually kicked in January 1, 2020, so it seemed obvious that that would just get pulled forward. And just help us in terms of is that sort of a lower drug pricing that kicks in and there's not a lot more than it needs to be sort of done? Obviously, you have to transition the client, but just in terms of obviously they're working through their own integration with Aetna. So if you could help there that would be great? Thanks.","John Gallina","Yeah. So, well, first of all on the guidance number, yeah the way that you've characterize it is appropriate, I did not use any percentages, you used percentages, I talked about the buyers near the higher end of the range. But other than that, yes, I agree with the way that you've characterized it. And of course, we all inspire to do more.","In terms of the CVS transition, I just want to remind people that we do have a dedicated team from CVS, who is 100% focused on a smooth Anthem migration. Anthem has a dedicated team CVS has a dedicated team. So whatever is going on with their acquisition and other things really are not relevant to our transition. So we actually feel very good.","We've been working so closely with them and going through all the timelines and all the issues and all the testing. And it's been going extremely well, which is why we're so confident with this accelerated transition that can be pulled-off with the minimal member disruption. Because at the end of the day, as Gail said, our primary focus is to move our members with minimal disruption and make sure everybody get the drugs, that they need when they need them, and then move forward and quite honestly we will have essentially a full year benefit of this contract in 2020, which is a whole year earlier.","Of all the things we're talking about him, I think that's one of the most exciting elements of this is that the full year benefit of the CVS contract and IngenioRx rollout started January 1, 2020.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you very much for joining us for this call this morning in \u2013 on Anthem's fourth quarter earnings conference call. As you can see, we are well-positioned for 2019 and beyond. And I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.","I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to Anthem and for everyone we serve. Thank you for your interest in Anthem. And I look forward to speaking with you at future events.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 AM Eastern time today through February 13.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management.","Chris Rigg","Good morning. And welcome to Anthem's third quarter 2019 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division.","Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our third quarter financial results, followed by comments on our key business initiatives and enterprise-wide growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail, and go over our updated 2019 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our Web site, antheminc.com.","We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and our quarterly filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Gail.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you, Chris and good morning. Today we reported third quarter 2019 GAAP earnings per share of $4.55 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.87, reflecting strong revenue and earnings growth across our businesses.","Operating margin was 5.8% for the quarter, a substantial improvement, both sequentially and year-over-year. Over the last several quarters, our enterprise-wide financial results have been strong and in 2019, we will exceed our long-term revenue and earnings growth targets. Anthem's third quarter operating revenue increased a robust 15% over the prior year quarter to $26.4 billion. Medical membership across all of our businesses increasing by 1.1 million consumers served with our risk businesses accounting for nearly 90% of total growth.","Anthem Specialty businesses also delivered solid growth, adding nearly 150,000 new consumers in the quarter and nearly 800,000 to the first months of this year, first nine months. Anthem Full Health Connection has been a key enabler of our strategy to increase specialty product sale, by integrating information across our packaged medical and specialty offering, driving more effective innovations to close gaps in care and reduce costs.","As part of Anthem Whole Health connection, we identified that dentist account for nearly 10% of opioid prescriptions. By leveraging this insight and mobilizing our local provider network and clinical teams, we initiated a multiyear effort to broadly educate Anthem dentist on effective non-narcotic alternative. As a result, opioids prescribed by our dental providers decreased by more than 50% and the number of opioid prescriptions exceeding 7 day supply were cut by more than 90%.","Our clinical focus is designed to support care providers by giving them data, tools and capabilities to effectively manage performance. This example illustrates the power of our focus on whole person health to deliver improved outcomes and reduced costs, while impacting one of the most pressing healthcare issues facing society today.","The migration of our pharmacy business to IngenioRx continues to go extremely well, and we remain on track to have all of our members on the IngenioRx platform by January 1, 2020. We're confident in our ability to execute on the remaining aspects of the transition, and now expect to be in a position to provide value added services at much more competitive pricing. IngenioRx is a key example of the strategic end-to-end execution that we're driving across all aspects of our business.","With each successful wave of our migration, we've implemented a command center model bringing together hundreds of associates, representing critical operational areas to work side-by-side 24\/7. Through this model, we've been able to monitor performance in real time and deploy cross functional [SWAT] teams to quickly and effectively resolve any issues or concerns.","Medicaid results improved this quarter, but at a slower rate than previously anticipated, as we had better alignment of revenue relative to the risk profile of the populations served. We added nearly 200,000 members and see continued strong growth through 2020. We remain confident we'll continue to improve our performance, while delivering even greater value for our state partners and the individuals that we serve in our Medicaid programs.","Our previously announced acquisition of Beacon Health remains on track to close late in the fourth quarter. This strategic addition to the Anthem portfolio will strengthen our market position in behavioral health and help further our efforts around whole person care. Improving performance execution around Anthem remains a key priority and focus. We've made progress in many areas but there is still more work needed in order to unlock the full potential of our enterprise.","We're very disappointed with the recently announced star rating scores for payment year 2021, which did not improve at the rate we had targeted. Unfortunately, these ratings were largely impacted by our Clinical Pharmacy results. However, with the successful transition to IngenioRx, we have refocused our organization with clear accountability and line of sight to deliver dramatically improved results going forward. We are absolutely committed to improving the percentage of our members in four star plans.","Across the Anthem, we remain intensely focused on creating innovative, meaningful and affordable products and services for our customers, consumers and care provider partners. We continue to invest in digital capabilities and AI in order to create the kind of healthcare experience our consumers demand today.","Our recently launched electronic personal health record is gaining traction. This unique tool is empowering consumers to be more engaged in healthcare decisions by supporting greater alignment and communication with their own care providers. We're excited about the launch of Sydney, our next generation consumer engagement platform.","Sydney is delivering on our promise of a simpler, more personalized experience, giving consumers control over where and how they engage with us regarding their care, benefit coverage, their health and wellness goals and more. By leveraging data and AI, Sydney is providing a personalized healthcare experience tailored to each individual's unique needs, resulting and improved engagement and ultimately a lower total cost.","Turning to 2020. In Commercial, we anticipate another solid year of both risk and fee based membership growth. In addition to the benefit of IngenioRx, we've deployed a broad portfolio of innovative products to meet our customers where they are. These include Anthem's recently announced chamber based association product along with the newly launched HealthSync high performing provider network, giving employers more affordable choices.","We anticipate another strong year of national account growth. National account customers represent our most sophisticated buyers and our success is determined by our ability to deliver better quality at the lowest net cost with improved member satisfaction. Clinical programs, such as Total Health Total You, our integrated end-to-end digital-first clinical model, are exceeding expectations on this front. Since launching in January of this year, we've added one million members and expect to have approximately 2 million consumers in 2020.","In Medicare Advantage, we're pleased to have grown enrollments by nearly 20% in 2019, and remain confident that we will continue to outpace the market for the fourth consecutive year, based on the value we deliver to seniors through our highly attractive plan design and supplemental benefits. We also anticipate continued growth in our group retiree business.","For 2020, we're enhancing our supplemental benefit choices, which are highly valued by seniors and include areas such as transportation, caregiver support and nutritional education, to name just a few. These services are an addition to our already successful over the counter benefit in partnership with Walmart. Our efforts in this area are proving that Anthem's unique focus on whole person care is truly resonating with this important population.","As you know, our Medicaid business is well positioned for robust membership and revenue growth in the year ahead. Our partnership in North Carolina is expected to go live in the first quarter, and will add approximately 400,000 members. Supplementing our strong organic growth, we look forward to working with our state partners to serve members in Missouri and Nebraska upon completion of the Centene WellCare transaction.","Our commitment to sustainability also remains a key focus for our organization. With that, I'm pleased to share that Anthem was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row during this quarter. This recognition acknowledges our commitment to responsibly address the challenges facing today's dynamic and ever evolving healthcare environment.","At Anthem, our focus on culture and talent continues to serve as our foundation for success. We are enhancing talent across the organization to support our focus on growth and improve our performance execution. We're not satisfied and know we can and will do more to improve Anthem's impact across the healthcare system for those we serve.","I will now pass the call over to John for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial performance before concluding our prepared remarks with our initial assessment of 2020. John?","John Gallina","Thank you, Gail and good morning. As Gail stated, we reported solid third quarter financial results with adjusted earnings per share increasing 28% year-over-year to $4.87. Adjusted net income was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 25% over the prior year. In total, our consolidated operating gain grew by more than 22% over the prior year quarter.","During the second quarter we shared with our outlook for improved segment performance in the second half of the year. The government business grew operating gain by 35% in the quarter, while the commercial business grew by more 11% compared to the third quarter of 2018. As you can see, not only that we deliver on our commitments, we generated substantial double-digit growth in doing so.","Operating revenue in the third quarter of 2019 was $26.4 billion, an increase of 15% versus the prior year quarter and 17% on a HIF-adjusted basis. With our updated outlook, we now expect full year operating revenue of approximately $103 billion with premium revenue now in the range of $94 billion to $95 billion. We are firmly on track to deliver our strongest year of organic operating revenue growth in over a decade.","The increase in operating revenue during the quarter reflects strong enrollment growth in our risk-based businesses, as well as premium increases to cover overall cost trends. In addition, our results benefitted from revenue related to the launch of IngenioRx and the growth in our specialty and integrated clinical offerings.","The medical loss ratio in the third quarter was 87.2%, representing an increase of 240 basis points over the prior year quarter. The increase was predominantly driven by the one year waver of the health insurer fee. In the quarter, reserves developed somewhat unfavorably, including favorable prior year development and unfavorable current your development. The unfavorable development totaled $50 million and was isolated to the commercial segment. This included a few large groups that we'll be terminating later this year. The magnitude of the impact is immaterial, representing only 0.5% of our full year benefit expense, but it did impact the medical loss ratio in the quarter.","Overall, third quarter medical costs were well contained, and our local group medical costs trend is reaffirmed at our 6% plus or minus 50 basis points range. It is important to note that the Medicaid MLR improved on a sequential in year-over-year HIF-adjusted basis despite ongoing disenrollment. We continue to expect further margin stabilization. But given the magnitude of the Medicaid re-verification challenge we faced in 2019, our full year MLR is trending in the range of 86.5% to 86.8%.","Our SG&A ratio was 12.9%, a decrease of 250 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The decrease reflects our historically strong top line growth, coupled with a one year waiver of the health insurer fee. For the full year, we now expect our SG&A ratio to be in the range of 13% to 13.3%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 40% at the end of the third quarter, which is consistent with our target range. During the third quarter, we successfully completed a debt offering to $2.5 billion at a weighted average coupon of 2.98% and a weighted average life of 15 years. I am especially pleased that our 10 and 30 year notes were issued at all time record lows.","Efficient capital deployment and cost discipline remain top priority. Earlier this year at our Investor Day conference, we committed to an opportunistic capital deployment strategy focused on sustainable long term total shareholder return. So far this year, we have announced plans for two strategic acquisitions. One of which expands our footprint in Medicaid, while the other deepens our clinical expertise and managing specialized populations. Simply put, we're building our business and investing strategically.","We also committed to a capital deployment plan that would be both flexible and balanced. After careful consideration of the market environment, we made the decision to accelerate our pace of share repurchases in the quarter, and take advantage of the broader market conditions. As a result, we repurchased 2.4 million shares during the third quarter at a weighted average price of $266.52, and we now expect the 2018 share count to be in the range of 260 million to 261 million shares. Total share buyback for the year is expected to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion subject to market conditions.","Operating cash flow was $1.7 billion in the quarter or 1.4 times net income, signifying high earnings quality for the quarter and representing an increase of $1.1 billion compared to the third quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily driven by membership growth in our Medicaid and Medicare businesses. For the first nine months of the year, operating cash flow was $4.7 billion or a solid 1.2 times net income. As a result of our strong growth year-to-date and proactive efforts to better manage our cash and the timing of collections, we now expect operating cash flow for the full year to be greater than $5.5 billion.","2019 has been a productive year at Anthem. Despite the challenges we faced early on, we have made substantial progress, including the launch of IngenioRx, which is now expected to contribute at least $1 to full year adjusted earnings per share. As a result, we're raising our full year guidance and now expect our 2019 adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $19.40. We are fully committed to driving the lowest net cost of care for our members, while achieving greater diversification across our businesses. Both of which are reflected in our double digit top and bottom line growth targets. There is still one quarter left in 2019 and our focus is on driving sustainable long-term value and completing 2019 on our growth trajectory, enabling us to enter 2020 with positive momentum.","And with that, I will now pass the call back over to Gail.","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks, John. As you've heard throughout this morning, we are growing on all fronts. Our revenue growth is strong and we have made substantial progress in advancing our mission of driving higher quality care at the lowest net cost.","As we begin to shift our focus to 2020, the headwinds that we faced are manageable with tailwinds that lay the foundation for compelling long-term growth, and far outweigh the impact from short term challenges. Our growth heading into 2020 is fueled by our commitment to precision and execution with an emphasis on sustainable value for our stakeholders.","As is customary, we will provide more detailed outlook for 2020 on our fourth quarter earnings call, but our initial view of 2020 contemplates the following tailwinds; the full year impact from IngenioRx, margin improvement in Medicaid, overall 2019 and 2020 membership growth, increased penetration of specialty and clinical programs in our fee based businesses and accretion from capital deployment. These will be partially offset by margin normalization in the individual business, dilution from government contracts in Medicaid and growth in our group Medicare and the return of the health insurance fee.","At this early stage, our view on 2020 would point to core adjusted earnings per share growth near the low end of our 12% to 15% target growth rate relative to our original 2019 guidance. We continue to expect IngenioRx will produce total operating gain of at least $800 million, or roughly $2.30 per share in 2020. We're on track for another year of historically strong revenue and earnings growth, and we look forward to building on our momentum in the year ahead. As I approach my second anniversary here at Anthem, I mean incredibly proud of them more than 60,000 associates who are living our mission, vision and values every day in service to those who trust us with their care.","And with that, operator, we will open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Just hoping you could start with providing a little more details on the unfavorable reserve development within commercial. And I know you quantified the impact in the quarter. How much of that sort of fee reflects the higher MLR outlook for the year as well and any details around that? Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks, Ralph. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian to talk about our commercial business, which we feel very strongly about and then maybe John to tie up the overall MLR question.","Pete Haytaian","As it relates to our Commercial fully insured business, earlier this year, we set out to do a couple things. Number one, to grow our membership and we want to improve our year-over-year operating performance. And I'd say with confidence that we've done both. Our year-over-year operating margins and performance has shown strong improvement. And you can see that through the release. In addition to that, we've seen solid membership growth. In fact, in our large group fully insured business, we've seen in nine of the last 12 months net sequential growth, so we feel really good about that.","The in-year unfavorable development is really immaterial. We had a few large groups and being a blue. We have some large fully insured groups but we didn't have a meeting of the minds with, quite frankly. And so those groups are going to be moving on. And as it relates to our outlook Q4 and into 2020, we feel very comfortable with our fully insured business.","John Gallina","And Ralph, this is John, thank you for the question. And I really appreciate the opportunity to provide a little bit of clarity. To be clear, Medicaid and more specifically the Medicaid verification process, is driving the entire increase in the increasing MLR guidance. And I'll just give you a couple proof points if you'd like them for your modeling and your information. In some states, re-verification efforts have minimal impact. But in others, we've seen disenrollment on the average of 2% with states going as high as 4% disenrollment. In those same states, if you review the statutory filings from the first six months of the year for us and our peers, you'll see that the MLRs associated with those remaining populations are up on average 3% year-over-year with some states being up as high as 5% year-over-year.","And as we have told you in the prior quarter call, the re-verification has impacted a little over half of our states at this point in time. And if you just take that 3% times half our Medicaid block and apply it to our consolidated medical loss ratio, you'll see that the consolidated medical loss ratio will go up 50 basis points.","And then just another quick proof point for your modeling purposes is we've made commentary that we're at the low end of our target margin ranges associated with Medicaid for the year associated with the lack of revenue on the re-verification, the time with the lack of revenue on re-verification. And the difference between the midpoint of our operating margin and the low end of our operating margin, if you apply those dollars again to the medical loss ratio, you'll see that it would drive the consolidated medical loss ratio by about 50 basis points.","So both of these things are just proof points to show that the entire increase is associated with Medicaid and that the commercial issue, which was only 0.5% of annual benefit expense really didn't drive that guidance change. So thank you for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Just one numbers question here, and then I'll ask my actual. Obviously, a lot of focus on 2020. Just want to make sure I got the math right here. We start with around $18.20 of core EPS, that's the guide of $19 minus Ingenio coming into the year. And then add 12% to that and grow that by 12% gets us in the low 20s. And then we add back the entire Ingenio of $22.30, and you get somewhere between $22.50 and $22.60. So I know the range is going to be wider than that. But is that about the right math?","Gail Boudreaux","In terms of -- we're not giving exact guidance. As you know, we're giving headwinds and tailwinds. But as you think about your math, I'd say you're in the ballpark clearly to what we articulated at our Investor Day this past spring, so yes.","Justin Lake","And then my question was just a follow up on Medicaid. Specifically, I know you said things got better. So in the first half, you were running at the low end of your range, so let's say 2%. Can you give us an idea of what you are expecting to do in the back half of the year in Medicaid, back half of this year? And then how we should think about Medicaid into next year. What's in that 2020 number for a Medicaid margin just so we can kind of have a have a starting point. Thanks.","John Gallina","The low end of the target margin range for Medicaid is where we actually expect us to be relatively close to for the entire year. But the second half is definitely going to be better than the first half in terms of 2019. And then in terms of 2020, we do expect ultimately to be in the target margin range associated with Medicaid. Unfortunately, the timing doesn't always work out perfectly and sometimes it can take 12 to 18 months to get the appropriate rates associated with our negotiations and sharing of information with our state partners.","And so we clearly have expectation of improvement associated with Medicaid in 2020. But it's really premature to provide an exact percentage, or where we are exactly in the range at this point until we get to the point that we'll provide a lot more guidance metrics on the fourth quarter call.","Gail Boudreaux","And let me just add to John's comments. I think, overall, in terms of Medicaid, we feel quite good about the conversations we're having. As he shared with you in terms of the re-verification and the data that we have, we're working very proactively with our states. And again, a lot of this comes down to timing and their cycles. But we feel quite good about what we've been able to achieve to date and also what we feel for 2020. So we're very positive about the overall Medicaid environment business going forward. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Just maybe to continue to trying to think about the 2020, what's in what's not. It sounds like you guys were assuming again the public exchange business normalizes margin. I know you had an assumption of a declining margin for three years in a row and continue to outperform it. Is that just conservatives or do you know something that would suggest that that's going to moderate? And then in Ingenio, it sounds like you're assuming that you got the same upside that you had originally forecast in terms of gain. It sounds like things have gone at least as well if not a little better. Is there any chance of upside there? And then finally, the Medicaid just to follow-on on that question, are you -- when you talk about what\u2019s the margin for next year and what's assumed in that number. Is that only what you have realized so far in terms of true ups, or are there more true ups that are potentially on the table that you haven't yet realized that would be potential upside?","Gail Boudreaux","So thanks for the multitude and multi-faceted question, A. J., I think you hit most of our businesses. So let me start with John and have him address the first part of it and we'll see if we can get through it. Thank you.","John Gallina","So yes, we do expect normalization of individual margins in 2020. And just as a frame of reference, in 2016 and 2017, we performed essentially at a breakeven basis in that line of business. We never really lost money on the exchanges but it was essentially breakeven. And then we reduced our footprint quite dramatically in 2018 by some 65% and walked away from almost a million members and had extremely successful 2018, and are having a very good 2019. We expect the margins to moderate in 2019 and they have, but not quite as quickly as we had assumed.","And then you get into 2020, while the way that the MLR rebate rules work is it's based on a three year rolling average. And so the 2017, and '18, '19 rebates would have had the prior information in them with when we were much larger. And then you get to 2020 and we've got three fairly good years assuming that we hit our target margin ranges for 2020. And so that\u2019s going to actually limit the ability to have incremental upside.","Gail Boudreaux","In terms of IngenioRx, first of all, we were really pleased with the way the transition has gone and the migration of our members. As you saw, we up our guidance and that's really a result of both strong operational execution, but also greater certainty now when we first gave it. We didn't know exactly when our state approvals would occur in Medicaid and commercial and now obviously, that we have certainty on.","And again as I shared in my opening remarks really strong execution of the migration, probably one of the most complex migrations that has happened in the space, so we're really pleased about that. And we feel very good going into 2020 that all of our businesses will now be on that platform. And we can use our integrated capabilities and the digital things that we advanced over the last year. So thank you very much for the question. And next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","A couple of questions here, so just first a follow up on the unfavorable reserve development that you saw in the commercial business, I understand that that\u2019s immaterial to the bottom line and not going to have an impact in the fourth quarter. But can you talk little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the competitive marketplace and how competitors are responding to the fact that you now have just better economics and ability to provide more affordable offerings? So that is question one. And second of all, if you can give us any early read now that the Medicare for 2020 plans are out there, how do you see the landscape and opportunities compared to before and anything that surprised you?","Gail Boudreaux","We are going to try to limit to one question. I know we're getting multiple, but we'd ask that we would just wanted to one question. And let me ask, Pete, first to comment on the commercial marketplace competitive.","Pete Haytaian","Yes, I think as it relates to our fully insured business, it remains a competitive marketplace, it remains a rational marketplace. We're real excited about our positioning. We've talked before about our segment positioning and our product portfolio, and the options that we're creating in the marketplace. And we are seeing an uptick there in terms of performance. And we continue to see growth, as I mentioned before, nine out of the last 12 months, we've seen net positive growth.","One thing that we are seeing in the marketplace today and that is with the addition of Ingenio and other capabilities that we have. We are seeing in other markets have a bit of inertia little bit more than we expected. And what I mean by that is retention rates are really, really strong for us and for our competitors. Our sales close ratios are improving, and that has to do with our sales effectiveness, and we feel really good about all that. But we are seeing a little bit less movement in the marketplace, a little bit more stickiness with the membership. And so little bit slower rates of uptake. But other than that, we feel really good about our positioning in the fully insured marketplace going into 2020.","Gail Boudreaux","And I guess what I would just add to Pete's comments. I mean, we've had really solid growth. We think it's a disciplined market. It's always been competitive. We were very happy with the solid retention rates we're seeing. And we've invested quite heavily in that business, both in product offerings. So we feel well positioned for 2020 with a variety of affordable options, particularly in our small business area.","And as I shared, we're seeing great traction in our largest clients who are really our most sophisticated and are really valuing the innovation that we brought to the market. So overall, as Pete said, it's a very, very -- we feel very strongly about the commercial business right now. And maybe Felicia Norwood can address the Medicare question you had as well.","Felicia Norwood","Sure Gail, thank you. And Ricky, thank you for the question. We feel very good about our positioning in terms of our portfolio on the Medicare side as we head into AEP. As you know, we're about what day nine into this, but the feedback has been incredibly positive from our distribution channel and our brokers. In 2019, as you know, we were one of the first plans carriers to really make a strong investment and supplemental benefits.","We believe that these are some of the most differentiating characteristics in the market with respect to our seniors. And we've seen great receptivity to the benefits that we have out there. This is particularly true with respect to our over the counter benefits with Walmart, which has brought great cost advantage and affordability to seniors. So as we head out into AEP, the competitive positioning is strong. We've enhanced our supplemental benefits offering this year as well. So we are very bullish about our expectations with respect to the 2020 selling season in Medicare.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbck","Maybe just following up on that Ingenio and the Commercial market, but maybe a broader question across all of the products, with the savings that you got for 2020. How much of that benefit did you flow through immediately into 2020? Just trying to get a sense of, was 2020 your fully updated view on pharmacy costs, and the growth that you guys or will get in 2020 is kind of reflective of what that new base is or did you -- because of the transition or for whatever reason you kind of slowly build that into the pricing so that we should expect a multiyear benefit from your membership? And did you treat Medicare or Medicaid -- or Commercial any differently, as you thought about pricing and that benefit through to the customers and the pace of that timing?","John Gallina","Sure. Thanks, Kevin. This is John. And if I understand your question properly, the benefit in 2020 is we know that the value that we're obtaining from Ingenio is approximately $4 billion, actually slightly greater than $4 billion versus what we have would have paid on with our prior carrier. And that we're going to take 20% of that and drop to the bottom line, which is the $800 million that was part of Gail's prepared comments, which is $2.30 of EPS. And then the $3.2 billion is being baked into either benefit design or more affordable pricing, or other options that flow straight to the customer.","In terms of the timing of all that, we really did not let any of that assumptions go through in 2019. 2019 for the majority of the year, we're still under the ESI contract and the pricing that we have with our book really did represent the pricing of the pharmacy costs that we're employing. So don't over read into or overanalyze the 2019 versus 2020. The Ingenio is providing about $1 in '19 and it's going to provide about $2.30 in benefit in 2020, and that $2.30 is now run rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Tanal","I think unfavorable development sort of situation seems like an isolated issue. But it sounds like you wouldn't have had a favorable development on the commercial business, excluding the large group you mentioned. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but that's sort of the message that I feel like we're hearing. And so I guess typically, we'd expect some favorable development. So just looking for any color you could provide and the balance of the business. And is your view of sort of local group trend at this point that has sort of accelerated through the first nine months of the year, realizing you reiterated your outlook. But any color maybe and where you might land in the range? So that could be helpful as well.","John Gallina","In terms of the development, we did have favorable prior development. The development that we referenced was current year in-year we usually don't talk about that. But since it was -- it did impact the MLR slightly and it certainly had impacted the commercial operating gains where Commercial grew 11% quarter-over-quarter, Commercial expanded their margins by three tenth of a percent quarter-over-quarter and that was in spite of this negative development. So really what it points to is the fact that the commercial business is even stronger than it may appear initially. But we did have favorable prior year development. We certainly have a consistent conservative reserving methodology that we will expect to employ.","Gail Boudreaux","I guess, I would add to John's comments that our commercial growth is very solid, and we have very healthy margins. And I think as you look at our margins overall, we feel very good about commercial business. And again, the amount of reserve development is fairly minor but we felt that we would point it out. And I think exactly as Pete addressed that that's really the driver. So we wanted to give you some clarity on that. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matt Borsch","I was hoping you could maybe give us a sense of how things look as you're going into January 1 in terms of -- I'm not looking for guidance for the year, just start a sense on the January 1 national account changes and how you think you did it in that process, and whether the very strong retention rates that you referenced earlier. Is that playing out in that market as well?","Gail Boudreaux","I'll let Pete address that question.","Pete Haytaian","We're obviously in the late innings. We're sort of in the ninth inning of the selling season. As it relates to 2020, there's some minor puts and takes but it's almost complete. And we feel very good about our positioning and our results. We had a good year this year. And going into 2020, we think we're going to have a very strong year as well from a growth perspective and a retention perspective. Most importantly, and as Gail pointed out in her prepared remarks, we feel really good about our value proposition and how that's playing out in the marketplace.","Things like our total value story and clinical programs and advocacy programs like Total Health Total You, which we've just recently launched with differentiated AI capabilities and care management capabilities, already have over 1.2 million members in that program. We feel really good about our consumer engagement platform and the work that we've done historically through Engage and now we've launched and rolled out the new Sydney digital platform and ecosystem. And our Anthem Health Guide from an advocacy perspective really, really performing well and resonating in the marketplace with over 8 million members in that with MPS scores that continuing to improve. So our value proposition is playing out in the market. We will have a strong Q1 with respect to growth in our national business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa"," [Technical Difficulty] on the commercial development -- unfavorable development. What exactly caused the unfavorable development? Was it a provider specifically that was higher cost? Was it a product type higher cost? Was it some geography? I'd love to drill down and understand what exactly caused that. I know you said its couple of accounts, but I want to understand more.","John Gallina","That's not the type of information for competitive reasons that we're really going to go into on this call, especially given the fact that those accounts have terminated once we determine what actuarially justified rate increases would be. I'd just say that we understand what the causes were. We priced the forward trend. We feel very comfortable that this issue has been taken care of. And we feel very bullish about our aspects. But we really can't get into the level of granularity for competitive reasons that you're talking about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","I just want to go back to the really strong government operating income growth, which is up 35% year-over-year. And when we initially saw that number this morning, we presumed some of the retro price increases for the acuity mix really had come through and driven that. But it's not what you cited in the release. You said still costs primarily things like cost performance and on the call you\u2019d said still what you're getting from states in terms of rates was not quite as good, or as you had anticipated. So I just wanted to understand that were there not material benefits from some of this acuity true ups happening in the quarter, and if it's not what was really the sources of cost performance?","Gail Boudreaux","Well, thank you very much for the question. I think there's certainly a couple of things embedded in that question. The first is that 2018 was well, as you think about the comparative from 2018 to 2019 and as you go back to our call in that quarter. So you're comparing, I think, quite frankly, a below baseline 2018. So there isn't anything unusual in this quarter for 2019 in our government business. We have made a lot of progress on getting the rates that match the population. So we feel really good about that.","But as you know, this is a complex business with geographies and a population mix. And so we still feel that there's a lot of runway and we're having those conversations in our states. And we are making progress and we are seeing it flow through, but we didn't have a giant retro payment or anything of that sort to point to in this quarter, but we did see improvement in rates and we are seeing improvement in the overall management of the business.","So I guess the summary answer to the question is the comparison. We like where we're heading but we also believe we have a lot more runway and the conversations are quite productive with our states. And we do feel confident. But again, we can't absolutely predict timing. Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","So just on the topic of Medicaid membership, over and above the shifting of Medicaid enrollees into commercial plans that's been talked about previously. I guess, I'm just curious if you can comment on the public charge rule that could create some extra volatility around Medicaid enrollment. And in light of some federal courts and joining the rules, do you think beyond just the notion this could still be material for Anthem either in late '19 and into 2020? Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","I'll ask Felicia to comment.","Felicia Norwood","In terms of the public charged rule, we haven't seen a material impact on our business year-to-date. However, the rule is still pending. We will continue to monitor this with our state partners. And certainly because of the unknowns, we are cautiously optimistic that we're going to be able to work closely with our partners as individuals are going through this process.","This in some respect is akin to some of the things you see with respect to re-verification. And one of the things that we've been able to do with our state partners is to try to understand early on individuals who have been impacted or maybe impacted, and have an opportunity to work with individuals to maintain their eligibility. So thus far we haven't seen a material impact in our business. But as I said, it's still early. So we will continue to monitor this and work closely with our state partners throughout this process.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Could you talk a little bit about the partnership strategy with the other blues that are out there? And what you're seeing as far as progress in Medicaid joint ventures, Medicare Advantage, cross sales and specialty? And do the other blues have any sort of changed perspective or greater sense of urgency in any of this given the political dialog and concepts like public option, et cetera?","Gail Boudreaux","As you know, we shared that we are working quite closely with our blue partners across a variety of opportunities. And we're very pleased with partnerships that we have in Medicaid. We have eight alliances today. Five are with our fellow Blue Cross Blue Shield partners. We're also adding additional partnerships. We're adding a Medicare partnership in Louisiana. And we're adding a partnership in Maine with the Maine Health System.","So it's broader than just the blues. I know your question was more specific to the blues. As you saw, we announced that Blue Cross of Idaho will be an IngenioRx customers. So there's another great example. So more broadly, I think we have a broad array of capabilities, both through Medicaid but also through our diversified business group. Our AIMS business and our CareMore businesses work across the spectrum. North Carolina is a great example where we are doing a partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina for Medicaid. Our CareMore business will be building clinics in that environment as well and then IngenioRx will be the PBM. So to me that offers a really great glimpse of the ability to package things across the Blue.","In terms of overall I think as a system, we're intensely focused on affordability and cost and access for the one in three Americans that we serve across Blue Cross Blue Shield plans. And I think you saw hopefully many of the Medicare focus and advertising that the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand this past year. So I think what you're seeing is that we recognize the rule we have in the American healthcare system. And by working together, we can do a lot more to have an impact on the system.","So thanks very much for the question, but we're very -- quite frankly bullish and excited about the opportunities that as a Blue system, the impact that we can have across America. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","George Hill","Just to piggyback on the one that Gary asked earlier, if we think about the expected Medicaid margin improvements in 2020, how much of that is dependent upon the risk for acuity adjustments coming through? And John, I think you talked a little bit about the timing of those tending normally 12 to 18 months, so that would kind of coincide with it kind of seeing the issue in Q2 of next year and it's starting to roll through into 2020. And I'd say just, am I thinking about that right?","John Gallina","In terms of exactly how much is related to the re-verification, well it's certainly a piece of it. But just to be clear, every year, we go through with actuarially justified rates and have rate renewals like rate renewals and negotiations with our states. And so obviously, hitting our target margins requires getting from our portfolio of states that we have of getting the right rates on an overall basis. Clearly, part of that conversation is around re-verification, but that's not the entirety of the conversation. The conversation is really about actuarially justified rates based on the acuity of the population regardless what the starting point is. So in one regard, getting the right rates is the entire issue but it's not just re-verification.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","A question around the Medicare advantage starts, I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there's a focus on improvement, et cetera. And as we kind of look through the metrics, it looked like drug experience, drug safety categories like that were the ones that show the biggest decline. So I know there's a huge delay and so as Ingenio kind of ramps up in '19 and into '20. Is there an opportunity you think to improve things for next year, or is this going to be a multiyear sort of fix? And as you guys dug in, are there certain metrics that you think you can control shorter term around the MA starts? Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","As you can -- you've clearly identified some of the areas that we've focused on as well. In terms of your question, as I said, we are disappointed in the results. And we've dug in very deeply to figure out where we can have an impact. Last year, we did make an impact in moving one of our largest contracts, our four-star with that intention and focus. But we know this year part of the issue was just the timeliness of data and our ability to have an impact on some of members in those clinical pharmacy plans now that we remove, we will be moving our entire Medicare advantage business on one-one. We're already very engaged and having an impact.","So yes, we do believe we can have an impact, not only on clinical but we also believe in some of the other metrics where we did make improvements on HEDIS, for example, in many of our markets we still have opportunities there with better data and the integration of the data that I shared with you earlier. And then certainly in some of the consumer metrics, we feel that as part of our end-to-end focus on execution across our businesses that there is opportunity there. So yes, we absolutely believe we can have an impact.","On pharmacy, now owning pharmacy 100% under our own control, we really do believe that will be a multiyear opportunity for us to dramatically expand that. So you hit the core. But as we look at our results this year, the biggest disappointment was in those clinical pharmacy results, which declined. So thank you very much for the question. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. Question just is on group Medicare Advantage. And if you can just update us on margins on the class of 2019 business are progressing relative to plan. And then relative to 2020, I know that you've talked about expected continued growth in group MA essentially. But if you can maybe help sort of size that, or just sort of how that's trending relative to the long-term trajectory that you provided for us at Investor Day? Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","I'll have, Pete, share some perspective on the group Medicare market.","Pete Haytaian","Thanks, Scott. Appreciate the question. As you know, we saw some really nice growth in 2019 in the group retiree business, and we do expect growth to continue into 2020. As we said before and we're seeing this come through, our greatest opportunity continues to be with respect to our inherent pipeline of existing commercial clients that have Medicare wrapped product. And so we're seeing really strong sales there.","As it relates to new store sales and RFPs, the market continues to be really competitive. And we do win some business there as well. But we're also looking at creating new opportunities. So the question was asked before about Blue partnerships, and we see this as another wonderful opportunity for Blue partnerships and we're actually exploring those.","And then finally I'd say having a competitive pharmacy benefit will certainly help in 2020 and beyond as it relates to upcoming bids and group retirees. So overall, we feel good that we'll continue to see growth in that space.","John Gallina","And that business is dilutive when we first say it takes 12 to 18 months of dilution. And so it continues to be a headwind until we get the block of business to an appropriate level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Windley","Josh asked my earlier question, I'm going to ask a follow on to that. I'm thinking about this MA starts and improving net investments and quality. As you think about the $3.2 billion that you have to essentially reinvest in the business. How would you, if you'd be so kind as to tell us. How would you think about allocating that between the benefit design and price point references that I think John gave earlier and then how much would quality investments like stars consume of the $3.2 billion?","Gail Boudreaux","Well, we haven't broken it down in that way. And I guess as we think about this, we're investing heavily in pharmacy, just so you know. I mean, it's not just the benefit of the impact of the earnings that we get because of the lower cost of goods sold, which is really driving that 4 billion that is fundamentally a lower cost of goods sold. But as part of bringing IngenioRx up to speed and the migration, we've built a new integrated specialty clinical service center, which has areas of excellence around these areas that I think will absolutely help our clinical performance and pharmacy.","And again, we know what we need to do. And we have a very clear line of sight around what the opportunities are in pharmacy. And we feel very confident in our ability to have an impact on those. As you think more broadly about pharmacy, I think John has shared with you how we're approaching the $3.2 billion, and it's very different based on each of our lines of business and where we were competitively and how that aligns with plan designs, et cetera. So it's not a straight line formula. But clearly, pharmacy gives us a tailwind as our opportunity in Medicare Advantage and helps us offset some of this impact from stars. Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. I was hoping you could talk about the DBG selling process beyond Ingenio. Just wondering how long the selling process is to better understand how strong the line of sight is into near term sales and some conversations so far. Do you have a sense of what the near term product mix could look like over the next couple of years?","Gail Boudreaux","I think broadly as you think about any group of services businesses, the selling cycles very much vary. Our end AIMS business has been in the market for a very long period of time. Aspire has a very mature sales cycle. And CareMore also is working as part of very much, not just the integrations that we mentioned and the partnerships we have but they've been actively talking to our Blue partners about areas where they can help.","So it isn't a definite. But I'd say generally, as you think about pharmacy, it's 12 to 18 months at least lead time. As you think about large scale projects bringing up a new CareMore sites, you're usually talking nine months plus in terms of the procurement and the discussion. AIM is a shorter sale off, because we can deal with closer capabilities and we're really excited about bring Beacon into the family in the fourth quarter, because we also believe that provide some really unique capabilities.","So overall as we've shared our diversified service business is a growing business. It's something over the next three to four years you're going to see much more significant traction. But quite frankly, we are seeing progress in sales already and we feel really good about that. But I would say at least 12 to 18 months is a lead time in terms of the conversations and the procurement just given these are fairly large sale that we're talking to people about. But thank you very much for the question, and we're very much looking forward to sharing more about DBG as we go forward. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Michael Newshel","For exchanges in 2020, can you frame the magnitude of any geographic re-expansion of your planning, and whether that kind of revenue growth could be any meaningful offset to the margin normalization you talked about?","Gail Boudreaux","Pete, please?","Pete Haytaian","We're pleased with our individual performance and progress. And I think our strategy really remains the same with respect to expansion where we're disciplined and we're targeted in terms of where we play. We've talked about this before but it's been largely based upon geographies where we can partner with key providers at the right economics and in partnership on delivering really strong cost of care, partnering with providers and being aligned on risk adjustment. And in many instances, we're focused on obviously leveraging our value based care relationships.","And of course then importantly, we have to be positioned well with respect to our product and being number one and number two as it relates to the right product. And this has translated into good results for us as we talked about earlier, bit better than expected. As we continue down this path in 2020, we're continuing to target expansions. We do see pockets where competitively some of our competitors are little bit better positioned. And if that's the case, we're going to remain disciplined and we're not going to participate in those markets in which we can't do what I said before, and that is partner with providers and have the most competitive product.","So we feel like we're continuing down the path of being very methodical and thoughtful about that business, and we'll continue to grow that business in the right way.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee","Just to clarify earlier some of your comments, John, around -- and Gail around the commercial business, these few accounts I know you didn't want to get too much into it. But the reason for termination, it sounds like you're saying is because when you re-price the business for them, those rates were just didn't match up with what I guess clients had wanted. But did that factor in also what expect to say that you would have been able to generate for them through Ingenio? And just to be clear that this shouldn't have any impact on how your commercial book is pricing for next year?","Gail Boudreaux","Well, let me start and then I'll ask John to follow up. First, in terms of the last part of your question, no, we feel really strongly. I mean, we reaffirmed our trend. We feel very strongly about our book of business. And the commercial business is performing. Our margins are good. They're improving. And honestly outside of even just risk, we're adding a lot more specialty products and bringing through revenue in our clinical products. So overall, no, you shouldn't read into anything about our commercial business. In terms of your second question, maybe I'll have John answer that one, because I don't think that there is much more to add.","John Gallina","In terms of the impact on the overall commercial book, really there is not any. Our prior guidance did assume that these members would stay with us for the rest of the year. So it was a difficult decision. So there'll be a slight impact on our year end membership. However, associated with our pricing, with our growth outlooks, with our competitive position and each of our markets, there is really no change. We feel very good about our commercial business strategy and the ability for Pete and the team to execute that. And think that 2020 is going to be another growth year for us. So thank you.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you very much for all of your questions. And I'd like to thank everyone for hanging in there this morning while we dealt with the phone issues, but we're happy that we were able to address all of your questions and still get everyone through the line.","As you can see, we remain committed to delivering a simple, more affordable and personalized experience for those we serve.

Welcome to the Anthem First Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I now like to turn the conference over to the company\u2019s management.","Chris Rigg","Good morning, and welcome to Anthem\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division.","Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our first quarter financial results, followed by comments on our key business initiatives and enterprise-wide growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail and go over our updated 2019 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call.","Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Gail.","Gail Boudreaux","Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Anthem's first quarter earnings call. Today, we reported a strong start to 2019 with first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $5.91 and adjusted earnings per share of $6.03, driven by our strongest risk-based membership growth in nearly a decade. With confidence in growing momentum, we are increasing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to greater than $19.20 per share.","During the first quarter, we grew total medical membership by 905,000 consumers across all business lines, with more than 75% of that growth coming from risk-based membership. At Investor Day, we committed to growing our commercial business in-part by developing a broad suite of new consumer products and making it easier for our customers and brokers to do business with us.","We\u2019ve redesigned our business processes, streamlined our service offerings, and enhanced our online employer shopping portal and digital broker tools. During the quarter, our commercial business added nearly 400,000 members. Of note, risk-based group membership increased in the quarter reflecting a substantial improvement over the mid-single digit decline in the first quarter of 2018.","Administrative fees and other revenue increased by more than 7% over the prior year quarter. Outpacing fee-based membership growth demonstrating that our sales of our specialty products and clinical wellness solutions are gaining traction in the market. Our Medicare Advantage enrollment grew by nearly 14% in the first quarter, above the market and driven by our unique supplemental benefits.","As part of our Medicare offering, we launched a social determinants of health benefits package in which members can expand coverage for benefits such as healthy meals, transportation, adult day care, and in-home personal care. Our focus on caring for the whole person is designed to deliver better care and outcome, reduce cost, and ultimately accelerate growth.","We are on track to deliver on our full-year Medicare advantage growth target of greater than 20% and we continue to expect year-end group Medicare Advantage enrollment of nearly 200,000 members. As a result of our strong product and service offerings for dual special needs members, we\u2019ve historically seen approximately 60% of our individual Medicare Advantage growth coming from outside of the annual enrolment period.","Currently, over 20% of our individual Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in dual special needs plans. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve added nearly 600,000 members in Medicaid, including approximately 330,000 members through the successful launch of our alliance with Blue Cross, Blue Shield, and Minnesota in January. We expect our partnership model will continue to accelerate growth.","Over the near-term with Blue Cross, Blue Shield, and North Carolina and through a recently expanded agreement with Blue Cross, Blue Shield, and Louisiana for the dual eligible population. As we look ahead, chronic care and value-based solutions like CareMore and Aspire are clear differentiators as states move medically complex populations into managed care. These offerings not only position us for long-term growth in our own states, but allow us to be the partner of choice for our Blue peers.","Beyond the capabilities of CareMore and Aspire, we are also developing unique public private partnerships such as our Blue Triangle Program. The program seeks to improve the quality of life and faster independence for Indiana\u2019s Medicaid members. Launched in 2017, Blue Triangle targets homeless individuals with a variety of unmet physical and mental health needs and provides them with additional health care, housing, and social support.","Since inception, the program has reduced inpatient behavioral health cost by 55% and emergency room spending by 32%, while at the same time moving 59% of program participants into permanent housing. We are pleased with the results of our Blue Triangle program and recognize the impact our partnerships can bring to our members and our communities.","Medical cost performance in the first quarter was in-line with expectations and reflected our relentless focus on managing the overall cost of care. The relationships we have built with care providers is driven by our unmatched local market presence. We continue to strengthen those relationships through programs like enhanced personal healthcare enabling Anthem to lead the industry and value-based payment penetration. The growth of our value-based care model has been substantial.","By the end of 2019, we expect to have 58% of medical spend tied to value-based care, up from 49% in 2017. Further in 2019, we expect 30% of our value-based care will be tied to shared savings programs, up from 24% in 2018. And we are well-positioned to achieve our 2023 target of 50%. All-in, we expect enhanced personal healthcare to generate nearly $600 million of savings for our customers and consumers during 2019.","Our efforts in value-based care are supported through our artificial intelligence programs like predictive service, which allow us to determine when members or care providers might call us. And rather than waiting for them to call, we reach out to them proactively via phone, text, or email.","AI enables this program by understanding patterns and reasons that trigger cost. Based on these patterns we can link AI to events that happen on a regular basis such as claims adjustments, referrals, and prior authorization requests improving both the care provider and consumer experience, as well as the cost of care.","Turning to our pharmacy business, earlier this month, IngenioRx hosted its second annual client conference. Attendance more than doubled this year and was well attended by consultants, brokers, and current and prospective employer and Blue plan clients. In its role is a true thought leader. IngenioRx leaders discussed topics ranging from how we approach pharmacy networks to planning for the specialty pipeline.","Interest in IngenioRx is continuing to build as our value proposition becomes increasingly evident to the market. IngenioRx is built to drive the lowest absolute cost for our consumers. In 2020, we will move to providing point of sale rebates and our commercial risk-based business and we are prepared to do the same in our Medicare business.","In our fee-based business, our benefit designs provide flexibility as we believe employers should have a say as part of the broader discussion and value-based care and total health, and therefore we\u2019re prepared to support the desired approach regarding their health benefits strategy. Looking ahead, we are in the final stages of preparing for the launch of IngenioRx and we will begin migrating some of our members on May 1.","We have 2,500 individuals solely focused on this transition. We've conducted endless testing and are focused on creating a positive experience for our members. We are confident in our ability to execute this transition for our clients and members who will begin to realize the benefits of IngenioRx as they are migrated. We are ready and we are on track to meet our financial commitments.","At Investor Day, we noted that this is a new era on Anthem. Our business results share today and our strategic plans moving forward are driven by a strong and intentional focus on our culture. Our vision, mission and values are our foundation. They are clear, purposeful, and bold and they guide our more than 60,000 associates in this time of growth at Anthem. Our focus on culture is enabling our team to expect more of themselves and create real change for those we are fortunate to serve.","And now, I will turn the call over to John to discuss the first quarter financial results and our revised 2019 outlook.","John Gallina","Thank you, Gail, and good morning. Once again, we reported a strong start to the year with first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $5.91, and adjusted earnings per share of $6.03 growth of more than 11% over the prior year quarter. Our first quarter performance was driven by solid membership growth across all lines of business, medical membership grew by more than 1.2 million lives year-over-year, driven by significant growth in our risk-based businesses.","During the quarter, government membership increased by 511,000 members, followed by our commercial business, which added 394,000 members and is reflective of our focus on execution. First quarter operating revenue was up 9% over the prior year quarter to $24.4 billion, absent the impact of the health insurer fee on 2018 revenue, core-operating revenue in the first quarter of 2019 grew in excess of 11% year-over-year, driven by higher enrollment in all lines of business and premium increases to cover overall cost trends.","The medical loss ratio was 84.4% in the first quarter, an increase of 290 basis points over the prior year period. The increase was largely driven by the one-year waiver of the health insurer fee and significantly lower out of period revenue in the Medicaid business. Operating margins in both our Medicare and Medicaid businesses are within our long-term target range even with the dilution from our growth in group Medicare and entering a new Medicaid state. ","Additionally, in the first quarter of last year, we disclosed several out of period retroactive rate adjustments in our Medicaid business. The non-recurrence of these retro rate adjustments was contemplated in our guidance and is a significant factor in the quarter-over-quarter profitability comparison within our government business division. There are routinely out of period adjustments within the Medicaid portfolio as large and diverse as ours.","We expect more normalized year-over-year growth in the government segment over the latter three quarters of the year. The SG&A ratio was 13%, an improvement of 230 basis points relative to the first quarter of 2018. The improvement reflects the absence of the health insurer fee, growth in operating revenue, and expense management. We do expect the SG&A ratio to increase the rest of 2019, due to additional investment spending, including additional cost to support the launch of IngenioRx.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 40% consistent with our targeted range. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $275.23 per share, totaling $294 million.","Operating cash flow was $1.6 billion or 1.1 times net income and in line with expectations. While this is a very strong result, the metric declined since we received an extra payment from CMS in the first quarter of 2018. As expected, Days in Claims payable increased by 2.3 days sequentially to 38.5 days.","Overall, we were pleased with our first quarter performance and we are increasing our full-year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $19.20. Our updated earnings guidance reflects our solid first quarter results and slightly better than previously anticipated revenue growth.","Further, we now expect the percentage of full year 2019 earnings in the first half of the year to approach the mid 50% range, slightly higher than we expected when we reported fourth quarter results.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Congrats on these results. And I guess for us, the question is going to be just around the Medicaid cost trends you had that bought up in the press release that in certain states maybe still little bit elevated and I thought you want to talk about which states, maybe just give a little more color on what you're doing as far as some of the initiatives to improve some of that Medicaid cost trend.","John Gallina ","Yes, thanks, Steve. This is [Technical Difficulty] some of the conversations she is having with their state partners. In terms of the government business division in total, just to provide clarity even with the elevated cost structure. That business is operating well within targeted margin ranges and we're very comfortable with that. And as you do look at the government business because we don't spike out Medicaid separately in the press release or in our script. ","The government business has declined slightly year-over-year with the Group retiree growth that we had is slightly dilutive, which has obviously positioned us very well for the future. And then as you noted, we have a few select states where we\u2019re not performing at target margins. And we're working with the states on the daily basis to ensure the rates that we receive are actuarially sound and accurately reflect the acuity of the membership.","Felicia, maybe if you'd like to talk a little bit about medical management initiatives or some of the other conversations, you're having with state partners.","Felicia Norwood ","Thank you, John and thank you, Steve. As John said, our Medicaid business is a portfolio of businesses. And when you take a look at a portfolio as large and diverse as ours, you will always see performance variability across our state. As you said, we are not going to get into the details, specifically on a state by state basis, but our team works every day, our state partners to make sure that we are securing actuarially sound rates that really represent the acuity of the population in profile that we're serving. ","We have in place in our business, solid foundational ways of managing members, particularly members that are complex and have high cost trends. The addition of our Aspire and CareMore capabilities give us very strong capabilities around managing members who are medically complex. So, we feel very good about our medical management capabilities and we certainly feel very good about our ability to work collaboratively with our state partners around securing actuarially soundly.","Gail Boudreaux ","Well, thank you. Thanks for the question, Steve, I'll just sort of wrap up. I think our perspective. We see the government business both Medicare and Medicaid as a very strong growth platform for us and feel good about the overall portfolio. And certainly, the Medicare Group business is an area that we've targeted for significant growth. And as John said, we\u2019re fully expected to see that to be somewhat dilutive in the beginning of a contract. Next question please. Thank you.","Operator","Now to the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hi, can you hear me.","Gail Boudreaux ","Yes.","Gary Taylor","Hi, thanks. I just wanted to check on when we look at the government margin performance, it looks like if we exclude the retroactive adjustments from a year ago that would explain after three quarters of the deterioration align in the government business and I wanted to make sure I was roughly in the ballpark on that. And then related to that when we look at the prior year development in the first quarter of 2018, which was pretty evenly split between commercial and government, I presume when the K comes out without those retroactive adjustments the government PYD would be one of the places where the overall prior year development is lower, just wanted to make sure we're directionally on track with that thinking?","John Gallina","Hi, Gary, thanks for the questions. In terms of the year-over-year profitability, I hate to use the same answers over and over again and clearly the out-of-period is an issue as you pointed out. The dilution associated with the Group retiree is an issue. We did just launch a new state in terms of Minnesota. Our partnership with Minnesota Blue Cross and Blue Shield Medicaid that's obviously impacting some of our metrics on a year-over-year basis.","So, there's a whole list of things, but yes, directionally, I think you're in the right ballpark. And associated with the prior year development, I guess the only comment that I would make is, without disclosing the specificity of line of business is that 12\/31\/2017 we had the individual business 1.6 million individual members and had the reserves associated with that. ","And so then the roll forward footnote, a year ago had the run out associated with individual in it and we only have about 30% of that number of members today and so the run out in here in the current period is obviously based on a much smaller base and that will be a reconciling item on top of the commentary that you made.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Next to the line of Ana Gupte with SVP Leerink. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","Thanks, good morning. Yes. So, congrats on the commercial fully insured growth. I was asking about the pricing, I think you said you've been going to market and total cost of care bundled, I wanted to get a sense for how much of a discount that represents relative to others that are either doing this integrated strategy or not and if the share gain coming from other fully insured players or from self-insured stop loss or new growth?","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Thank you for the question Ana. There\u2019s a couple of pieces in there. Let me try to address then and I'll ask Pete to comment on what's been sort of our strategies in the commercial business. First and foremost, thank you for recognizing we feel very good about our commercial growth this quarter and quite frankly our projections for the full-year. We had made a commitment to grow our risk-based business and we did deliver [Technical Difficulty] at the full year numbers. I think more than anything, it's a combination, pricing, it's a competitive market. We have stayed very disciplined in our pricing. So, it's less driven just by pricing than a full portfolio of products.","We've also invested in tools, as I mentioned in my opening comments around our brokers and trying to simplify our business processes, and also make sure that all of our 14 commercial states are really operating under a single, what I call, operating sales infrastructure, sales discipline, and sales execution. So overall, yes, we are doing a couple of things around product.","We are moving heavily to value-based reimbursements. I think that's also been a positive in terms of the alignment of our clinical programs with our value-based reimbursement network structure and then our products, those have combined. And then maybe I'll ask Pete to comment a little broadly because it's not just our risk base, you saw our revenue grew in the quarter, which is also a very specific strategy about bundling. So, Pete, do you want to add some?","Pete Haytaian","Yes, thank Gail and thanks Ana. And yes, I'd say that it's a competitive marketplace, it's not necessarily we only, but it continues to be competitive rational marketplace. We've talked over the last several quarters about our \u2013 about our segment structure about our centers of excellence. We do see all those things playing through and as Gail noted, we're bringing much better products to market and options we're meeting our customers where they are.","We're providing greater services to our distributors and engaging with providers in a differentiated way creating choice in the marketplace. So, overall, we're very pleased with respect to our growth. As Gail said, we focused on a couple of major things going our fully insured business. We saw that play through and our group fully insured business, we've had seven consecutive quarters of sequential growth. And number 2, we talked about and Gail referenced this, our margin expansion in our ASO business and that continues to improve, month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter. ","There are many things that are contained therein. Obviously, we look forward to the onset of IngenioRx and the value that that would create in our ASO margin profile. But importantly as it relates to the other things that we talked about selling specialty products, you see as a very strong proof point, our specialty product growth, growing over 550,000 members sequentially in the quarter as a strong proof point. We're selling more stop loss into our accounts. We continue to bundle our clinical packages effectively and we are on a path to this from 5 to 1 to 3 to 1 [a week].","So, overall, we feel very good about that, I feel very good about the team and the execution. We think the momentum will continue as you know, we'll probably see things lighten up in the second quarter, but the momentum of growth will continue in [the third]. Thanks Ana.","Gail Boudreaux","Great, thank you very much for the question. Next question please.","Operator","Next to the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks, good morning. Wanted to go to Iowa specifically and if you could maybe just give us a sense of what's embedded in guidance and maybe how the lives are also sort of dived up as initially. I'm assuming you expected maybe to see some share to [2017] initially and now that you noted down, is that still the case or will you essentially keep your existing book and just take on the incremental U&H lives. I'm just trying to get a sense of the churn to that membership base and what's assumed in your guidance? Thank you.","John Gallina","Sure. Thanks, Ralph. And in terms of the guidance, I'll provide a little clarity on what's included and then ask Felicia to talk a little bit about the conversations with the state and the fact that a lot of this is still not yet completely finalized. But our guidance is that we have a little bit more than [30 about a percent], about a third of the members within the state right now and our guidance assumes at least for purposes of what we've just provided that we would retain that level of membership. Our guidance also assumes that we will get actuarially justified rates beginning July 1, 2019. And so, I will turn it over to Felicia to talk little bit about the dynamics of what's going on based on that.","Felicia Norwood","Yes, good morning and thank you, Ralph. If you can imagine, we're working very closely with our state partner in Iowa right now and those conversations include a range of discussions, including what happens with respect to membership allocation, as well as what happens with respect to rates. Certainly, out of respect for the conversations that are going on right now, it wouldn't be appropriate to comment on the specifics of those conversations. And as John indicated to the extent things change, we will certainly update any guidance. I will say that our goal and our focus is making sure that we have actuarially sound rates that will allow a sustainable program in Iowa and allow us to continue to serve the Medicaid beneficiaries there and improving [Technical Difficulty].","Ralph Giacobbe","Thank you.","Gail Boudreaux","Alright, thank you very much. Next question.","Operator","Next the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. Can you give us some context for the $14 billion DBG and IngenioRx build out by sizing the addressable market for Anthem? And can you update us on your progress on discussions you're having for selling technology or PBM externally and if there is a difference in the response, you're getting from Blue versus non-Blue? Thanks.","John Gallina","Sure. Thank you for the questions and the numbers that you give you just itemized are 2023 targets. So clearly, it will take several years to get to that point. We had disclosed that we expect the combination of both diversified business [Technical Difficulty] to achieve about 8% to 10% of the total revenue of the company on a consolidated basis, which is where the $14 billion came from in 2023 and then \u2013 in about 10% to 11% margins diversified business group being a bit higher than that and IngenioRx being in the single-digit margin range.","Quite honestly, we're working very closely with many, many folks. But we don\u2019t expect to see a significant ramp in a lot of these sales process, specifically in IngenioRx until 2021. We are wholly focused on getting the transition completed here in 2019 and delivering the full run-rate value that we promised in 2020 and then have a lot of proof points then associated with the sales activity. And then on the diversified business group, we continue to be opportunistic in terms of building out the portfolio.","We've had several very positive conversations with other Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in terms of being able to provide the services. We actually have several Blues who are our customers today. We want to continue and expand those relationships. So, we feel very good about the 2023 expectations that have been provided, but it will take a few years to ramp up to that point.","Gail Boudreaux","And, Sarah, just a few additional comments I think to John's very thorough response. I think as John said, our primary focus in 2019 going into 2020 is the successful migration of our existing book of business. But we are seeing some early traction. As I mentioned in my comments, we did have our second client conference and had very strong attendance. Our integrated guarantees where we're focused on 4% health are resonating, plus we are looking to pull through pharmacy, certainly in the partnerships that we're doing with other Blues and that's the case certainly in our new North Carolina been and I think we have an opportunity to continue to do that across the partnerships that we're forming.","So, I think it's a fairly broad-based strategy. But again, intense focus on the migration of IngenioRx in 2019 and we're beginning obviously the selling season, you'll see more of that into 2020 and 2021, and DBG as well, but we see it as a real opportunity to package our products in a very integrated way and look at overall total cost of care.","Thank you very much. Next question please.","Operator","Next from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Hi, thanks, good morning. I guess a question more sort of just on the Blue strategy, longer term, Gail as you think about Anthem's three to five years from now, what does success look like, what would you be pleased with in terms of products and JVs and other connections to the other Blues?","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you for the question Josh. It's a great question and I mean, I think we outlined much of that at our Investor Day in terms of \u2013 each of our Blue partners is unique and each of them has unique set of circumstances, I think a success for us obviously is to consider \u2013 is to continue to be able to package our IngenioRx solutions to continue to do partnerships in Medicaid. We're really pleased with the partnership we just announced expanding our Louisiana venture into the dual eligible market, we think that's another great opportunity.","So, we're going to be very opportunistic and we have an opportunity I think through our DBG as, as CareMore is expanding with several of our Blue partners as, as Aspire, aim has been a longstanding partner to the Blues. I think as we mature in this space, we look at an opportunity to really package, a series of our off [Technical Difficulty] versus single one-offs and we are going to risk arrangements as well with them, particularly in our CareMore organization. ","So, I think that's the maturity of our business. Once we complete our own conversion of IngenioRx, I think that's another opportunity for us to offer. I think a very strong integrated platform in a very different way, because, again, we're partners not competitors with our fellow Blues plans.","Thank you very much for the question. Next one please.","Operator","Next the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee","Yes, thanks for taking the question. John, obviously we raised the guidance here for the full-year 2019, if I recall, at the Analyst Day, you guys had pointed out in our expectations for about 20% EPS growth this year and also for next year, when we think about next year, should we think about 20% on top of the revised guidance or is something going to think of this sort of \u2013 not going to pull forward, but we shouldn't build on top of this revised number and I guess related to that as we think about the SG&A improvement this year, is there anything in there we should think about one-time in nature or is just a good run rate as we think about our model going forward and maybe factoring how Ingenio cost ramp into that as well? Thanks.","John Gallina","Thank you, Charles. And in terms of the guidance we're very bullish about how we started the year and we really did raise the guidance because of our strong revenue growth. We grew membership across all lines of business, risk membership at some of the best growth we've seen in quite some within the company, and very, very bullish. Most of the metrics we didn't have to change the guidance on, but very, very strong top line growth. So, I would say, from that perspective. While we are not yet providing 2020 guidance. There is nothing that this guidance raise that does that impacts our long-term growth strategy and the percentages that we laid out at Investor Day at this point in time.","And then associated with the SG&A ratio, it is very, very good here in the first quarter. We do expect SG&A ratio to go back up in the latter half of this year as we finalize the accelerated rollout and implementation of IngenioRx and migrate all of our members from now through January 1, 2020 onto the new CVS platform. So, the SG&A ratios and guidance that we provided, we\u2019re going to maintain, because we expect our SG&A ratio to be a little higher the last part of the year than it is here in the first quarter.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","The line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Hi, everybody. I thought maybe I'd ask you about capital deployment, obviously in the last 3 or 4 months, there's sort of a shifting landscape of opportunities on the one hand with the Washington backdrop, you know stock has come in, so there is an opportunity perhaps on the buyback side and on the flip side and M&A I know traditionally looked at Medicare Advantage and care management capabilities, but there is also potential opportunities in around Medicaid and in pharmacy benefit. Would \u2013 just seeing whether you'd comment on whether you have any interest in those areas, I know you've got a lot on your plate bringing Ingenio, but would there be capability should be interested in picking up on the PBM side and perhaps?","John Gallina","Yes, so thanks A.J. and I think just based on the way you phrase the question, I think our answer, very appropriately as to say that we're going to maintain a balanced approach to capital deployment. At Investor Day, I laid out that we expect to utilize 50% of our free cash flow for either reinvesting in the business or M&A about 30% over the long term on share buyback and 20% for dividends.","However, that 50% and 30% could actually shifted at any point in time, based on current market conditions and opportunities that are out there. In terms of M&A opportunities -- absolutely we're very focused on the MA tuck-ins that either provide us a footprint or solidify our footprint in the market that we don't have by enhancing capabilities, specifically associated with our diversified business group and various other things, but we're not taking anything off the table at this point in time, but we do want to be opportunistic, we want to make sure it provides the best long-term shareholder value and we will react to market conditions accordingly.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. A.J. Next question please.","Operator","Next line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks, good morning. My question is on your earnings seasonality. First off, appreciate the update John, by my math using 55% of EPS in the first half implies 2Q would be about $4.53, which is up about 6%, 7% year-over-year. So just curious whether you can lay us out some of the puts and takes to consider in Q2 from an earnings perspective and maybe touch on the PBM specifically, if you can in terms of whether any of the PBM earnings power that you've talked about will benefit 2Q or perhaps it's actually a drag in Q2, due to start-up costs? Thanks.","John Gallina","Yes. Thank you, Justin. Great question. And as always, I am always very impressed with your modeling capabilities. But in terms of 2Q, there is a lot of things impacting the 2Q seasonality as much as your things impacting the seasonality of the other quarters. So, you specifically called out that IngenioRx, we're going to start the IngenioRx implementation on May 1, but the vast, vast majority of the membership that transition in 2019 is in the second half of the year and just [half way] that does not even include all of our Medicare business, our individual ACA business that\u2019s slated to migrate on January 1, 2020, which still gives us a full-year of 2020 benefit but zero in 2019. ","So, virtually the entirety of the benefit of IngenioRx that was described at Investor Day, the $0.70 to $0.90 increase in our guidance, is all in the third and fourth quarter. And then here in the first quarter, we had the year-over-year issues associated with the Medicaid out of period from 12 months ago. So, the second quarter is normalized, I think it could be, it's the other quarters that are impacting. The only other thing I will say is that the second quarter could be a slight drag from Ingenio given the investment that we're going to make in terms of ensuring that the transition is done very, very well. But at 55%, yes, your math is certainly very credible.","Gail Boudreaux ","Next question please.","Operator","Next the line of Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matt Borsch","Yes, I was hoping you could just talk about 2020, in terms of the Medicare Advantage product now that you have the final rates and as you consider the impact of the health insurer fee coming back in the competition, so forth understanding you can't reveal your strategy per se, but can you touch on some of the factors that you're thinking about?","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks for the question, Matt, I'll ask Felicia to provide some more commentary, as you know and I think you said in your question, we're still in the bid process now. So, we will from competitive reasons not go into too much detail, but maybe Felicia will give you a little bit of color on how we're thinking about 2020.","Felicia Norwood","Yes, thank you for the questions and when we think about 2020. Obviously, we always take a balanced approach as we think about our bid process. This past year, as you know we [Technical Difficulty] we believe that they help to drive growth for us from an overall business perspective and we appreciate the flexibility that CMS has provided in terms of expanding those benefits as we had in 2020. So, when we take a look at where we are, we've obviously been pleased with the growth that we've seen this year and look forward to continuing to accelerate our growth above the industry average as we move into 2020.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Next Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Thanks. I wanted to ask you about the JVs you are doing with the other Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and how that\u2019s impacted by the ongoing MDL litigation against the Blue Cross, Blue Shield Association. If you look at the Cigna litigation, it seems like you guys thought that the MDL litigation might actually settle with them a couple of years and that seems to have not happened. So, what's your thought process on that and is that can actually help to get more JVs done or does it hurt you if it gets resolved in some way?","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks for the question. Peter. We won't comment on ongoing litigation. But in terms of the joint ventures. I mean those are really born opportunity for us to take \u2013 just like we would quite frankly other partners in the marketplace that we're doing joint venture [Technical Difficulty] and really as we've shared before these joint ventures are all very unique and they're all very much driven by the market conditions in that state and really strong platform that we have as part of our Medicaid business, and we see that as a really strong opportunity for us to expand that platform.","So, I think it's really, it's that part of our strategy has been very clear that we wanted to work more collaboratively with our Blue partners because we do think many of them have not had the depth of expertise in government programs. And we think that's a huge opportunity for growth we've included that in our outlook. And again, each of these partnerships is very unique and very different. But I would also tell you that we have many of these, for example, the main health ACO and our joint venture in Colorado and behavioral health. So, they're a very broad footprint, broader than just, but again, we do see some significant opportunity with Blue partner again leveraging the strengths that we bring to the market and we think we'll have opportunities in pharmacy and across as well.","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Next Zachary Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Zachary Sopcak","Hi, good morning, thanks for the question. In the opening comments, Gail, you talked about point of sale rebates for the commercial risk book for 1\/1\/2020. I just wanted to clarify is that the entire risk book? And then for the fee-based book. I appreciate your comments on flexibility, going forward if point-of-sale rebates become mandated by the government through legislation, how would you expect the in players to react to that, do you think they will tighten formularies or take other action? Thank you.","Gail Boudreaux","Thanks for the question. I think first and foremost, what's really important in this discussion around pharmacy rebates and pricing etcetera is getting to the absolute lowest cost in that, as I shared at Investor Day is really what we're building in IngenioRx on. We start in a very unique position, because we're building a farm PBM, new generation PBM and as you might recall our PBM rates were not competitive. And so, our ability to offer extremely competitive rates in the numbers that we've shared with you really stem from that.","From the point of service you on the commercial [Technical Difficulty] once we get through our conversion, we build [Technical Difficulty] for our consumers across our book of business and we think that certainly makes sense for the marketplace and again in the self-funded business our view there is to match what our customers want, we're fully prepared to offer point-of-sale rebates, but again we want to be aligned to what customers want.","Your specific question about if rebates were to go away \u2013 rebates are affected tool in terms of negotiation. So, I think that's important to remember in this. But again, understanding that we want to be very transparent. On the side of rebates as you think about this, certainly in the government program, HHS has said it will create an alternative discounting arrangement, we need to understand the details of that and work with that. We believe there are other ways to create value through \u2013 for example our integrated guarantee and looking at our whole health strategy, which is gaining some traction in the market and there are also other opportunities around product expansion fees, admin fees etcetera.","So, it doesn't all rely on those and again I know a lot of focus is spent on rebates, it's less than 10% of the drugs and all drugs, most of the drugs, I would say almost all of the drugs that are rebatable have competition. So, our view on that is that, we think it's a very prudent strategy and we feel very good about being able to launch a PBM that starts in a very different place than trying to retool an existing model.","Thanks for the question. Next please.","Operator","Next Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, thanks. Just want to go into the guidance a little bit more, you mentioned I guess revenue coming in a little bit better as one of the drivers, but as you mentioned, didn't really change any of the components behind the guidance. So, just wondering where within those ranges maybe you actually feel at the higher-end more likely at that membership as a specialty flow through MLR, G&A, I guess maybe a little bit more color on where in those ranges you're looking at.","John Gallina ","Yes, thanks, Kevin. Great question. One of the areas that really wasn't part of the specific guidance and we are just very, very pleased with the results are in the administrative fee revenue for the quarter and which is the greater upselling of value-added services, as well as the specialty membership and both of those have outpaced our core medical membership quite nicely and really helped contribute to the top line and help contribute to the bottom line. ","As said, we did raise our earnings per share by $0.20 this quarter without changing the core metrics. So, we\u2019re still within the balance of our guidance range and are comfortable with our revised guidance. Our growth has been in all lines of business, but we did not provide specific guidance on administrative fee revenue and specialty membership and those did exceptionally well. So, thank you.","Gail Boudreaux","Next question please.","Operator","Now to Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Windley","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back follow-up on Justin's question as he pointed out, your 2Q implied guidance here would be kind of mid-single-digit year-over-year growth compared to \u2013 if I look at XPBM growth is in the mid-teens. So, it does appear that there's some seasonal cadence differences year-over-year in something MLR, SG&A and I guess I wanted to understand a little bit better what that might be. I presume that it's not just the spending on IngenioRx because my assumption there is that you're spending a lot of money in the first quarter as well. But maybe, correct me where I'm wrong.","John Gallina","You know, Dave, we obviously are spending a lot of money in the first quarter, as well as second quarter with very minimal benefit from IngenioRx in the second quarter, offsetting a bit of it with IngenioRx benefits really being back loaded to the second half of the year, but we have a lot of things going on like, for instance, the dilution of our Group retiree business. I mean that obviously extends throughout the entirety of the majority of 2019.","It's going to take us a good year to get the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, so that in 2020 we\u2019re going to be more profitable and then even later in 2022, we have target margins on that. All those things are going into the consideration in terms of the year-over-year comparability. So, it's actually, it's a lot of positive things that are having a short-term negative impact associated with the quarter-over-quarter reviews.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Next the line of Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Tanal","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the benefits ratio, and just get some more color there if we can. So, I guess up to 90 basis points year-on-year, if I think was guided to about 200 bips for the year and then the retroactive revenue adjustments in Medicaid, it's $0.20 last year. I think that's about 35 bips. So, there's sort of a balance of uptick about 55 basis points and clearly if PYD was down year-on-year, but I think you noted in the release that development was better than you expected. So any comments on kind of the quarter itself, as well as maybe just following up on sort of the seasonality discussion kind of pursuant to this point, is it sort of fair to say that maybe some of the value of the forthcoming PBM savings are sort of shared with some of the customers upfront or any sort of thought process on that. Just thinking about the seasonality of MLR Q1 versus the full year obviously a much tighter range should now this year than in years past? That's it, thanks.","John Gallina","Sure. Thanks, Steve. And I'll just say, just to take it off the table, the IngenioRx and whatever structure savings benefits that does not impact the first quarter of 2019 in the MLR at all, but I will say, first, I'd like to reaffirm our medical loss ratio guidance of 86.2% plus or minus 30 basis points. As I said, we've held that constant, as you mentioned, is obviously a big driver, basically 2% of the change. And yeah, but we also have the Group Retiree business, which is again it's dilutive, which means that it's increasing the MLR on a temporary basis.","The mix of business we have now versus a year ago is a little bit more skewed to the higher MLR business, especially with the significant growth we've had in our Medicaid lines of business over the past 12 months. And the out-of-period adjustments you mentioned them, yes, it's clearly a driver. So, our cost trends are consistent at 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. We feel very comfortable with our guidance and in the quality of our earnings.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Next Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Hi, thanks. I just want to ask a modeling question just to make sure that I've got this right, because it's a new line for all of us, just in terms of cost of products sold and you're guiding for the $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. I guess, John, can you sort of maybe walk us through just the cadence of how we should be thinking about that with the IngenioRx rollout in terms of 2Q and then sort of relative to 3Q, 4Q on that?","John Gallina","Sure. The cost of products as you mentioned there's is going to be a new line item. And that is going to relate from an accounting perspective, when we provide PBM services to our ASO clients or independent third-party clients, we would recognize cost of products expense associated with the fulfillment of their pharmacy benefit. And then the revenue, that would be associated with that would obviously be the reimbursement, we would get associated with those cost in our products, those all the value-added services that Ingenio is making and providing and the profit margin associated with that. ","As said, that will be relatively small again in the second quarter and then ramp up in the third quarter and obviously be a little bit more in the fourth quarter associated with the $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion of cost. Ingenio, the revenue, I would say or the benefit should reconcile back to that $0.70 to $0.90 improvement in guidance that we provided associated with Ingenio, which would be the revenue aspect of the cost of product, which is the expense number.","Gail Boudreaux","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Now to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Frank Morgan","Good morning, Gail. In your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned, when you were discussing social determinants of health. I think you mentioned a personal care services benefit that you'd added to some of your plans, I'm just curious about the extent that benefit is all for today? How many states it's in, any plans to expand that and have you really identified that yet as an opportunity for helping or control overall cost? Thank you.","Gail Boudreaux","Well, thank you very much for the question. Frank. As I noted in my opening comments, we have a bundle of social determines in addition to some over the counter items that we've also added to our Medicare Advantage beneficiaries across our states and really, which benefit selected is really based [Technical Difficulty] that we have probably the most comprehensive offering and we're really pleased with that. We're very pleased that CMS has also expanded the level of opportunity that can be offered going into this, the next year's Medicare Advantage selling season.","What we do know about those, the reason's that they allow for us to help manage the whole person care again going back to our original strategy and that's \u2013 while it's still early [Technical Difficulty] our Medicaid population that these benefits will ultimately help us manage overall total cost to care and outcomes for our members and also improve our Star ratings. Our quality outcomes are better. I shared with you just the demonstration program that we did here in the Indiana market around Blue Triangle and that's a great example of embedding things beyond just the physical health benefits, but also social issues that impact the people's ability to get care.","So, we did include that bundle broadly and again, which of those specific benefits are taken advantage really depends on [Technical Difficulty]. Thank you very much for the question. Next question please.","Operator","Now to the last question from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Yes, morning. And just a quick cleanup question or two. First one will be just related to medical cost trend, if you could talk a little bit about where you\u2019re seeing maybe pressure versus opportunities, obviously very early in the year and the other aspect was just in Medicaid, you've always had some wins, some Medicaid expansion going forward. Can you just kind of give us a little more color on what you see coming in the year that you already know about as far as certain state expansions, wins, and expected implementation dates? Thanks.","Gail Boudreaux","I\u2019ll ask John first to address your question on medical costs, and then Felicia to share some perspective on Medicaid.","John Gallina","Sure. Yes, thanks, good morning. Lance. In terms of medical cost trend as I think I stated in a previous question. So, we are reaffirming our 6% medical cost trend guidance plus or minus 50 basis points. it really is aligning quite nicely with our expectations. I will take this opportunity to clarify that the 6% plus or minus 50 basis points, does not include any aspect of the implementation of IngenioRx in the second half of the year. Yes, that's a that will obviously benefit our drug costs later in the year and provide benefits associated with a lower pharmacy cost structure. ","However, in order to provide what we think is better clarity, better information and make it easier to understand and model our business, we are going to provide cost trend guidance in 2019 without the IngenioRx implementation, because it's a partial year for just some clients and provide a result that really isn't all that meaningful and then in 2020 we will \u2013 when we provide our cost stream guide to 2020 we will have a full year of IngenioRx baked in. So, it will actually be, I believe far more transparent meaningful the way that we're doing it, but in terms of other issues and trends or areas of concern, after the first quarter, Medical cost trend is very consistent with expectations.","Gail Boudreaux","Felicia?","Felicia Norwood","Yes. Thank you, Lance for the question. As you know, the Medicaid pipeline continues to be very robust. We have three bids that are before us in Louisiana, as well as Minnesota. That will be submitted over the next couple of months, but most recently we're certainly pleased with our win in Washington DC, which was a rebid for us, but having the ability to continue to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in that state is very, very positive for us. So, we look forward to continuing a strong track record, which is over 83% of our wins. When we go out to bid and look forward to continuing to working with our state partners to serve Medicaid beneficiaries.","Gail Boudreaux","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you.

Later there will there be a question and answer session, instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management.","Douglas R. Simpson - Anthem, Inc.","Good morning and welcome to Anthem's third quarter 2016 earnings call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Joe Swedish, Chairman, President and CEO, and John Gallina, our CFO. Joe will offer an overview of our third quarter 2016 results and our updated 2016 full year outlook. Then John will walk through the financial details and provide some incremental commentary on 2017, before Joe closes with some longer term strategic commentary. We will then be available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. This morning we announced third quarter 2016 GAAP earnings per share of $2.30. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.45, consistent with our previous expectations.","Within membership, we continue to post strong fully insured and self-funded enrollment results, as we ended the third quarter with over 39.9 million members. We grew an additional 160,000 lives during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date enrollment growth to 1.3 million lives or 3.4%.","Specifically, insured enrollment increased by 39,000 lives during the quarter, as our Medicaid business grew by 81,000 lives to over 6.4 million members. Since closing the Amerigroup transaction in 2012, we've grown Medicaid enrollment by nearly 1.9 million lives or 41%, including growth of approximately 800,000 lives from Medicaid expansion.","Within Commercial, our insured enrollment came in slightly ahead of expectations, as Local Group fully insured membership tracked well, particularly in the Large Group marketplace. Our public exchange enrollment declined by a less than expected 34,000 during the quarter to 889,000 lives. Our self-funded business increased by 121,000 during the quarter, reflecting the impact of enrollment growth from existing accounts and recently awarded contracts.","Our solid membership results during the year translated into better than expected operating revenue of $21.1 billion during the quarter, an increase of $1.4 billion or 6.8% versus third quarter of 2015. The increase reflects the strong enrollment growth in the Government Business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends. Additionally, administrative fee revenue grew by 6.4% versus the prior year quarter as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. These increases were partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our Commercial business.","The third quarter 2016 benefit expense ratio was in line with our previous expectations at 85.5%, an increase of 190 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the Medicaid business, as higher than expected medical cost experience, notably in Iowa, has exceeded the net impact of annual premium rate adjustments made over the last 12 months. In addition, it reflects the impact of growth in membership, as the Medicaid business carries a higher benefit expense ratio than the consolidated company average. Further, the benefit expense ratio reflects the impact of higher medical cost experience in the individual business. These increases were partially offset by the timing of lower medical cost experience in the Local Group business.","Our SG&A expense ratio was also in line with expectations at 14.8% in the third quarter, a decrease of 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven by an intentional focus on administrative expense control, coupled with better than expected enrollment trends, as well as the changing mix of our membership towards the Government Business, which carries a lower than consolidated average SG&A ratio.","Turning to discuss the third quarter financial performance of our business units.","In the Government Business, we added 92,000 members during the quarter, and grew year-over-year revenue by 10.9% to nearly $11.5 billion. As a reminder, our third quarter results include the impact of the addition of the Iowa contract, which was implemented on April 1.","Operating margins for the Government Business were 4.2% during the third quarter, a decline of 190 basis points versus the prior year quarter, driven by lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. As we communicated previously, we've been expecting Medicaid margins to compress from 2015 levels due to rate actions. In addition, we've been experiencing higher than expected claims across the Medicaid business in the current year, including materially higher than expected costs in the recently implemented Iowa contract.","As expected, there was a rebalancing of funding based on risk pool during the quarter. In addition, we've been informed of a retroactive rate increase, which extends through June 2017 when rates will again be adjusted. Unfortunately, the recent rate increase is still inadequate, given the claims experience to date. We remain confident we can make a meaningful impact by improving the cost and quality of care in Iowa as we've done for our other state partners. However, we will remain disciplined in only participating in markets where we receive rates that are actuarially sound.","Within Medicare, we're pleased with the progress the team continues to make. And our year-to-date margins reflect continued improvement. During the quarter, CMS announced we earned Medicare star quality ratings for 2017 consistent with our long-term strategy. In the most recent ratings released by CMS, 51% of Anthem's Medicare Advantage members will be enrolled in plans that achieve four stars or higher. This accomplishment represents significant growth from the 22% of MA members in four star plans last year. The improvement is the direct result of investments made in the Medicare program over the past 3 years. Our 2016 outlook continues to expect margins to improve as the year progresses towards our expected long range sustainable level.","As we stated since our MA restructuring began, we have positioned our portfolio to grow MA in 2017. The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial with an updated estimate of $81 billion in contracts to be awarded between now and 2021 in markets that we will consider targeting. Approximately three-fourths of this opportunity is in new and specialized services with the remainder in traditional Medicaid services.","We continue to believe our experience, targeted investments in critical capabilities, and geographic footprint positions us very well to continue our growth, as we help states address the challenges of rising healthcare costs and improving quality for their residents.","Switching to our Commercial business. Our enrollment increased by 68,000 lives during the quarter, which was slightly better than our previous expectation. Specifically, we experienced growth of 171,000 lives in our Local Group business, partially offset by declines of 48,000 and 54,000 lives in our National and Individual businesses respectively. These results translated into better than previously expected operating revenue of $9.7 billion, representing growth of 2.4%.","Our third quarter operating margin of 6.6% was flat versus the third quarter of 2015. Commercial operating margins during the quarter reflected a lower SG&A ratio due to lower administrative cost resulting from expense efficiency initiatives taken by the company as well as fixed cost leverage on a growing membership base. In addition, our Commercial business experienced the favorable timing impact of lower medical cost experienced in the Local Group business. These increases were offset by higher medical cost experience in our individual ACA compliant product.","Within our individual ACA compliant plans, costs during the third quarter were marginally better than recent expectation, which is reassuring. We continue to experience higher than initially expected costs from members with chronic conditions, as we've discussed with you previously.","Overall, the financial performance in individual ACA compliant products has been disappointing, as membership has been short of our original expectations since its inception. And operating margins have been lower than expected beginning in 2015. We believe we've taken the appropriate actions across our served markets to return to slight profitability in 2017.","Clearly, 2017 is a critical year, as we continue to assess the long-term viability of our exchange footprint. We will continue to closely monitor this business, and if we do not see clear evidence of an improving environment and a path towards sustainability in the marketplace, we will likely modify our strategy in 2018. We believe both the pricing and regulatory environment need to be improved to drive toward a sustainable and affordable marketplace over the long term.","Relating to National Accounts, which typically encompass the most sophisticated purchasers of coverage, we're pleased that the team continues to secure wins, contributing to the track record of membership growth in 2017. We have added 602,000 lives so far in 2016, building on the growth of over 900,000 lives during the previous two years.","And now turning to our 2016 financial outlook; our third quarter results were largely in line with the expectations we laid out during our last quarter call. We expect our full-year 2016 GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $9.28, including approximately $1.52 of negative adjustment items. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share to be approximately $10.80. We now expect our 2016 operating revenue to be approximately $83.5 billion, which is at the high end of our previously-guided range, reflecting the impact of slightly better enrollment trends during the quarter.","Fully insured membership is expected to be in the range of 15 million to 15.1 million members, or 50,000 higher than our previous outlook, which reflects stronger than previously expected results in the Commercial business. Self-funded membership is expected to be 24.7 million members, which is at the midpoint of our range, unchanged from our previous outlook. Taken together, we are now projecting total membership growth of just over 1.1 million lives at the midpoint of our range versus where we ended in 2015.","Consistent with our expectations last quarter, we expect our medical loss ratio to be in the range of 84.9%, plus or minus 30 basis points; the SG&A ratio to be 14.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points; and operating cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. We continue to expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%.","Our 2016 outlook continues to not include any benefit from the impact of share repurchase activity for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we did not repurchase any shares through the first nine months of 2016. It is important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any additional benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna beyond those incurred in the first nine months of 2016. Nor does it include any benefit from lower pharmaceutical pricing, which we continue to believe we are entitled to under our current contract with ESI.","I will now turn the call over to John to discuss some key financial metrics and our initial thoughts on headwinds and tailwinds for 2017. John?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, Joe, and good morning. As Joe stated, our third quarter results were very consistent with the expectations we laid out last quarter. In order to provide you a bit more clarity on our performance, I will highlight some of our key financial metrics.","First, I'd like to discuss the balance sheet. Consistent with our past practice, we have included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced favorable prior-year reserve development of $773 million, which was moderately better than our expectations. We continue to be at the upper end of our range of mid to high single-digit margins for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balances remain consistent and strong as of September 30, 2016.","Our Days in Claims Payable was 40.6 days as of September 30, unchanged from the 40.6 days we reported last quarter. As previously discussed and consistent with our expectations, this metric has trended down over the past year. And we expect Days in Claims Payable to be around 40 days over time.","Our debt to cap ratio was 38.7% as of September 30, down 40 basis points from the 39.1% at the end of the second quarter, which reflects the impact of an increase in shareholder equity, as we did not repurchase any stock during the quarter. We ended the third quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company. And our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $983 million as of the end of the quarter.","For the three Rs, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to reflect a net receivable position for risk adjusters. We also continue our conservative posture of recording a 100% valuation allowance against any unpaid receivables for the 2014, the 2015, and the 2016 benefit years for risk corridors.","Moving on to cash flow; we reported operating cash flow of approximately $2.9 billion or 1.4 times net income during the first nine months of 2016. During the quarter, we reported operating cash flow of $964 million, which was 1.6 times net income. These results include the receipt of a CMS Medicare prepayment of approximately $650 million during the third quarter. For the full year of 2016, we continue to expect operating cash flows to be approximately $3 billion.","We used $171 million during the quarter for our cash dividend and yesterday the audit committee declared our fourth quarter 2016 dividend of $0.65 per share to shareholders.","Now, turning to 2017; we are currently working through our planning process and analyzing the impact of various expected headwinds and tailwinds. Our current view of the tailwinds include, number one, enrollment gains across Medicaid, Medicare, and National and Large Group self-funded businesses. Two, margin improvement due to improving results in our individual ACA compliant plans, the Iowa Medicaid contract, and the impact of the one-year health insurer fee moratorium in 2017. And three, we expect to resume capital deployment activity in 2017. However, the timing and magnitude is dependent on the timing of the pending Cigna acquisition.","Potential headwinds include the return of the 2017 one-time administrative expense cuts that we made in 2016; the impact of lower Local Group enrollment and gross margin pressures as a result of the migration towards ACA compliant product offerings; and finally, we expect to experience continued margin pressure in the Medicaid business, primarily driven by rate actions within the Medicaid expansion population over the next year.","Taken together, these items are expected to represent modest earnings growth from 2016. As part of our planning process, we will continue to be focused on identifying steps to maximize our opportunities to drive improved earnings growth over time. We expect to provide more details around our 2017 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call.","With that I'm going to turn the call back over to Joe to discuss our longer term outlook.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, John. Three years ago, we laid out our plan for growth, which reflected our strategy to capitalize on the substantial opportunities in the Government Business, while recognizing the changing nature of the Commercial marketplace, as a result of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.","Our plan was to establish a leadership position in the Medicaid market, stabilize our Medicare Advantage platform, and grow individual ACA compliant and ASO enrollment and mitigate the expected pressure in the Local Group fully insured segment.","Since that time, we've been pleased with the growth in our Medicaid business, where enrollment has grown 47% since 2013. And we are well positioned to capitalize on the $81 billion pipeline of opportunity between now and 2021 that I mentioned earlier.","In addition, we have reconfigured and upgraded our Medicare platform, as evidenced by the improvement in our margin profile and star rating performance. We expect to leverage our upgraded Medicare platform to grow MA enrollment in 2017 and beyond.","Overall, the Government Business segment has grown nicely and now represents 54% of our consolidated company revenue, up from 44% in 2013. And we remain very optimistic about continued growth potential in this business.","Switching to Individual, as we've discussed previously, the earnings contribution from the Individual ACA compliant business represents a meaningful headwind to our original targets. The volume shortfall from our previous expectation remains substantial.","For your reference we laid out a plan to grow Individual ACA compliant enrollment to 3 million members by 2018, using the assumption that the overall Individual marketplace would be approximately 25 million members, in line with CBO estimates.","In 2016 the overall marketplace was about half of the expected size. It has only grown to roughly 10 million to 11 million members. And subsequently, we have grown our Individual ACA compliant enrollment to approximately 1.4 million members as of the third quarter of 2016. We are closely monitoring the progress of our actions to improve the margin profile of this business toward our low to mid-single digit margin targets of 2018.","In our self-funded business we've added 4.4 million members since 2013, as our value proposition has resonated with large employers who are focused on quality and affordability. This ASO growth has helped mitigate some of the pressure from higher than expected decline in our Local Group insured enrollment.","Across our Commercial segment overall, we are generally pleased with our aggregate enrollment growth. But the mix of enrollment has skewed more than expected to self-funded than fully insured, pressuring revenue and earnings growth.","Looking ahead, we still have meaningful opportunity to improve the per member EBITDA contribution from ASO by increasing the penetration of our specialty and other product offerings to help further offset pressures in Local Group.","I want to spend a few moments on the pending acquisition of Cigna. We are committed to this combination, which will further Anthem's vision to be America's valued health partner. This is truly a compelling opportunity to positively impact the health and well-being of our members and advance our commitment to expand access to high-quality, affordable healthcare for consumers. It will also save consumers more than $2 billion in medical costs annually, directly benefiting the most vulnerable populations in the country.","I also would like to briefly address the upcoming trial with the Department of Justice, which will begin on November 21. We continue to believe the DOJ's action to sue to block the acquisition is based on a flawed analysis and a misunderstanding of the dynamic, competitive, and heavily regulated healthcare landscape. And we're fully committed to challenging the DOJ's decision in court.","In terms of the court proceeding, the judge has decided to bifurcate the issues and will first hear evidence on the National Accounts issue. If the judge decides in our favor on the National Account issue, we will then move forward and try the other two remaining issues with a decision on those issues being rendered before the end of January.","To summarize, we are in the process of updating our long-term growth plan and expect to target improved core earnings growth rates beyond 2017. The Individual ACA compliant headwinds and our enrollment mix discussed previously represent a meaningful challenge to achieving our $14 earnings target at 2018. And we expect to provide additional clarity around our long-term growth prospects after the Cigna transaction process is complete.","With that, operator, please open the queue for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Due to limited time and in fairness of other listeners, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And our first question will come from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah, hi, thanks. Good morning. My question was about the Individual book. You said that there were losses this year, and they continued into the quarter. Sequentially speaking, what were the losses in \u2013 that you estimated in second quarter? And have they gone up since then? And why are you expecting that'll improve next year when the reinsurance phases out? Are you getting adequate pricing to do that?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Ana, this is John. So thank you for the question. Associated with our Individual exchange business, we certainly did in the second quarter indicate losses. And that we expect that our operating margins are going to be on the mid-single digit loss for the year. Now during the third quarter, the reserve development was okay. The trend had been moderated a bit. And we still expect those losses in the same general range of what we said, maybe just a little bit better than we had indicated.","In terms of 2017 reinsurance is obviously a very important factor, but it's only one aspect of pricing and one aspect of the overall structure of the program. We've got rate increases that average in excess of 20% across the country. I think there's been studies that have been published that have stated that our rate increases are a little bit higher than the average rate increases. We've made adjustments to product offerings, we've changed networks, we've enhanced product designs. We've done many, many things to improve affordability of the specific product mix.","So we feel very good about the previous guidance that we provided that we're really targeting a small profit margin in 2017. And then returning to more closely related to target margins in 2018 and beyond.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, there. Couple things. On Iowa, your language there suggests that you got a rate increase, but it may not be adequate. And that you're disciplined. And you're only going to be in markets that are actuarially sound. Is there an out to get out of that if in fact, we can't get to actuarially sound rates?","And then with respect to Individual, what do you think you need to see in order to feel that there's sustainability into 2018? What legislatively or administratively do you want to see there?","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Christine, good morning, this is Joe Swedish. Yeah. First question regarding I guess the out possibilities. As you know the contract went live earlier this year. And obviously we're very concerned, because it has experienced a deterioration that certainly exceeded our forecast expectations regarding the medical loss ratio.","We are in the process of having deep discussions with the state regarding the possibility of adjustments. I commented in our discussions just a moment ago that we have realized some positive effect from that discussion. And quite frankly, we're hoping for more. Unfortunately, the recent rate increase is still inadequate. And again we're hoping for a better outcome with respect to more discussion.","With respect to the legal construct of the contract, we are examining our position. We quite frankly are waiting for the state to respond to the inquiries that we've submitted to them. And I think it's a little early for us to maybe put commentary out regarding our legal position, given the fact that there's still administrative considerations that are working their way through the system. And we're hopeful for a very positive outcome at the end of that review.","We are concerned about the actuarial soundness of the rates. And that's been expressed by all the MCOs from the get go. We are engaged in an extensive process of meetings, as I've mentioned. And we'll continue to be deeply concerned until we get a resolution to this. And then we'll weigh our options with respect to the end point of those negotiations with the state.","I think the second question dealt with the exchange, Christine? I wonder if you could restate that for me. I'm sorry.","Operator","One moment please.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Sure. And then it sounded like your language suggests that if 2017 doesn't go well, you could change your strategy for 2018. What do you need to see administratively or legislatively in order to fix this and in order for you to feel that this is where you're going to stay for 2018?","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Right. Well on or about mid-year 2017 obviously, we'll be maybe coming to a conclusion on our review about how the adjustments have played out that we're expecting. To your point, what we're looking for are a variety of fixes, such as elimination of the health insurance tax or at least extending the 2017 moratorium. Another one that you probably heard quite a bit about is updating the risk adjustment model substantially to address existing imbalance that we believe deteriorates the overall risk pool.","We are also looking at additional adjustments in the special enrollment periods, which we believe need to be continually narrowed with respect to the variety and number of special enrollments. We also believe that we need to have the flexibility to develop innovative products that should go to market to meet the needs of our customers. Modify the grace period is another great example. And finally, we want to work very closely with the states to ensure actuarial justified rates being approved.","Now what I just specified for you, let me just put a characterization to it that I think it is very important. And that is this is a specific recipe for solutions. And we believe these recipe characteristics represent a form of long-term, sustainable, and an affordable marketplace. So as I said earlier in my commentary, we believe we must see adjustments such that we can easily map to a 2018 situation of sustainability in this marketplace. And quite frankly given what may or may not happen, we'll be evaluating the regional engagement across our markets moving into 2018.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","And, Joe, I'd just like to say, obviously everything there is very appropriate. But, Christine, we will be watching margins, trends, performance on a state-by-state and region-by-region basis in 2017 as well. So certainly the decision in 2018 could be a piecemeal decision as opposed to an altogether decision.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. I think thus far we've been very surgical in our approach, and we'll continue that theme. And so again we have a hope that the sustainability that's expected and commented on quite a bit by leadership of administration actually will occur during the early stages of 2017.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hello, everybody. And I just want to follow \u2013 I appreciate the comments on the headwinds and tailwinds and the comment about modest growth. I guess there are three variables I just want to throw on the table. You're saying you'll go from a mid-single digit loss on the exchanges or in the Individual book to a positive. We got I guess about a \u2013 that would represent I think about a $0.70 swing, roughly 6% to 7% growth in and of itself. I just also wondered are you including anything in your comments about capital deployment when you talk about modest growth or anything on the PBM and what's the latest thinking on that?","And then just to make sure the $10.80 is the baseline number upon which you're assuming modest growth? Or is it some other number that you would adjust for as the starting point for 2016?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. No, A.J., thank you for the question. And in terms of capital, we do expect to resume capital deployment in 2017. However, that won't be until after the pending Cigna acquisition process is completed. And so the timing and the magnitude of the capital deployment is still somewhat of an unknown.","Associated with the starting point, yeah, very clearly $10.80 we believe is the appropriate starting point. That's our guidance. That's been our expectations now for some time. And that's our 2016 \u2013 approximately $10.80 is our 2016 guidance number. And then of course you have the tailwinds that offset that.","But in terms of the PBM, we don't have any of the upside baked in. I think, Joe, maybe some comments, just about the PBM situation in general might be helpful.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah, A.J., thanks for question on that. As I've repeatedly stated, we're hopeful we can negotiate a settlement to our concerns, our dispute. And I don't need to restate what we've said repeatedly about our perspective on our contractual rights.","But let me say that we do believe that we are continually focused on improving the pharmacy pricing on behalf of our customers. We expect to issue a new RFP during the year, that's early 2017, to understand the impact of various pharmacy options available to us, as we migrate to potential of a new agreement.","And I have to underscore that it's critical that we engage with a really trusted partner with aligned interests in advancing cost effectiveness and quality for our membership. I guess we've not ruled anyone in or out in this process of securing an RFP. And I think with respect to any other comments made by ESI or others, we prefer not to comment on that. We do believe that a period of negotiations is still possible. And again, I'll underscore I'm hopeful that we can resolve our differences moving into the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matt Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, thank you. Maybe on a slightly different topic. One of your peer companies has talked in considerable length about pressure in this Small Group ACA compliant book. I know you've alluded to that some. Can you just give us an update on how you see that business? Maybe breakdown in size and breakdown your Small Group between what's ACA compliant and what's grandmothered, grandfathered? And how you see that transition happening, working going into next year?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. Thank you for the question. Very good question. And that really is a meaningful headwind. And I think I did try to highlight it in the script.","But in terms of the specificity of the question, we don't talk about a lot of this information for competitive reasons. But maybe two-thirds of our block is non-ACA compliant today. The grandmothering expires here at the end of the year. And we fully expect to be very aggressive in pursuing and renewing that block of business.","The margin aspect of it may be slightly different, slightly lower as the ACA compliant blocks typically have a slightly lower margin compression. So but we'll ensure that we renew it at appropriate prices and have it to be profitable business on a go-forward basis. But we did want to spike it out as a headwind in 2017.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great, thanks. I guess two questions. First a clarification. You mentioned that as far as the Cigna lawsuit, they're going to break it up in two pieces, and that they're going to do National Accounts first. Just wondering if you had a timeframe for when we'd hear that?","But then specifically on the Medicaid business, sounds like Iowa should get better next year. Medicaid expansion should get worse. Are you looking for net margin improvement or margin pressure on the Medicaid business as a whole in 2017?","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Let me comment on Cigna hearings. Beyond the December judicial process, which we're anticipating a decision sometime on or about mid-December, we would expect that moving forward from there, that's possible then a trial would begin shortly thereafter, probably early January. And our hope is that that would be resolved with a judicial decision by the end of January.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","And then on the Medicaid question, just provide a little clarity. So certainly Iowa is going to be a tailwind into 2017. Yeah. We experienced significant upfront losses in Iowa. And even with the rebalancing of the portfolio and the retroactive rate increase, it still we do not believe is actuarially sound.","And the expectation is that there will be improvement in 2017. However, associated with the remainder of the Medicaid block, we are seeing some slight margin pressure. We were phenomenally successful the past couple years with our margins. And specifically our expansion margins have been very, very, very good. And then as those get repriced throughout the balance of the year, they're going to be repriced at more of a target margin ratio \u2013 or target profit ratio, I'm sorry. And that will create a bit of headwind or margin pressure for us in 2017.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. A couple things. First, I remember back when we were going into the ACA, and there was concerns around Small Group. You guys had put out a number of about a $400 million headwind for next year for the coming couple of years in terms of a Small Group margin pressure. Is there any way for you to do something similar here? Just to give us an idea of as you go through this repricing, is there a number you can point to say here's \u2013 sounds like Small Group's going to be a pretty big prefer (42:26) next year as expected, maybe a little larger than we thought. Is there a way to put a number on that for us?","And then on SG&A, it's been shifting around a bit here. And wanted to get your thoughts for the fourth quarter and how we should think about this for 2017 when we add in the \u2013 when we add back some of these one-time benefits that you had this year? Thanks.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Justin, great questions. In terms of the Small Group we're still working through it. And I really am hesitant to provide an answer until our planning process is done and some of the grandmothering associated with the early renewals that exist. We actually have several of our \u2013 many of our Small Group plans renewed early on December a couple years ago in order to maintain their non-ACA compliant plans. And I think it'd probably be premature to throw a number out until we work through that process. So we will update that and provide more clarity on our fourth quarter call.","Associated with the general administrative expenses, yeah. I think maybe I'll just repeat sort of the commentary from last time. It's down quite substantially in 2016. And a little more than half of it is a good sustainable run rate, meaningful decrease in SG&A expense. That has to do with more efficient processes, better performance in some of the administrative and core areas of the company.","And we grew into our membership. We had a really good membership year from both a membership and premium perspective, raising guidance on that. And we're able to do that by maintaining our administrative expense levels. Obviously then the ratio went down.","The other half, or a little less than the other half, were more one-time items. And those are nonsustainable. And the most significant part of those other \u2013 less than the other half is our incentive compensation plans. As we've stated, we're a pay-for-performance company. And we had our promises to Wall Street and what we expected earnings to be. And we ensured that we delivered those earnings. And unfortunately, we had to lower our incentive compensation expense as part of that process. But so a little less than half come back in 2017.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, good morning. Does your expectation for slight profitability in the ACA compliant business next year assume that the National enrollment is going to be stable or growing? And how would you frame the downside risk to margins if enrollment declines and the risk pool deteriorates?","And also I mean it looks like your relative pricing versus competitors is generally higher in 2017 than it was \u2013 than it is this year after the price hikes and market exits, at least on healthcare.gov. Do you think that provides you any buffer against adverse selection next year?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Well there's quite a few questions in there. Hopefully I can address all of them. But I think maybe the most simple is that we expect that overall Individual ACA compliant membership on a National basis will be slightly down next year. And that our membership will reflect that. We still have many, many competitors in our markets. I just do want to point out that some of the exits that have been very widely publicized, very few of them impact our market specifically. So like for instance, California still has 11 competitors, Virginia still has eight competitors, just to rattle off a couple of our states.","In terms of the risk pool we believe that we understand the risk pool. We're very good at the Individual marketplace. We've been number one in Individual market carrier for years and years prior to the ACA. Our products are designed in such a way to really get a good risk pool that allows us to maximize on risk adjustors and then be a risk adjustor collector. So we feel good about our assumptions at this point in time.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","John, let me add that there are a few key points I think we really need to consider and keep in front. Number one, on average our price point for targeted bronze\/silver plans in the marketplace is higher than our competitors. We certainly recognize that and acknowledge it. And while the number of competitors in our markets has declined overall versus 2016, for the most part those declines are in less populated areas, such as the rural market where we have had historically high market share. There's \u2013 on the flipside there's really still substantial competition across all of our markets, those served markets, most notably in these highly dense urban markets.","And finally, some of the largest markets you'll not see any significant reduction in competition. For example, California still has 11 competitors, down one from last year. Virginia still has eight. Georgia still has five. So we know we're in highly competitive markets. And we believe we will compete very effectively.","But again I think we very effectively managed the price points with respect to the products that we've offered in the marketplace. And so we have a fairly good outlook, as John commented earlier in his remarks, about our expected margins. And as I said then, follow on to that we'll be evaluating our situation in those markets \u2013 all of our markets through the beginning of the year to see how well we perform and how well the regulatory adjustments play out leading up to mid-year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lance Wilkes from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Morning. Just wanted to follow-up on a question with respect to self-insurance margin strategy. Wanted to understand how the progress was going on specialty penetrations, looking at 2017? And what your 2018 and beyond strategies were there? How much upside you saw with respect to self-insurance margins. And then in particular right now with PBM, how does that fit into how you're looking at penetrations?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Great question. And certainly that's one of our growth areas for the future, as we look out into our long-term outlook. We believe that the opportunity to enhance the EBITDA associated with our ASO members is meaningful.","We are developing \u2013 we have ongoing efforts to drive penetration, specialty products, various ancillary-type products, other add-ons. We think that we are under penetrated right now and believe that we have incredible amount of upside. We've been the number one company in growing the ASO Large Group National membership over the last several years. And we've made quite a nice margin percentage on that business. But it's very small dollars.","And so now the focus is to take the fact that we do have best in class discounts. And the most sophisticated purchasers of coverage are picking us. And so now it's our opportunity to really penetrate that better and enhance the EBITDA associated with that membership block.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Just a couple more questions on the Individual business. First, just wanted to follow up. I know you had just said you're anticipating exchange enrollment to decline heading into 2017. I know you also thought that would be the case heading into 2016. So is just your rate positioning why you still believe that might play out in 2017 versus what happened this year?","And then just secondly, could you just comment on any PDRs used in the Individual business this quarter? And your experience with the special enrollment period enrollment this year versus last year?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Sure, Gary, great question. And 2016 was interesting, because what we ended up seeing was a flight to safety. And that was one of the reasons that our 2016 Individual exchange membership grew more than expectations. And so if you go backwards a year, and then you look at the number of co-ops who were in our markets that failed, it was a significant impact on our membership. And then as those customers then went into the marketplace, they \u2013 as I said, it was a flight to safety. They went for Blue.","I think the real key difference in the expectations in 2016 and the expectations in 2017 is really the amount of exits within our markets of carriers and who the exits were and how much membership those that exited had.","So long story short, the co-ops in certain markets were \u2013 had extremely high market share. Then they went insolvent, and their market share of \u2013 when then (52:09) was absorbed. Where in 2017, while we certainly have some exits of carriers in our markets, they do not have the breadth or the magnitude of the market share that the ones who actually a year ago had.","Associated with the premium deficiency reserves, we have none recorded. We had none recorded in 2015. We have none recorded in 2016. It's a very easy question, which means that our results are pure, our results are clean in that we don't have the puts and takes that maybe you have in some of the other companies that you're modeling.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Question \u2013 a short term and a long term. Short term, I heard the commentary. I think, John, you said the results were very consistent with your expectations. And just looking at sort of the cadence of earnings, you saw some mid to high single digit growth in the first half, a big decline of double digit percentage on EPS in 3Q, and now an expected increase back in 4Q. And so I guess if that's all very expected, what changed this year from a seasonality perspective?","And then on the long term, from a strategic perspective when you guys announced the Cigna deal \u2013 and I know we're going back a year and a half now \u2013 you talked about Cigna bringing commercial expertise and exposure to Medicare, the strong specialty, and then the international segment. And so I'm curious kind of where those priorities sit today? And in the case that the judge disagrees with you guys and the transaction does not move forward, how do you guys think about the reaction? Is there a need for scale? Is there an appetite to do other stuff? Thanks.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Sure. Thank you. I'll take the first question, then turn it over to Joe for the second. Yeah. I did say that our results were very consistent with expectations. When you're looking at the seasonality of 2015 to 2016, yeah, 2016 is a bit challenged. The MLR is a little bit higher in the fourth quarter than it was last year. There's a lot of variables associated with that. Clearly the Iowa variable, the Individual exchange variable. Please note that we do have the G&A offset that allows us to enjoy the growth in EPS year-over-year.","But it's not that there was a significant change in seasonality patterns or a huge business flux, as much as it was some of the very specific items that we pointed out to as headwinds for 2016 continue to be headwinds throughout the fourth quarter. On the \u2013 I think Joe wants to address your Cigna question.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah, let me take that for a moment, Josh. First of all, to your point about, call it, pivoting in the event of an adverse decision. We're going to focus very heavily on what we talked about earlier regarding our tailwinds. Obviously, in the MA growth space a very strong focus on our Government business across the entire spectrum and a variety of other initiatives that I've already mentioned.","I think it's really important to underscore that we'll be coming to you at the time of that announcement whenever, we will then share with you our outlook in terms of pivoting the company to tackle some of those opportunities, tailwinds, as well as quite frankly address the headwinds as robustly as we would anyway. But certainly we believe ameliorating some of that risk would be a great opportunity to us as well.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. I would just add to that that we believe that we have long-term sustainable growth opportunities regardless if the deal closes or not. Cigna may help accelerate those. But we're very confident about our future under either scenario.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. Good morning, guys. John, I know you commented earlier about the dynamic of compliant versus noncompliant in the Small Group book. But it looks like in the Individual side, you still have about 20% of your membership that's noncompliant. Are most of those, the plans for the noncompliant individuals going to remain in force through or until December 2017?","And then more of a macro question. Do you guys have a sense for how many grandmothered \u2013 how many people have grandmothered plans in your markets at this point? Thanks.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. No, great question. First of all, in the compliant versus noncompliant, the majority of those will not be noncompliant through 2017. So that the headwind\/tailwind that I talked about with that, that would include both the Small Group and the Individual commentary.","In terms of how many grandmothering are in our markets, including what our competitors have, we actually do not have the specificity of that. But obviously, all the dynamics that we're experiencing and the changes in the laws they're experiencing. So, there's really not a \u2013 if your question is, is there an opportunity to get someone else's grandmothered business, answer is really no. It would have to be \u2013 we would have to get it as part of an ACA compliant product.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. First, just wanted to clarify the comments on the exchange again. Joe, you mentioned 2017 as a critical year. And if there was no clear evidence that you'd sort of modify your strategy in 2018. I mean does that mean market exit or willingness to exit if you're unprofitable again in 2017?","And then also separately, was hoping you could parse out the pressure from Iowa? I know one of your peers took a PDR in that book, while you're absorbing the losses through the P&L. So just hoping to get a sense of margins and maybe magnitude of loss this year? And what the improvement would be next year even on sort of the inadequate rate bump? Thanks.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I will pivot the second part of the question to John, so he can get into some of the technical aspects of it. But with respect to the first question, let me just underscore that as I said a moment ago, we're going to be very surgical.","And let me define market. For those that define market to be state. But I want to be very clear that we deal with a significant array of regions. So we will look at both regional impact as well as state impact, and then make determinations with respect to what I call the surgical assessments and then decisions and execution that are necessary in order for prudent engagement in that marketplace. I believe that probably covers what you were asking. Yeah.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Okay, yes. And then in terms of Iowa and the headwind for 2016, which becomes a tailwind for 2017 with the Medicaid block there. We did get a retroactive rate increase. Unfortunately, we think it's still not actuarially justified.","We really are not providing an exact number at this point, as we continue to work with the state and don't want to get out ahead of the state and negotiate this publicly. But just as Joe said, consistent with the Individual exchange business, we need to partner with states that want to be partners. And we believe that we need actuarially justified rates. And if \u2013 we will continue to negotiate it. We feel very good about that fact. But if we don't get it, then we'll have a decision to make in Iowa as well.","Operator","Thank you and our last question this morning will come from the line of Peter Costa. Please go ahead.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of clarifications on things you said. You said you'd put out an RFP for your PBM in early 2017. So presumably that means we'd see an answer sometime in mid-2017. What sort of things are you going to be looking for besides the $3 billion in savings that you already talked about? And then are you specifically coming off the $100 billion revenue target that you set out in 2014 for 2018?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Why don't I do the second one first, Peter, while I've got the line. In terms of the headwinds, tailwinds for 2018 in Joe's commentary, it's highly unlikely that we would be able to achieve that number at this point in time. Just look at our guidance for 2016 and roll that forward and roll our membership forward.","It all boils down to the exchanges. And the CBO had estimated, what, 25 million, 26 million lives to be insured through the exchanges. When we did our 2018 plan, we relied on some of the CBO estimates as part of our estimation process.","And we're still maintaining our market share. We still believe that we can hit the target margins that we had for those things. But when the entire country has just over 10 million versus that other, that's a significant delta. And that goes straight into our numbers. And I think you'll see that the revenue shortfall can be entirely explained with that dynamic.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah, let me pick it up now regarding the PBM question. Yes, that RFP goes to market early 2017. I've said repeatedly that our intention is to be able to deliver to you a solution with respect to ongoing analytics, which obviously in the current state is significantly impacted by our discussions and of course potential legal proceedings with ESI.","We were hopeful to bring you a meaningful commentary and maybe solution by the end of 2017. We've never diverged from that commitment. And our hope is that we sort of will be able to put all the parts and pieces together to give you clarity in and around the decisions we're going to execute specific to the termination of the contract by 2019.","Operator","Thank you. And please go ahead with any closing remarks.","Joseph R. Swedish - Anthem, Inc.","Well again, thank you, everybody, for your questions. They're always very, very good. As a company, we do remain committed to tackling our healthcare system challenges head on, as evidenced by the work that we've communicated to you today. And we believe that we can and will deliver greater value to consumers by expanding access to high quality affordable healthcare. We've stood by that repeatedly. This is why we are committed to challenging the DOJ's recent decision to block Anthem's acquisition of Cigna in court.","Speaking to my associates, I want to also thank all of them for their continued commitment to serving our nearly 40 million members every day.","To all of you on the phone, please accept our thanks for your interest in Anthem. And we look forward to speaking with you soon at upcoming conferences. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to the Company\u2019s management.","Doug Simpson","Good morning and welcome to Anthem\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Presenting today are Joe Swedish, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayne DeVeydt, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Joe will start with the discussion of our fourth quarter 2014 financial results and the macro backdrop, and then Wayne will review the quarter\u2019s financial highlights in more detail and provide additional commentary on our 2015 outlook. Q&A will follow Wayne\u2019s remarks.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our Web site at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem.","These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Joe.","Joe Swedish","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Our first quarterly discussion since our corporate name change from WellPoint to Anthem. We are pleased to announce strong 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $8.85, as we previewed two weeks ago with membership and margins tracking well in the fourth quarter.","We ended 2014 with 37.5 million members, which was about 250,000 higher than the mid point of our previously guided range. For the full-year 2014, we added over 1.8 million members, representing growth of 5.2% versus year-end of 2013.","Our growth was balanced in 2014 as we added 815,000 Medicaid members, 607,000 National members and 412,000 Local Group members. With attrition in the fourth quarter, as expected, our public exchange enrollment stands at 707,000 members at the end of the year.","Driving our strong fourth quarter results were solid contributions from both our government and commercial divisions. Specifically in the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.80 on a GAAP basis and $1.73 on an adjusted basis.","Our GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share increased from the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by an improved medical loss ratio, administrative expense control, and opportunistic capital deployment.","As we discussed in our preview two weeks ago, we did see an adverse impact in the quarter in the delay of certain Medicaid revenues into 2015, a possibility we discussed on the third quarter call. Additionally, the flu season started earlier than expected. However, these issues were largely offset by the positive underlying financial performance of the business and the recognition of reimbursement of 2014 health insurer fee in Texas.","Further supporting the quality of our earnings, we generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $305 million in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date cash flow to approximately $3.4 billion. We\u2019ve remained focused on our capital deployment strategies as well, repurchasing over 2.8 million shares during the quarter for approximately $343 million and paying $117.6 million of dividends.","For the full-year, we repurchased 30.4 million shares or 10.4% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year for approximately $3 billion at a weighted average share price of $98.52.","Let me turn to providing you an update on business development activity. During the fourth quarter, we advanced our strategic goals with our announcement in December of the acquisition of Simply Healthcare, a Medicare and Medicaid company with a strong presence in the state of Florida.","We have received antitrust clearance from the Department of Justice for the transaction to proceed and we expect to close during the first half of the year. Similar to how we integrated the acquisition of Amerigroup, we expect to maintain leadership to continue growing the business profitably. This is a well-run plan with deep expertise and a local market understanding we expect to leverage for growth.","We expect the transaction to be EPS neutral in 2015, though its financials were not yet included in our forecast. We do expect to grow the business profitably in 2016 and beyond. At the time of announcement, Simply Healthcare had approximately 166,000 Medicaid members and attractive market share in the southern part of the state, which complements our presence in the middle part of the state very well. Once the deal is completed, we will be the second largest Medicaid plan in the state of Florida.","Simply also serves 22,000 Medicaid members through a four-star plan and is positioned to grow. The company has strong provider collaboration agreements in place and a large percentage of their membership is in shared risk arrangements, which help improved care coordination and better managed costs.","Simply also owns and operates a statewide specialty HIV AIDS plan with 9,000 members. This brings us incremental talent and local market knowledge and is indicative of the types of M&A opportunities in which we are interested. In addition to a strong Medicaid business, Simply provides us with a strategic footprint in an important state with a growing Medicare Advantage population. While we continued to capitalize on organic growth opportunities within our businesses, we remain focused on attractive M&A that augments those opportunities as Simply does for us in Florida.","We are also making progress transforming our Company to succeed with new market structures and expanding upon our competitive advantages in our markets. The health insurance industry has started to shift from a historical business-to-business model towards a business-to-consumer model and that shift will continue going forward.","On top of that, new rules in the market have changed the dynamics of how we position our products and put focus on increasing enrollment. As a result, we are intently focused on serving as a protagonist to advance affordability and access for our growing membership.","First, we\u2019re changing the way providers and insurers interact with one another to lower medical costs and include quality for healthcare for Americans, such as our recent agreement with Aurora Health Care, in Wisconsin.","We are leading the way in structuring innovative, groundbreaking agreements with our providers including a focus on value-based payments. Currently we\u2019ve more than $38 billion in spend tied value-based contracts, representing 30% of our commercial claims and approximately 40,000 providers. This includes enhanced payments for performance and shared risk with bundled payment arrangements.","We have 118 ACO arrangements as well as other collaborative efforts such as patient centered medical homes, hospital quality and safety programs, and other partnerships that share financial risk and gain.","We are proud to have taken the lead in working together with our provider partners to move toward a structure that financially rewards activities to improve health, healthcare and affordability. Second, we\u2019re ramping up our efforts around cost of care management including enhanced efforts to comprehensively review our medical cost profile and identify actionable opportunities. This includes establishing line of sight accountability and enhancing trend analytics. Third, we are striving to meaningfully improve the consumer experience by leveraging technology to deliver simple, convenient, and productive experiences to our members.","A recent industry survey by Foresters found that health insurance plan score at the bottom of 13 different industries in terms of consumer experience. The industry has unfortunately held this spot every year since the survey started in 2007. Our goal is to change this dynamic and our strategy is to create and improve customer experience as a distinguishing characteristic of Anthem.","Consumers are assuming a higher cost burden with increased decision-making responsibility and they\u2019ve very specific expectations about how their health plan should serve them. For Anthem, 70% of our plan growth over the next five years is in consumer choice markets.","As part of our focus on the consumer experience, we continue to upgrade our IT capability to drive greater agility and cost efficiency for our Company. This is a multi-year effort to bring our business into line with the needs of our customers. To support that initiative, we recently announced a $500 million deal with IBM for operational services to improve the flexibility and responsiveness of our IT infrastructure. Specifically, IBM will provide operational services for both our mainframe and data servers. Once implemented, we will use both our traditional in-house IT infrastructure as well as IBM's cloud capability to serve our members. This agreement is part of our five-year plan to enhance our ability to respond rapidly to evolving market demands and deliver on our commitment to drive greater affordability for our members.","Additionally, we recently launched an innovation studio center in partnership with Deloitte, which will enable us to rapidly develop new capabilities that are relevant to technology savvy consumers. We need to lead in creating a better relationship with consumers and ensure that we\u2019re improving our ability to serve them in a positive way. We believe an improved customer experience can be a critical point of differentiation to improve retention and customer loyalty, and will support members\u2019 efforts to manage their own health and make informed choices.","I\u2019d like now to turn to discuss our commercial business and the execution of our strategies. Commercial revenues declined in the fourth quarter by 1.9% year-over-year to $9.7 billion, primarily due to the previously announced conversion of the New York State account to self-funded status, which impacted revenues by about $2 billion a year.","Additionally, revenue was pressured by membership declines in small group. These were partially offset by additional premium revenue to help cover new healthcare reform fees as well as self-funded membership growth.","Commercial operating margins improved as expected from 2.6% a year-ago to 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014, due to the changing mix of the product portfolio as we\u2019ve discussed with you previously. Membership trends in the commercial business during the quarter were encouraging as our Local Group membership came in above expectations. This was primarily driven by better than expected growth in our large group business and higher-than-expected retention rates in our small group business.","Our total individual membership declined by 121,000 members during the quarter, primarily driven by an expected membership attrition toward year-end and we ended 2014 with approximately 1.8 million lives. The 3Rs we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate. We\u2019ve also recorded a net payable for risk adjusters and are in a net neutral position on risk quarters. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information.","We expect to continue to refine our estimates in these areas as our 2014 claims data develops over the next few months and the relative risk profile for our various competitors become clear within our markets.","As we discussed last quarter, with respect to our Small Group business, we continue to be mindful of the potential for employer coverage changes in light of the exchanges. In the fourth quarter, we had a meaningful number of small group members up for renewal and we did see small group member decline.","However, the declines were less than expected due to the success of our retention strategies including grandmothering and an improved and competitive position across our markets. Small Group has now declined almost 400,000 members year-to-date and stands at 1.46 million members.","I would now like to turn to the Government segment and speak to the solid fourth quarter results. Our Government business segment added an additional 118,000 members in the quarter, driven by a strong growth in Medicaid and generated revenues of $9 billion, up approximately 17% quarter-over-quarter.","The Government business represented over 48% of our consolidated operating revenues in the quarter, as our business continues to evolve and diversify. Medicaid enrollment was up an additional 116,000 members in the fourth quarter, bringing year-to-date growth to 815,000 members.","We\u2019re very pleased as both organic membership growth and enrollment coming online from recent contract awards exceeded our expectations. Medicare enrollment was relatively flat in the fourth quarter as expected. We are feeling better about our Medicare Advantage membership outlook, but still expect a modest decline in 2015 as we continue to reposition that book of business.","Government operating margins improved 180 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 3.9%. This primarily reflected the impact of various retro rate adjustments as expected during the quarter, as well as the timing issues previously discussed related to the delay in recognition of certain Medicaid revenues into 2015 and the recognition of reimbursement of the 2014 health insurer fee, in Texas.","I\u2019d like to now turn to an update regarding 2015 outlook. We currently expect GAAP earnings per share of greater than $9.30. As we discussed in our third quarter conference call, we\u2019re also going to update how we report adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted earnings per share will now exclude deal related amortization expense as well as realized gain losses. On this basis, we project 2015 adjusted earnings per share of greater than $9.70.","We started 2015 with 37.5 million members, which was better than expected and creates a favorable starting point for 2015 enrollment. For 2015, we expect a continuation of the trends and performance we saw in 2014. In our Commercial business, we expect modest growth in individual with continued pressure in the small group business, albeit less so than in 2014.","We also see strong self-funded growth in 2015 and we\u2019re pleased with our initial trends toward 2016 national account selling season. In the Government business, Medicaid should again be a strong growth driver for us as we will recognize the full-year financial impact of growth that came on line throughout 2014 and the additional membership growth we expect in 2015 from new contract awards. We also expect the progress we\u2019ve made recently in restructuring the Medicare business to positively impact earnings.","We currently expect operating cash flow in 2015 to be greater than $3.5 billion and we expect this to be another active year of capital deployment. As we discussed last quarter, we\u2019ve been evaluating an increase in our dividend payout ratio as a result of our confidence in the cash flow profile of the Company related to the growing diversity of our business. As a result, yesterday our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.625 per share from $0.4375 per share in 2014.","Our dividend has now increased every year since 2011. And subject to market conditions, we\u2019d expect our dividend to continue increasing over time. We will remain disciplined steward of shareholder capital. In the last two years alone we\u2019ve returned $4.6 billion through share buybacks and approximately $930 million through dividends to shareholders. This year we expect to return $2 billion to $2.5 billion through share repurchases and approximately $700 million in dividends to shareholders. We remain focused on appropriately returning capital to our shareholders while ensuring financial flexibility for investment in future growth opportunities and potential M&A.","In summary, we\u2019re proud of our performance in 2014 and believe we\u2019re well positioned for growth in 2015. And Wayne is going to walk you through the details. Wayne?","Wayne DeVeydt","Thank you, Joe and good morning. My comments today will focus on the key financial highlights from the fourth quarter of 2014. I\u2019ll also provide commentary on our 2015 outlook.","On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $1.80 for the fourth quarter of 2014. These results included net investment gains of $0.07 per share. Excluding these items, our adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.73 for the quarter. For the full-year 2014, we reported earnings per share of $8.99 on a GAAP basis, $8.85 on an adjusted basis with the high-end of our previously guided range.","As Joe noted, we\u2019re pleased with our 2014 results and feel well positioned to grow earnings per share in 2015.","Medical enrollment declined by 32,000 members, a 0.1% sequentially to approximately 37.5 million Medical members as of December 31st. This reflected membership declines in our Individual and Small Group businesses, partially offset by gains in our Medicaid and Large Group businesses. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our membership result which were approximately 250,000 higher in the mid point of our previously guided range.","Operating revenue was nearly $18.8 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $1.1 billion or 6.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting enrollment growth in the Government business and additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends and new fees associated with healthcare reform.","For full-year 2014, we reported operating revenues of $73 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion or 4% from 2013, including the adverse impact of the previously discussed transition by the State of New York account and fully insured to self-funded status on January 1st.","Our 2014 revenues were slightly below our previously guided expectations as we were adversely impacted by higher than expected experience rebate accruals in the Medicaid business, as performance was better than expected and higher than expected risk adjusted accruals in the individual business.","The benefit expense ratio was 84.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 330 basis points from the prior year quarter. The decline reflected continued strong medical management and the impact of the premium revenue designed to help cover new healthcare reform fees. We are pleased with gross margin performance on both of our business segments in the quarter and year as we reported full-year 2014 benefit expense ratio of 83.1% at the low-end of our previously guided range.","Our SG&A expense ratio increased by 120 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2013, to 16.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014 as expected largely due to the inclusion of various healthcare reform fees in 2014. For the full-year 2014, our SG&A expense ratio was 15.1% with the high-end of our previously guided range as the Company made investments in areas directly supporting our expected growth into 2015 and beyond including provider collaboration, consumer centricity and medical cost management.","Consistent with our past practice, we\u2019ve included a roll-forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning\u2019s press release. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2014, we experienced favorable prior year reserve development of $542 million, which was modestly better than our expectations. Development was consistent with the prior year-to-date period.","We continue to maintain our upper single-digit margin for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of December 31, 2014. Days in claims payable was 42.5 days as of December 31st, down 1.5 days from 44 days as of September 30th and up 3.8 days from 38.7 days at the end of 2013.","Our debt-to-capital ratio was 38.5% at December 31, 2014, down 10 basis points from 38.6% at September 30th. And we ended the fourth quarter with approximately $2.7 billion of cash and investments at the parent company, and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of $958 million as of December 31st.","Moving to cash flow, we generated stronger-than-expected operating cash flow of $305 million in the fourth quarter, or 0.6 times net income. For the full-year 2014, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $3.4 billion or 1.3 times net income. We repurchased more than 2.8 million shares during the quarter for approximately $343 million, representing a weighted average price of $121.17.","As of December 31st, we had approximately 5.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, which we intend to utilize over a multiyear period subject to market conditions. We used $117.6 million during the quarter for our cash dividend and yesterday the Board declared our first quarter 2015 dividend of $0.625 per share to shareholders.","Turning to our 2015 outlook. We see 2015 as a year of continued growth across our business. We currently expect operating revenues to grow approximately 7% to 8% in 2015 with roughly 2% membership growth across our business.","In Commercial, we expect meaningful enrollment growth during the year. We expect growth of over 200,000 lives for national accounts in 2015 with strong momentum during a quieter year for RFP activity. We also expect growth in Large Group enrollment driven by self-funded contract wins.","We expect modest growth in the Individual business next year. So we expect to maintain our leading market share in our collective 14 states. Our assumptions prove to be conservative, that changes are made to the duration of the short and open enrollment period or for retention metrics developed above our current expectations.","On the negative side, we do expect further Small Group attrition. Though fourth quarter retention rates were better than expected, we\u2019re still forecasting membership decline in 2015 North of 100,000 lives.","For Government, we\u2019re also expecting another strong enrollment growth year. We expect Medicaid to add approximately 300,000 lives, reflecting the addition of new business in the state of Tennessee, as well as continued organic growth in core and expansion products. Within our Medicare business, we continue to expect MA enrollment to decline modestly in 2015 with some offsetting growth in Medicare supplement and dual eligible populations as new state programs go live.","We also expect stable margins in 2015. We currently expect an MLR of 83% plus or minus 30 basis points in 2015 consistent with our 2014 levels. Our forecast does incorporate an expectation for lower Medicaid gross margin after the very strong performance in 2014. However, 2015 MLRs will be favorably impacted by the increase in health insurer fee, which impacts operating revenue and G&A expense.","Related to cost trend expectations, we expect 2015 Local Group medical costs trends to be approximately 7% plus or minus 50 basis points with a return to a more normal utilization trend and higher hepatitis C drug cost.","We currently expect our SG&A ratio in 2015 to be 15.1%, plus or minus 30 basis points. This reflects the impact of the rising health insurer fee in 2015 and investments we\u2019re making to support our strategic initiatives offset by leverage across our business. Below the line, we expect investment income of approximately $660 million and interest expense of approximately $635 million.","We also currently expect our tax rates to be in the range of 43.5% to 45.5% for the year, reflecting a significantly higher health insurer fee in 2015 which is non-deductible for tax purposes. We expect to invest $2 billion to $2.5 billion in share buybacks this year and currently forecast a share count for the year at 270 million to 274 million shares. This is in addition to the $700 million we expect to pay in dividends to shareholders.","To conclude, our 2015 GAAP earnings per share estimate is greater than $9.30. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $9.70. The difference between these two forecasts is the exclusion of the amortization of deal related intangibles as we discussed in our third quarter call.","While we do not offer quarterly EPS guidance, we do expect more than half of our 2015 earnings per share to come in the first half of the year, with the first quarter representing the highest quarterly earnings and the fourth quarter representing the lowest. This reflects both the timing and impact of our membership gain and the accounting related to the exchanges.","Looking out longer term, we believe that 2018 targets remain appropriate and achievable. Our 2014 performance was better than expected and we currently expect 2015 revenue growth with 7% to 8% and operating income growth in the mid single-digit, prior to any health industry fee impact. I\u2019d also note that our current outlook does not yet include Simply Healthcare which is expected to close during the first half of the year.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Joe.","Joe Swedish","Thanks, Wayne. And with that, operator, please open the queue for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Thanks. Hi, everybody. I might just ask you to expand a little bit on some of the medical cost trend commentary. I know in the fourth quarter we\u2019re seeing -- with the fourth quarter release you\u2019re saying the 2014 medical cost trend ended up being about 6.5%. I think in the third quarter commentary, you said it was trending towards the lower end of the 6% to 7%. Is that -- is there a slight variation there or is that just the way the variances in commentary? And then, for the \u201915 commentary, can you flush out the 50 basis point step up? It sounds like it\u2019s mostly hepatitis C, but I just want to confirm that versus other puts and takes and your sense on where the medical cost trend is going?","Wayne DeVeydt","Thanks, A.J. Good morning. Let me first address your first question. As we had said in the third quarter, we did expect trend to be in the lower half of that 6.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. Not necessarily the low end, we had -- we were intension [ph] about the lower half. Probably the one item that surprises a bit in the quarter was nothing to do with core run rate or core medical trend, but really was just the flu season starting earlier than expected in the level of flu that we saw in our markets. But outside of that, really no surprises and had that not occur, we still would have been squarely in the lower half of expectations. Relative to the future medical trend of 7% plus or minus 50 basis points, we do have increased hep C costs in there, but recognize while we got a bit surprised in \u201914 on the level of hep C costs, the actual cost per drug that is included in our medical trend though that you see in the 6.5%. So you already have some of that baked in when we start going into \u201915 and then we\u2019ve added increased hep C cost as well as some underlying utilization that we expect to start returning to a more normal level. So I think all-in, we think we\u2019re finishing \u201914 though in a good spot relative to our pricing going into \u201915. So cautiously optimistic at this point on the pricing that we see into the New Year.","A.J. Rice","Okay, great. Just on that fourth quarter flu commentary, would you say that the flu had a bottom line impact or was there sort of a marginal -- was there pennies involved in impact?","Wayne DeVeydt","I mean it was over a nickel impact versus our expectation. So it gives you a little bit of flavor that, the best being at the high-end of our guided range we actually outperformed it, but it was north of a nickel impact.","A.J. Rice","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.","Joe Swedish","A.J it\u2019s Joe. Just to let you know data we\u2019re tracking suggests that the flu exposure is plateauing if not declining slightly which is sort of given what we see in prior somewhat of a normal trend.","A.J. Rice","Right.","Joe Swedish","So, again we\u2019re optimistic that the plateauing is sustainable.","A.J. Rice","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold","Hi, there. Could you help me quantify some of the Medicaid impacts? I think you had a delay of some of the $100 million that you expected, but then you did get Texas retroactive. How much of what you expect it to get this year is moving into next year versus being realized in the quarter? How do I think about a run rate there?","Wayne DeVeydt","Hi, Christine. Good morning. They\u2019re almost, I mean, within a $1 million an exact offset of each other. So essentially what we pushed into next year the Texas essentially offset it almost dollar to dollar like we said within a few million dollars. But keep in mind; we fully expected to collect Texas. We just weren\u2019t expecting to get the letter on December 31st allowing the reimbursement, so we had assumed that we would get that in January. So in some way to somewhat of a flush it doesn\u2019t affect run rate in the next year because while we did take some of the earnings out of this year and push to next year, we did accelerate the Texas earnings though out of next year into \u201914.","Christine Arnold","And if I understand correctly, you\u2019re looking for the loss ratio to rise in Medicaid. Is that because you\u2019ve kind of maxed out profitability relative to the quarters or is it because you\u2019re seeing some rate reductions or is it the duals? What\u2019s behind your expectation on the MLR for Medicaid next year?","Wayne DeVeydt","I\u2019d put it into three different buckets. The first bucket is we had exceptional performance in our Medicaid to the point that we recorded very sizable risk collars back to many states this year. And so, we are at what I will call optimal margins in certain programs. And we\u2019ve assumed a more conservative outlook on that, although I would again indicate that underlying trend seems to be playing well. So hopefully that will prove to be at least a prudent may be a conservative outlook. The second thing I\u2019d say is we\u2019ve new states we\u2019re expanding into. So in the case of Tennessee, we\u2019re expanding into new markets and we\u2019ve many expansion lives coming on. And so as we typically deal with new membership coming in, we automatically assume a higher MLR and a lower margin. And so that\u2019s putting a little bit of pressure on the overall margins. And then the last thing is just that as we continue to build out capabilities for the new growth pipeline we see out there, we\u2019re putting some more G&A investments into new states that we expand -- or planning to expand in and hope to win. And that puts a little bit of short-term margin pressure on it, but it\u2019s for a longer term revenue and operating gain. But all-in Christine, I mean, we -- I\u2019d say if there is a reason for margins to go down, this could be the -- this is the right side of the track to be on.","Christine Arnold","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Lake from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks, good morning. First, on the individual book specifically the exchanges, it sounds like your corridor accrual if I\u2019m -- I was hearing correctly went from positive in the third quarter to flat in the fourth quarter. And then, I think you actually -- you might have said risk adjustment also may have moved negative in the quarter. So I just wanted to get some update on the individual book margins and those puts and takes?","Wayne DeVeydt","Hi, Justin. Yes, really good question. A lot of moving parts here, more complicated than it should be, but let me try to make it a little more simple. On the risk corridor, yes we had a very slight receivable. We chose to book 100% valuation allowance against that slight receivable, so obviously our concern is whether collectability will ultimately be there. So we are more at neutral, but it's not moving the needle for us. We didn't have a receivable as you know our profitability in the books have been quite good so, and it's based on a market by market. So it was more conservative posture to put a valuation allowance against the collectability of that receivable. Obviously, that proves to be collectible then it\u2019s very modest outside though. Relative to the risk adjustors, I think we\u2019ve decided as a Company that we had a lot of new data points that would imply that we could have a more sizable payable. The [indiscernible] data at 9.30 would have implied that we had a net receivable. As you know we booked a 100% valuation allowance against that as well under the premise that that could switch and change. And so, we hope that will prove to be conservative that we chosen a book of payable at 12.31 and if it does prove to be a conservative that will be upside to 2015.","Justin Lake","And so where are the margins, are they still shaking out around that 3% range?","Wayne DeVeydt","We are north of 3%.","Justin Lake","Okay. Is it closer to 4% to 5%?","Wayne DeVeydt","Yes, I would say our targeted margins of 3% to 5%, we\u2019re well within the higher end of our targeted margins.","Justin Lake","Okay. And then, just a follow-up on the Government business, specifically, how do we think about that $100 million give or take that\u2019s going to be received in 2015? Would we think about that as kind of a one-time benefit so as we think about the growth rate off 2015, would that be a headwind, Wayne, given that it's attributable to \u201914?","Wayne DeVeydt","No, I think the one thing, Justin, the reason we don\u2019t view it as a headwind is while its attributable to \u201914, we really have these type of items happen to us just about every single year. What was a little bit unusual was to have north of $100 million in timing occur, so the good news was with us collecting a little bit more than half of that, you really got back to a point where it was back to what I\u2019d call more of a typical run rate of what kind of flows from year-to-year. So I\u2019d say from our perspective we\u2019re not really concerned about it and unfortunately, I guess, that we will probably have another $50 million in \u201915 that probably will ends up in \u201916 so -- and we\u2019ve assumed that in our outlook, in our plans. So I think we\u2019re more in a run rate now.","Justin Lake","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch","Yes, good morning. Can you tell us what your outlook is on the Medicaid rate updates and the rate resets, and maybe if you can breakout where you expect development on rates that are specific to the Medicaid expansion populations versus the existing pre-expansion business?","Wayne DeVeydt","Good morning. I would say the Medicaid rate environment, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. Still lot of moving parts there, but we\u2019ve been successful in our rate negotiations. As you know many of the rates at least going into \u201915 were finalized in \u201914. Now obviously we\u2019ll go through a new rate cycle beginning second half of \u201915. In general I think we\u2019re optimistic about the rates that we were able to achieve. We think we\u2019ll continue to have industry leading margins, but we think that\u2019s because we provide an industry leading value in terms of the overall cost we provide to the state, and I think that\u2019s the important part to keep in mind. The other thing to keep in mind Matt is that we had sizable callers in the hundreds of millions of dollars in terms of better than expected performance. So those callers serve as a reasonable buffer to future trend if it was to occur relative to the rates as well. So, all in, I would say we really like our chances on the Medicaid front and how we\u2019re addressing new populations and I think the Medicaid team has really done an exceptional job managing this very unknown environment in about an optimal ways you could possible be.","Matthew Borsch","Sorry. Can you just remind us how the callers worked, does that mean that you\u2019re paying money back to the states when you\u2019re outperforming?","Wayne DeVeydt","That\u2019s correct, Matt. So to the extent that we achieved MLRs below a certain threshold, we\u2019re writing a check dollar for dollar back to the state. And so I think again the point we wanted to make was, we finalized our rates but even in finalizing those rates has also seen sizable callers that were going back from this year. So, there\u2019s a bit of a buffer there that if for some reason the rate would be deemed inadequate, keep in mind you would have to burn through a lot of caller activity that we\u2019ve had this year as well before you ultimately get to a point of being short on rates. So -- but yeah, our MLRs and many of our expansion markets came in south of what those minimum floors were.","Joe Swedish","This is Joe, again. I also want to underscore another part of the equation, because there is the rate situation or negotiations that goes on, but also I think its fair to underscore aggressively we\u2019re pursuing medical cost management as a contributor to how we better manage that book as well as others. Specifically building out data analytic capabilities, really a passionate commitment to effectively managing the medical cost trends I think really benefits us over the long-term. So, it\u2019s really sort of a two sided coin here in terms of rate negotiations as well as medical management both cost focused.","Matthew Borsch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Rigg from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the individual comments with you\u2019re seeing modest growth for 2015. Can you give us a sense for sort of the churn or retention rates in that business versus new member adds? Thanks.","Wayne DeVeydt","Hi, Chris. So, first let me comment on the modest growth. We are still seeing relative to the new lives coming into the system, us getting our mid 20% range market share. So, I do want to first start with, this is not a growth store issue around new lives coming in. And I would say retention has been decent, I mean, kind of what you would expect with an individual book. What we are seeing now, and part of the reason for the more modest view is, overall employment in the economy is starting to improve. And as that starts to improve, individuals start getting jobs, and as a result they drop their individual healthcare coverage. And so, the one thing that we feel good about though is that, we still think we\u2019ll have modest growth. If the economy really does take off though and we saw that gets more flattish or even slightly down, we have got a pretty big catchers net with the way our book is build. And so, ultimately we will most likely pick up much of that membership in either a large local group business or a national account business. So, I view it a little fungible regarding the growth, but I think we still expect modest growth. But if the economy really takes off, that could decline. But again we would expect to have offsetting beats in other lines of business.","Chris Rigg","Okay. And then, the follow-up is just on Medicare Advantage. Understand the comments on 2015, but assuming the rate environment for \u201916 remains reasonable. Do you think you can grow that business next year? Is the repositioning essentially down at this point? Thanks.","Joe Swedish","Yes, this is Joe again. We have stated that we do expect a slight decline in membership for MA for \u201915 and again that\u2019s a continuation of the repositioning of that portfolio, so that it -- it does become a solid performer for us going forward. It builds a great foundation in terms of adding membership in key markets in an effective way given the business model we build out. Our sense is that, going into \u201916 obviously we\u2019re looking forward to a combination of organic growth and the potential of M&A activity similar to what we just announced regarding Simply Healthcare in Florida. So, we\u2019re very mindful of M&A opportunity, and also just basically organic growth I think will continue to be a great benefit to us. So, I think net-net we\u2019re going to be well positioned for what comes our way and we\u2019re very optimistic about our potential going forward in MA.","Chris Rigg","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sarah James from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Joe Swedish","Sarah, are you there?","Operator","It looks like we lost her line. So, we\u2019ll go to Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","Yes, thanks. Good morning. I was just trying to see what other puts and takes in your 83% consolidated loss ratio guidance for 2015 across commercial and if any color on small and large group like changes in Medicare and Medicaid?","Wayne DeVeydt","Well, I think relative to the overall guidance in the MLR, generally pretty stable for the year across all of our lines of business, no real outliers. We\u2019re expecting to maintain our margins in general across various books, but we see margin declamation. Again it more like what we talked about on the Medicaid in terms of some new markets and some new investments versus what I would call real pressures. Again we think we priced right, that\u2019s the key, and we priced for a rising trend. And we -- again our starting point is good at this point, and its really in the year, but January cash flow seems to be at least supporting our assumptions at this point, so, more to come. But I would simply say that, as you look to the various businesses in 2014 it will be a very comparable MLR for each of the lines of business in 2015.","Ana Gupte","So, just to follow up then, Wayne does small group, is the margin compression done at this point and secondly on your reserve expectation you\u2019ve been remarkably stable for three years on the 500 plus that was assumed into guidance?","Wayne DeVeydt","Yes. So, two things; one is on the small group. We really expect this to be the last what I would call more meaningful wave of attrition and margin compression that would occur. So, from a membership perspective we are assuming we\u2019ll loose north of a 100,000 lives in \u201915, and we have about $100 million of EBIT headwind this year as a result of that margin compression. But in essence after this year we\u2019re kind of on a very flat to growth trajectory again. So, that is included in our outlook and our guidance. The second part of your question, on the blank what it was.","Ana Gupte","The reserves, it was like 540 I think you said that in your prepared remarks.","Wayne DeVeydt","Yes. Thank you, Ana. And we have assumed no reserve releases in our outlook or anything of that sort. We would expect reserves to develop very similar in \u201915, now what you have seen in \u201914 and \u201913 et cetera. So at this point, if that proves to be conservative then that would be an upside to our earnings outlook as well.","Ana Gupte","Thanks, Wayne. Very helpful.","Wayne DeVeydt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Scott Fidel from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. First I just had a question just following up on individual and the modest growth that you\u2019re expecting. How would you expect that, that\u2019s going to break out between on-exchange growth as compared to off-exchange attrition? Then just interested in terms of what you\u2019ve seen so far in terms of how the rest of the mix is developing for year two, and how those new joiners that are coming into the exchanges this year appear to be looking from a risk profile perspective?","Wayne DeVeydt","Thanks, Scott. So, let me start with the individual market on the modest growth. I would say really it\u2019s somewhat fungible between our on and off exchanges at this point. Everything seems to be kind of holding the line as the year develop, so nothing really crazy. I mean, I would say on-exchange is going to grow and we\u2019re getting new market share and off-exchange will have some attrition, but similar to what we saw in \u201914. Relative to new entrance and new markets, I guess what I would say is, in general pricing seems to have stabilized more. We\u2019re not seeing as wide of the variability or variation in pricing as we saw in \u201914 and it seems that there has been a bit of a regression to the mean in terms of pricing which is a positive. We continue to see some outliers, generally new interest that we scratch our heads on in terms of the pricing and, so that may slow some of our growth in certain markets for a short period of time But we think over time that similar pricing has to prevail, because if it doesn\u2019t, financial solvency becomes an issue, and so, we for those other entities. So, I think in general we think industry is handling a very unique and unknown environment in the right way with pricing. We\u2019d like to see the regression in the mean and I think as the Three R start to dissipate over the next couple of years, I think you\u2019re really going to see rational pricing come even into play.","Scott Fidel","Okay. And then just, I had one follow up, and just with Simply now coming online in Florida and then you have obviously the Amerigroup platform already there in Florida. How do you view the positioning of the government platform for Anthem now in Florida after the Simply acquisition? Do you feel like, you\u2019ve now got the pieces in place for Florida or do you feel like you\u2019d need to do sort of further actions in order to get it to where you would want to be long-term?","Joe Swedish","Yes, it\u2019s a great question. Thank you. Simply, I assume you\u2019re aware of the -- of this growth dynamic we created for ourselves by now becoming the second largest player in the state of Florida which is a very solid position especially South Florida combined with the regions we\u2019re already performing in. So, our sense is that we\u2019re extremely well positioned in Medicaid going forward especially if there is the prospect for expansion in that state becomes a reality which obviously is still somewhat speculative. So, again I think we\u2019re very well positioned in that regard. I hope that answers your question.","Scott Fidel","I\u2019m sorry, Joe. I was sort of meaning the combination of Medicaid and Medicare just in terms of Simply\u2019s Medicare capabilities ...?","Joe Swedish","Yes, and excuse me I should have kind of weighed in on Medicare as well, because that really gives us a good foot hold in a very dynamic state regarding Medicare or MA membership and it\u2019s potential. So obviously we certainly intent to leverage our new found position in the state, especially given the fact that we\u2019ve got some very expert management associated with Simply that will be coming into the company. We fully intent for that leadership team to continue to support Simply and the overall footprint that we have in the state. So, I think we\u2019re very well positioned for growth going forward in both MA and Medicaid.","Scott Fidel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll go to the line of Sarah James from Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you and I apologize about the technical difficulties earlier. There has been a lot of talk about the price ticking behavior of exchange members. And now that we are in year two, can you talk about, how you\u2019re seeing that balance against brand loyalty or consumers just not wanting to re-bid every year, so giving us a sense of the overall stickiness of the book.","Joe Swedish","I\u2019ll take a shot at it first by simply saying that I think stickiness is real. It certainly has played out as we expected. Given our entry last year migrating into the second year, I think stickiness has played out particularly related to our Blue Cross Blue Shield brand identity in our 14 states where we have played. So, our sense is that, that certainly has been a so called asset for us. So our strategy is playing very well with respect to our pricing model and especially leveraging our brand identity in all the markets that we serve. We really like our position going forward in the market regarding how we priced and obviously continuing to leverage our brand identity. So, long story short, stickiness is real. We believe its sustainable and, but I do want to underscore that, certainly is the determinant as well and we\u2019re very mindful of the combination of pricing, brand and network configuration being three core ingredients regarding how people will make their decisions going forward. But again I think brand stickiness is a significant driver and will remain so for the foreseeable future.","Wayne DeVeydt","Sarah, one thing we want to add to Joe\u2019s comments is that, our strategy was not a \u201914 strategy. It really was a post Three R strategy and where we wanted to take our organization. And so, I think one of things too to keep in mind is, having a first year mover and a first mover advantage, we think is meaningful. But we think the ultimate value, that value proposition and how that affects pricing over time and how that a price affects market share, really it can't be measured until you get closer to \u201917 and \u201918, because when you think about the unknown to Three R\u2019s, if those still haven\u2019t been settled and they\u2019re not getting settled until probably second quarter of \u201915. So, I still don\u2019t think people can say that they had complete visibility on all of the factors that affect pricing. And so, I think from our perspective though, we have taken a conservative posture on all those factors. We\u2019ve priced well in the first year, we have achieved all of our margin goals that we set for ourselves as a company, and we know what the consumer makes decisions on beyond just price, including brand and product design, and we have really learned a lot in this first year. But keep in mind, this is a multi-year strategy and we\u2019re going to have to trudge through a few years, but we still think of some irrational behaviors. But once those pass, we really think the value of this strategy is really going to shine when you get out to the \u201916, \u201917, \u201918 time periods.","Sarah James","I appreciate all the color. And if I could just clarify one comment from earlier. The $0.05 of flu, how did that fall between Medicaid and Commercial?","Wayne DeVeydt","So, it was north of $0.05 and it\u2019s roughly split, fairly evenly between the two.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Thomas Carroll","Hi, guys, good morning. Also just a clarification on some prior discussion. The Medicaid rate retro payment in Texas, I think you guys were expecting to get paid for the tax. But you hadn\u2019t explicitly assumed the gross up. So, is that something that we should consider here in terms of kind of a run rate discussion kind of what Christine was getting at? Maybe that\u2019s a nitpick, so I apologize for that. And then secondly, kind of a high level question on your outlook. The press release and this call seem to be very favorable and the outlook seems to suggest if you look on a, your old methodology basis, kind of a 5% EPS growth over 2014 level. So if I\u2019m doing the math correctly, it seems like you could double that on repurchase and capital deployment alone. So, I guess the heart of my question really is, where do you feel like you could see points of concern in 2015 that may hold things back more or is there just a good bit of flexibility in your outlook?","Wayne DeVeydt","Good morning. Let me start with your gross up of Texas, I mean that\u2019s a good point. So, we did not assume that we would get the non-deductibility to tax initially in our outlook, so that was upside to us relative to Texas. But again if you were to take the actual model received plus the gross up, it literally is within a few million dollars of that amount that got differed to next year on some of the retro rate stuff. So again still on that flush from that perspective.","Thomas Carroll","Okay. Good.","Wayne DeVeydt","Relative to outlook, it\u2019s a very fair question, is what I\u2019ll start it with. I want to highlight that as you know, we do have a 40% increase in the industry tax this year which we want to manage through. We have many investments that we are making for the long-term all around growth, both in our commercial and our government businesses. And those are reflected in here as well as many investments that Joe has really pushed the pedal to the floor on around shutting down the system platforms and other items, things that will really drive value into \u201916 and beyond that you cannot see in the \u201915 outlook. And then lastly I would simply say, we have the small group headwind of north of $100 million of EBIT. But all that being said, core operating gain is still growing very meaningfully with that. And I would say that, we feel that we\u2019ve given the least prudent guidance of a greater than number and if, we don\u2019t need a lot of things to fall our way. We just need to make sure that we maintain our conservative posture and we could have opportunity for our performance. But three weeks into the year, so lots still due and our job is to execute with the agility as a lot of these unkowns become known.","Thomas Carroll","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thanks. I just wanted to go back to the small group commentary, it sounds like you guys feel like it will be through the margin compression in 2015. But just trying to understand I guess two things, one is whether if you had any conversations with those customers, those who have not yet dumped, whether there is any view that the risk that they will dump increasingly in the future, is there -- or whether this is something that really isn\u2019t heard, haven\u2019t turned out to be the issue that people thought that might be just trying to understand. I know you have re-priced the margin between the two, but clearly there is a risk about re-capturing those members on the exchange if they do in fact dump. And then second, any issues at all in the kind of the 50 to 300 range. It wasn\u2019t, its never been 100% clear to me why you guys felt like there wouldn\u2019t be at least some pressure in the 50 to a 100 range, and why kind of the $400 million was only related to that, to the small group?","Wayne DeVeydt","Kevin, let me start with the first part of your question which was, we\u2019re having discussions with our customer\u2019s conversations around this, I mean, and the answer is absolutely. I think its -- and these questions kind of go hand in hand, the two comments you raised. I mean it\u2019s important to recognize though that, that generally speaking for a company that has fewer than 50 employees just the economics, the math of their business models would generally imply there is a value benefit to them moving to a public exchange versus not. And as you get to a larger size employer, that value benefit diminishes. And so, one is, there\u2019s just an economic play that we think an employer can look at. Two is, because there is no penalty for dropping coverage below 50 lives is also a natural incentive then for employers to not only evaluate the economics but recognize there is not a penalty for not providing coverage\u2019s of some sort. So, we have regular discussions with our customers. We were very pleased with our retention of small group renewals in December, and we hope that gives us a little bit of a positive starting point going into \u201915. But I would say though that, its not just about small group retention, because again we set up a lot of customers in small group, it\u2019s about margin compression. And I think that\u2019s the other part people have to remember though is that, there is an alternative available now and that alternative has lower margins than what we have in small group and our goal is to make that alternative fungible between the two. And then, in the 50 to 100 segment, in general our market share has been relatively stable. In some spots we have lot a little bit of market share but nothing that\u2019s really concerning and I think -- we actually think we\u2019re going to start growing in that area now that we\u2019ve seen some of the shakeout of exchanges.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Then maybe just to clarify, because again to the extent that we do see again you could be agnostic margin wise between the two products, but any color you have on how you think about your local market share in the small group or even up to a 100 versus the exchange market share? Is it reasonable to assume that you would capture your fair share of that membership that moves in or is there potentially a risk from a membership perspective if there was somehow a wholesale dumping or a larger scale dumping than we\u2019re seeing now?","Joe Swedish","We really like our chances on maintaining even the market share that we have between the two and that our catchers they kind of pick some up wherever they fall. But I want to clarify; I\u2019ll caveat my comment with one thing. Not necessarily all in one year though. And the reason I said that is again, we still see some players in certain markets that we think have to get right sized on pricing, and so as we\u2019ve seen Kentucky and a few other markets, we understand that we may not have the market share we had and then as people move from one bucket to another we may not maintain that market share. But we think overtime that sustainability to the market comes and as the Three R start to dissipate, and we\u2019ll see that market share come back in. So, obviously for \u201914 we think we\u2019ve accomplished that goal quite well. We\u2019re assuming we\u2019ll do something similar in \u201915, and -- but we really think you\u2019ll see potential growth in beyond our market share as we get to a more stable environment through the end of \u201916.","Kevin Fischbeck","That makes sense. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question this morning will come from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Thanks for squeezing me in at the end here. Can you guys talk a little bit more about private exchanges and what you\u2019ve seen happening there between 2015 and 2016 selling season? Where do you think that\u2019s going at this point and then also, the second question around your PBM structure? Do you see that evolving this year in any way shape or form from what you have used in the past?","Joe Swedish","This is Joe, I\u2019ll take on private exchange and then Wayne you can pick up on PBM. We have been, I think well positioned regarding private exchange formation for go-to-market effort. We have been believer now for quite some time that there is going to be a relatively slow uptake on private exchanges, and I think in fact that has come to pass. We have had about 100,000 members in the private exchange space for quite some time. Having said that though, I think we\u2019re extremely well positioned because we do believe that there will be an inflection point in the not too distant future where there probably well be an increasing interest in private exchanges, so I think this moment in time has given us tremendous opportunity to prepare. Get aligned with a variety of interest in the market that are advancing various models. So long story short, I like our chances when that moment comes and I think that, the private exchange market place has potential albeit it\u2019s been a slow uptake. So, it\u2019s out there, we\u2019re ready and I think we\u2019ve got the experience that\u2019s necessary to actively engage when that moment comes.","Wayne DeVeydt","Pete, relative to the PBM, let me first start by saying that similar to what we said in our Investor Day last year, we continue to expect significant value for our members and our shareholders regarding our PBM and its value that, that the question really becomes a matter of win not if we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll begin to hopefully garner some of this value for our shareholders and members sooner than later. But we obviously don\u2019t discuss our relationships or any negotiations regarding those relationships in a public environment for competitive reasons. But in general, our goal is to ensure that we get all the rights that were allowed into our contract and to also ensure that those values go to not only our members but our shareholders.","Peter Costa","Is there market check explicitly in your contract?","Wayne DeVeydt","Yes.","Peter Costa","Thank you.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference back to company\u2019s management for any closing remarks.","Joe Swedish","Thank you for your questions everyone. We\u2019re pleased with the operational performance last year. It clearly was a year of substantial change to our markets and our associates I believe have done an impressive job of navigating the market rules and executing on our strategies. I also believe we\u2019re making progress in advancing our positions in the market with respect to core elements, such as provider collaboration, cost of care management and our ever increasing focus on the consumer experience. While we made progress in these areas, there is substantial room for further gains. I\u2019m really confident that we are appropriately focused on our long-term market position. Our structure, leadership and strategy are all pointed in the right direction. We are targeting further growth in 2015 and beyond and really remain optimistic about the meaningful opportunities across both of our business segments. I\u2019d like to thank all of our associates for their efforts that drive our company success and importantly our transformation into a performance-based culture.

I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management.","Douglas R. Simpson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning and welcome to Anthem's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This is Doug Simpson, Vice President of Investor Relations. With us this morning are Joe Swedish, President and CEO; and Wayne DeVeydt, our CFO. Joe will offer an overview of our third quarter 2015 financial results and Wayne will walk through the financial details and our updated 2015 outlook. Joe and Wayne are then both available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com.","We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. We're pleased to announce strong third quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $2.73, reflecting solid underlying membership and margin performance. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.43. We're pleased with core operating results in the quarter, which came in modestly better than we had expected and is reflected in our updated 2015 outlook. Of special note, the third quarter did benefit from the favorable timing of retro rate activity true-ups in the Medicaid business and company-wide administrative expense. These were intra-year timing issues that are not expected to impact our full-year results.","Performance in our Government business and National, Large Group and Small Group businesses in Commercial are tracking well versus our expectations, while our Individual business continues to lag as a result of lower than expected involvement. We ended the third quarter of 2015 with 38.7 million members, an increase of 174,000 members during the quarter, bringing year-to-date growth to 1.2 million members or 3.2% since year-end 2014. This reflected membership increases in nearly all lines of business, with the exception of lower Individual membership. We added 670,000 Medicaid members, 401,000 National members, and 111,000 Local Group members.","Operating revenue was nearly $19.8 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $1.4 billion, or 7.6% versus the third quarter of 2014, reflecting enrollment growth in the Government business, additional premium revenue to cover overall cost trends and increasing fees associated with Health Care Reform. Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully-insured membership losses including the previously announced decision to discontinue our employer group Medicare offering in the state of Georgia account.","The benefit expense ratio was 83.6% in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of 110 basis points from the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase reflected the change of our business mix towards the Government business division and the impact of last year's intra-year reserve development related to the exchange business. As we previously discussed, we expect our benefit expense ratio to increase further in the fourth quarter, consistent with previous expectations.","On a year-to-date basis, our MLR has improved by 70 basis points in 2015 versus 2014 to 82% with improvements in both business segments contributing to the change. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect underlying Local Group medical costs trend to be in the range of 7% plus or minus 50 basis points, with a bias towards the lower half of that range.","Our SG&A expense ratio decreased by 60 basis points from the third quarter of 2014 to 15.6% in the third quarter of 2015. The improvement largely reflected the changing mix of our membership toward Government business as well as the timing of certain expenses, including information technology spend that we now expect to incur in the fourth quarter.","I would now like to discuss our Commercial business in greater detail. Commercial membership has increased by 464,000 since year-end 2014. Operating revenues increased 0.7% sequentially, but have declined by 3.8% since the prior year quarter to $9.4 billion. This reflects fully insured member declines including the decision we announced last year to discontinue our employer group Medicare offerings in the state of Georgia account.","Self-funded membership trends continue to be encouraging, increasing by another 209,000 during the third quarter and now up 919,000 versus year-end 2014, representing growth of 4%. This was primarily driven by better-than-expected growth in our Large Group business. Large Group and Small Group insured membership in the Commercial business were down slightly in the quarter, as expected. Small Group ended the quarter with a total membership of 1.33 million lives.","Individual insured business membership continues to lag our expectations this year, and we have seen the volume and related margin pressures weighing on our profit contributions. Individual membership declined by 99,000 during the quarter as we continue to see contraction in exchange lives and some attrition off-exchange. Our exchange membership declined by an additional 69,000 lives to 824,000 members. Year-to-date, our Individual business has declined by 48,000 lives, meaningfully behind our original growth expectations for this year, as we have discussed previously.","Individual enrollment pressures in 2015 reflect much lower than expected aggregate market growth as well as unsustainable pricing by some of our competitors. While we are disappointed with the near-term enrollment picture, we believe we have the right medium to long-term strategy with the exchanges and will continue to target sustainable pricing in our markets. Over time, we believe we are well positioned for growth as this market stabilizes to a more sustainable level.","We have a solid pipeline for National Accounts and continue to expect solid growth in this area in 2016 with several large new accounts already closed representing several hundred thousand lives. For the 3Rs related to 2015 benefit year, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate, and continue to expect to be in a net payable position for risk adjusters and in a net neutral position for risk-corridors. We continue to record a valuation allowance against the risk-corridor receivables in certain markets as we do not believe those receivables will ultimately be collected. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information.","I would like to now turn to the Government segment and speak to the solid third quarter results. Our Government business segment had another strong quarter, adding 108,000 members, driven by strong organic growth in Medicaid. Revenues are up approximately 20.8% versus the prior year quarter to $10.3 billion. The Government business' year-to-date membership growth of 738,000 members has exceeded our expectations. This growth includes 670,000 members added in Medicaid, 37,000 in Medicare, and 31,000 in our Federal Employee Program. Please note that these results include membership associated with Simply Healthcare.","The pipeline of opportunity for our Medicaid business remains substantial. We expect $68 billion of new business to be awarded by the end of 2020, split about evenly between traditional Medicaid and new populations in specialized services. We continue to believe our experience and footprint positions us very well to continue our growth as we help states address the challenges of rising healthcare costs and improving quality for their residents. We are pleased to have announced, during the quarter, that we were awarded the opportunity to offer Medicaid services for the state of Iowa and Texas STAR Kids as well as successfully retaining our business in Georgia and Kentucky.","In Medicare, we are pleased with our progress on Star Ratings and expect over 25% of our Medicare advantage members in 2016 to be in Four-Star plans, which impacts 2017 revenue. We remain focused on improving affordability for our members as we plan to offer zero premium HMO and PPO products, where possible, in 2016. We will continue to refine our served markets opportunistically, and we are optimistic that we are getting closer to a positive growth inflection. We know that we must be focused on managing the total cost of care to offer a competitive product, and we will continue to make the necessary investments to improve our capabilities.","Overall, Government operating margins improved 280 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 6.1%, ahead of our expectations. This reflected continued strong medical cost performance in certain markets in the Medicaid and Medicare businesses as well as the favorable timing of retro rate adjustments recorded during the quarter for certain Medicaid contracts.","Next, we want to provide a brief update on our pending acquisition of Cigna. During the quarter, we filed our S-4, and we are in the process of responding to the second HSR request by the Department of Justice. We also continue to work with our state regulatory representatives to address their questions. Both Anthem and Cigna shareholder meetings to approve the acquisition have been scheduled for December 3.","I have appointed Dennis Matheis, an experienced operator with career experience at both organizations, to lead our integration planning. And we have developed a detailed and comprehensive approach to bringing together the strengths of our two companies. Together with leadership contributions from both Anthem and CIGNA, our integration planning teams will ensure we capture the full potential of this transaction for our customers. We remain confident in our ability to close this transaction in the second half of 2016.","Turning to our full-year 2015 outlook, we continue to see 2015 as a year of continued growth across our business. We are updating our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook from a greater than $10 to a range of $10.10 to $10.20. Our revised outlook reflects the strong performance of the first nine months of the year as well as an expectation for meaningfully lower fourth quarter margins in both business segments.","We had previously indicated that the third quarter would represent about 60% of our second half adjusted earnings and our core results for third quarter came in modestly above that level. Beyond the core outperformance, the third quarter did benefit from favorable timing related to Medicaid retro rate reimbursements and G&A expenditures. This had the effect of shifting some of the projected earnings from the fourth quarter into the third quarter.","Consistent with our prior discussions with you, our outlook expects the Commercial business to generate meaningfully lower margins in the fourth quarter of this year, leading to a full year 2015 margin in the high-single digits by year-end. Our fourth quarter margin forecast reflects the calendar impact of deductible leverage and continued lower than expected contributions from the Individual business. We also expect our Government business margins will compress in the fourth quarter from the third quarter levels, partially reflecting the timing of retro rate adjustments that occurred in the third quarter, which were expected in the fourth quarter as well as normal seasonal patterns and the ramp-up in spending to prepare for the launch of the Iowa business and the annual enrollment period for Medicare.","Similar to our discussion one year ago, we also want to highlight a potential timing issue related to the revenue recognition of certain Medicaid contract rate changes in certain markets which could be approximately $50 million.","Our 2015 adjusted EPS outlook has previously and continues to assume the revenue will be recognized by year-end 2015. To be clear, this is simply a timing issue as to whether this amount is able to be booked as revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 or the first quarter of 2016. In summary, we are now two years into our five-year targeted growth strategy we shared at our last IR day. And aside from Individual, the remainder of our business has performed well versus expectations during this period. We remain focused on executing against our strategic growth initiatives and are currently in the midst of our annual planning process, including a review of our anticipated headwinds and tailwinds into 2016.","I will now turn the call over to Wayne to discuss some key consolidated financial metrics from the third quarter of 2015. He will also provide some initial thoughts around our headwinds and tailwinds looking into 2016.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Joe, and good morning. I'd like to first discuss a few of our key balance sheet metrics. Consistent with our past practice, we've included a roll forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we experienced favorable prior-year reserve development of $818 million which was moderately better than our expectations. While the favorable development was higher than what was recognized in the first nine months of 2014, it resulted in offsetting adjustments for the risk stabilization programs from Health Care Reform.","We continue to maintain our upper-single digit margin for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of September 30, 2015. Our days in claims payable was 42.3 days as of September 30, down 0.7 days from the 43.0 days as of June 30, 2015. The expected decrease is primarily due to changes in the timing of claims payments between periods. As previously discussed, we expect days in claims payable to come back down closer to 40 days over time.","Our debt-to-capital ratio was 41.2% at September 30, 2015, down 70 basis points from 41.9% as of June 30, which reflects the impact of repaying approximately $625 million of long-term debt due in the quarter, consistent with our capital management strategies. We ended the third quarter with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and investments at the parent company and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $463 million as of September 30.","Moving to cash flow, we generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion during the first nine months of 2015 or 1.3 times net income with cash flow in the third quarter of $343 million. As a reminder, cash flow in the third quarter was impacted by the payment of the 2015 health insurer fee, partially offset by the receipt of the 2014 reinsurance reimbursement from the federal government. Cash flow trends thus far in 2015 continue to be encouraging and we remain comfortable on our outlook of greater than $3.5 billion for the full year.","Due to the impact of capital management strategies put into place prior to the announcement of our acquisition Cigna, we repurchased 0.7 million shares during the quarter for approximately $105 million, representing a weighted average price of $143.89. As of September 30, we had approximately $4.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, which is intended to utilized over a multi-year period subject to market conditions. As a reminder, we do not expect to repurchase shares for the remainder of 2015 following the recent agreement with Cigna. We used $163 million during the quarter for cash dividend and yesterday, the Audit Committee declared our fourth quarter 2015 dividend of $0.625 per share to shareholders.","Turning to 2016, we are currently working through our planning process and analyzing the impact of various expected headwinds and tailwinds into 2016. The tailwinds include continued enrollment growth across the Government, Commercial National accounts, and Large Group self-funded markets; the continued opportunity to expand margins in Medicare Advantage; and the benefit from capital deployment in 2016 albeit at a lower level than in recent years as we prepare for the Cigna transaction to close.","For headwinds, we expect 2016 will be another challenging year for Individual enrollment and margins as result of the continued competitive pressures in various markets and the associated negative operating leverage of that pressure. We remain confident in our strategy and market position, but unsustainable pricing by some of the market participants is persisting longer than we had expected and the overall market growth is lagging expectations.","There are potential Medicaid margin pressure reflecting startup losses from large new contract awards as well as an initial view that recent outperformance in certain markets may not repeat in 2016 with a more challenging rate environment. And finally, we plan to make certain technology investments to advance our efforts to improve the cost of care, enhance our provider collaboration initiatives, and improve the consumer engagement. Taken together, these items represent a challenge to our targeted growth strategy in the near-term. As part of our planning process, we are focused on identifying steps to mitigate the impact of these headwinds to our earnings outlook in 2016. We expect to provide more details around our 2016 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call in January, as usual.","With that, operator, please open the queue for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. Due to the limited time and in fairness to other listeners, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up per turn. Your first question comes from of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hello, everybody. Thanks for the question. Just maybe to drill down on the comments around the Individual business and the higher MLR you're seeing there, is that primarily on the public exchanges or is it off-exchange as well? And how much of it relates to just lower prior period development than what you saw a year ago in the segment?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, A.J., and thanks for the question. Let me first just discuss what I see as a competitive but very rational pricing backdrop outside of Individuals. I want to make sure that the market understands what we're seeing outside of the Individual market, and that cost trend is tracking well with a bias towards the lower half of our stated range. So when you think about what we're highlighting here, we really want to make sure we focus on the Individual book both on-exchange and off-exchange.","To give you a little bit more background here, we do continue to believe that our strategy is the right long-term strategy, and our profitable growth over the past two years \u2013 that's not just last year, we continued to have profitable growth this year. But the market is, however, very dynamic, and we continue to see lower overall enrollment growth on a national basis. And as you know, that creates a deleverage of G&A, which does impact our margins. And there continues to be pockets of industry pricing that we just don't believe is sustainable. And we are going to need to be patient until this works itself out, which we hope will be by 2017 and 2018. So due to these dynamics, our position right now is what we thought would be a tailwind going into 2016 is probably going to be a headwind at this point, but as Joe mentioned, we're work through mitigation strategies right now around G&A.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And if I just might follow up on that, obviously, we've had the announcements of a number of co-ops that are closing and some of those are in big states. So in terms of looking ahead in 2016 and headwinds, tailwinds, how do you think about that impacting your thinking \u2013 I mean it seems like given your share position in those markets that you might be a primary beneficiary of some of those exits, and that may ease some of the pressure. Any thoughts?","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. A.J., good morning. This is Joe. Good question. First of all, just to put a number to it, as of last night, there are 10 co-ops that have initiated closure. And as you well know, our pricing for 2016 products are already baked and in market. So, obviously, we are observing the effect closures will have in 2016 in terms of market movement, i.e., membership from plan to plan.","Our sense is that, to Wayne's point, the rationality that we've been expecting certainly will begin to take root into 2017 with pricing relative to product going out to market in 2016. In that regard, I think it's kind of got a so-called, a longer gestation period than moving from one year in 2015 to the next in 2016. So we're extremely prudent. We've said this repeatedly, that we will not chase price to buy membership and we've been adamant about that. We've been very clear with respect to our expectation that, to the degree that there is irrationality in pricing, product design, et cetera, that we will ultimately see a stabilization.","So again, our sense is that it's more of a multi-year outlook, A.J., and that 2016 will probably give us some key indicators, but it's not going to be so-called the final solution in the states where we reside with these products and pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Tom A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. A follow-up question on the Medicaid retro rate true-ups that you commented on. If you exclude those payments for this quarter, would Government margins be up, flat, or down from the third quarter of last year?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Tom. First of all, our Medicaid margins are actually still \u2013 we're performing quite well on the Medicaid side of the shop in many of our markets, and overall I'm really pleased, quite honestly, with the execution of the team across not only existing markets but new markets. I do want to emphasize though that, while we're not quantifying what the favorable timing was on either that or the G&A that got deferred to Q4, I can say that the core of our performance excluding those items, is reflected in our updated outlook.","Tom A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So I think, on second quarter, you said that you expected Government margins to come down a bit for the second half of the year. Has that changed a bit in your mind?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think fourth quarter will be a heavy period in which it comes down. It's important to recognize that we get a lot of our new rates at least first pass as we look into next year begin to come to us in the September, October timeframe. So we're getting a better view now into the rating environments as we move into next year, and some of that will start to impact fourth quarter.","Tom A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Just wanted to come back to the Individual issues, and it's sort of more of a qualitative question. You guys talk about seeing unsustainable pricing from certain competitors, but clearly it's persisted for at least three years. So when you guys say unsustainable, is there anything structurally that might give some non-profits the ability to sustain what you guys believe is somewhat irrational for a longer period of time like a tax issue or something? Or is it just \u2013 I guess, I'm just looking for some better understanding for why you believe it's unsustainable, but yet it's been able to persist for so long. Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Chris. Appreciate the question. I think one thing to keep in mind though is that the 3Rs were put in place and essentially created sustainability. And as those are making their way out of the system and as you know, two of the 3Rs would dissipate by next year for lack of a better phrase, the training wheels come off, and the business is going to have to be self-sustaining at that point. We're obviously all aware that on the risk-corridors that the government is now indicated that we'll only be paying $0.12 on the dollar regarding the corridors at this point in time.","And so we think these dynamics have to work their way through the system. And as that happens \u2013 and we think evidence is starting to come through. As Joe said, we've seen 10 co-ops now indicated they will no longer be in business beginning next year. So we have to see this work itself through the system, but we believe that going into 2017, the 3Rs will have substantially worked their-selves through and we think the backdrop will change.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up here. When you guys talk about higher favorable PPD last year, was that only in the Individual business? Or is that a general comment on the Commercial side? Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Chris. It is heavily weighted to the Individual business, but in general, all of Commercial had favorable PPD. The point we want to emphasize, though, is last year versus this year, is you really need to look at a nine month versus nine month, versus a quarter versus a quarter. There was so much uncertainty in the first six months of last year that we maintained very solid reserves. And then as we got better certainty, we began to bring this down intra-year in the third quarter and fourth quarter. We now have, what I would call, much more stable MLR outlook now that we've got a second year under our belts. So it's more about timing between quarters than it is comparing year-over-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Wayne, just want to follow up on the comments that you made. I understand you will be giving guidance later for 2016, but it sounded like \u2013 I just want to make sure I get this right that the headwinds \u2013 you sort of emphasized headwinds \u2013 I'm sorry, tailwinds \u2013 headwinds, I'm sorry, instead of tailwinds. Last year, at this time, you spoke about a comfort for guidance \u2013 for consensus. It's $11.17 for next year. So I was wondering, if you can put your comments in the context of where the consensus is?","And then, I know I am cheating a little bit with the second question, but even within that, I'm still struggling with the sustainability of your Government margins. You're running at 6.1%, and still over 5.2% year-to-date, and you're talking about margin opportunity on Medicare which would imply Medicaid north of that, so I'm just trying to figure out what you guys think a sustainable Government margin is and maybe how that plays into 2016 relative to where the Street is thinking?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Josh. A number of questions there, so let me first hit your first one about more growth going into next year. Let me start by saying, since Joe joined this company, he's laid out a growth agenda and we remain committed to capitalizing on those opportunities across all of our businesses. So the short answer is it is our intention to grow adjusted EPS in 2016, but we did highlight some headwinds that we're working on and hopefully will mitigate. And we believe we have opportunities to mitigate.","Those headwinds, though, really fall into two primary buckets. One is what we just highlighted on the Individual, and the second one is, Josh, what you've indicated, which is the Medicaid margins in certain markets are running higher than what we would have as a long-term sustainable margin and we think it's prudent, at least at this point, to maintain an outlook that those margins will get compressed in some of our markets going into 2016.","And the other thing I would simply highlight is we still have opportunity though for margin expansion in MA, although it's improved quite a bit this year, we're pleased with that and we expect growth next year. And we have many new markets that we are still expanding it on Medicaid though that are not at our optimal margin levels, so \u2013 but I think you have to expect in those markets that are above our high-end margins that those are going to contract next year and that's what we're going to plan for.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And within the context of the consensus, sort of, how you made comments last year?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, at this point, I don't want to give guidance relative to the consensus, but we are comfortable in saying that we have a growth agenda, and as we build out our plans over the next 90 days to mitigate some of these headwinds we'll give more guidance in January.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. I wanted to focus on Commercial margin. I caught \u2013 Joe, I joined a little late, but I caught you saying that kind of reiterating the target for high-single digits for the year. It looks to me if fourth quarter stacks up like third quarter, that would basically get you there. But I also thought I understood you to say that margins would drop a little bit sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter. So I just want to make sure I understand, however you might add some color there, either more precision around what high-single digits means or what the sequential progression would be from third quarter to fourth quarter? Thank you.","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thank you for the question. Let me just underscore that, consistent with our prior discussions, we continue to expect Commercial business to generate meaningful lower margins in the fourth quarter. And then, of course, leading to full year 2015 margins, we're obviously stating that we believe it will be in the high-single digit by year-end. Our fourth quarter margin forecast does reflect calendar year impact of deductible leverage and continued lower than expected contributions from the Individual business. I think we kind of covered all those nuances or aspects in the commentary. I'm hopeful that, kind of, is responsive to your question.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","And just to put maybe a finer point on that, those are \u2013 you expect those to be incremental additional pressures from the third quarter, which has already dropped 300 basis points or so?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Dave, this is Wayne. Yeah, absolutely. Again, I want to emphasize, though, you really should be cautious on using Q3 of this year versus Q3 of last year because of how we built up reserves on the Individual book and how we release those intra-year last year versus this year, you have a much more of what I would call seasonality alignment of that reserve development and buildup. This is nothing new that we've discussed in the past.","So I think what you have to look at is margins are going to be more similar to what you saw in Q3, more in that 5%, 6% range going into Q4, but you'll still blend to an all-in margin. In fact, if you look at, on a year-to-date basis, our Commercial margins are actually up 70 basis points over where they were at a year from last year, and we expect those to migrate closer to that level.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks. I want to ask about the Medicare Advantage book. You guys \u2013 if I interpret your comments correctly, you're basically saying that 2016 is probably not going to be a year of membership growth, but that will probably be the last year some of the changes you need to make. So we should think about 2016 as about little membership growth but significant margin improvement, is that the way to think about that?","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think we're building success year-over-year, and to your point, going into 2016, we are continuing to, call it, refine our served markets, really focusing on the opportunistic aspects of being engaged in those markets, calibrating our presence in a way that we can continue to grow margin and ultimately grow little more membership as a springboard opportunity. We're certainly optimistic that we're getting closer to that so-called positive growth inflection that we keep referencing and that we are truly expecting continued growth in those core geographies that we have served, and we're going to probably still experience some offset by further market exits and 2016.","So it's still, call it, a dynamic equation that we're managing, but a productive kind of a movement nonetheless. We know that we've got to be focused on managing the total cost of care in MA. And that's been our sort of shoulder to the wheel over the last couple of years. We're seeing really a marked improvement in our profitability in that space, and as we then move forward into 2016 in terms of capturing that so-called inflection point, we're going to be offering competitive products and we'll continue to make those necessary investments to improve not only the capabilities but the execution to capture the growth objectives that we've established for ourselves.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then you made a comment that you're pleased with the progress on Stars, but you're still lagging the peers on the Stars. One of your competitors talked about their investments in Stars creating a drag in the near-term. I mean, how do you think about the ability to move margins up while still having to make some improvement on the Star Ratings going forward?","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well, we did achieve improvement in Stars, and according to plan. And we've always had an outlook in terms of a target for 2015 going into 2016 and 2017, and we did meet those targets in terms of our internal expectations. We made progress throughout 2015, we have substantially increased the percentage of membership and with respect to provider collaboration agreements that we believe represents kind of the bedrock of how we're going to improve our Stars performance, and we're continuing to work toward our short-term goal. I think this is important enough to recognize our short-term target being having 50% of our membership in four-star plans, which is for the 2018 payment year.","So all in, we're very pleased with sort of a migration path that we put ourselves on. Margins are expected to continue to expand in line with our long-term growth objectives in this space. So all in, again, I think we have some very strong outlook for this space, and we think we're progressing quite nicely with respect to meeting our objectives.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks.","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't know, Wayne, do you want to add something?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Kevin, one thing I want to highlight, though, for our investors is this. I've been with this organization for 10 years and my optimism around the turnaround strategy that started two years ago has never been higher. We have seen the margin improvement, we've now consolidated to a single platform. We believe even the markets that we're in the last phase of exiting, we believe we'll be able to cover those markets with growth and all the other markets that we're now participating in.","And so while there's a lot of kind of sausage making here and you can't see all the details, I can tell you that the optimism is quite high. In fact, we expect that MA will have a solid growth going into next year within that core line of business on top the growth we had this year. And our original target was that we would have north of 25% of our membership and four-star rated plans this year. We were realistic about how fast we thought we could move the needle, and the team achieved that goal. And we expect to raise that to more than 50% by the following year. So we've laid out a plan. It was a thoughtful plan, and we're really executing well against it.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, there. I'm trying to understand what's going on in the public exchange Individual business. Was there a meaningful or even \u2013 was there a deterioration in the profitability of that book of business second quarter to third quarter that was beyond what you anticipated? And are you sure you captured any issues there in your pricing? I know you exited Wisconsin. Are there other markets on the block?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Christine. No, nothing was unexpected versus what we had anticipated. I think the MLRs are little again misleading because of the excess reserves we put up last year in the first half and started taking down in the second half, but Individual is performing as we expected. We continue to be profitable in that book of business versus our outlook. But as we look into next year, we just see an environment, a backdrop where we now have the benefit of seeing what competitive pricing is and we know where our pricing is at, and ultimately, it's a top line issue that we're not going to get the volume that we would have expected in light of the price point but we believe our price point is still right and we believe pricing below that has profitability concerns.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then can you talk about the $50 million...","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sorry. Christine, I just want to correct something that you said, which it's very easy to go there and that is you commented that we've exited Wisconsin. We've not exited Wisconsin, we've exited some counties in Wisconsin and then we've adjusted our presence in certain other counties in terms of the number of available exchanges in 34 other Wisconsin counties. I just want to calibrate kind of perspective that, again, as we should, we are adjusting and adapting based on the realities of the marketplace in terms of how we think we can best perform in those states.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then the Medicaid rate changes could be worth $50 million. Is that a this year event? Is that a next year event? Is that in guidance? I assume that's Medicaid rate cut. But I just I'm not sure when to think about that.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Our current guidance is that we have $50 million that we assume we will be getting from a particular state. As you know, the way we recognize revenue is very dependent upon the contract and when that's actually signed. And so ultimately, we still fully expect to get it completed within the quarter along with feedback from the state. This is not a concern about revenue we believe we're entitled to for the current year. It's just a question of will it end up still being in Q4 or does it get pushed to January of Q1 of next year. Right now, we still anticipate it'll be this year and it's in our guidance.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right. And this is a good guide?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. So maybe just talking a little bit more on cost trend there, any additional color? I mean, you clearly stated the bias remains to lower half. Were there any changes throughout the year or quarter worth highlighting? And then also, have you thought about cost trend through your entire book like including Individual, et cetera, which I know is not how you report it? Would cost trends still be below what you price to? Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Andy. So, yeah, cost trend continues to be within our original guidance range and we still believe based on our nine months as well as our projections for the fourth quarter, that will be in the lower half of that guidance range. You are correct, while we don't give cost trend by line of business, I would say businesses are generally still playing within our pricing expectations. In fact, if you were to look more broadly, some businesses performing even better, which is why we have some outperformance in certain markets out there around Medicaid and a few other lines. So again, the broader backdrop is, cost trend is playing fine in really all lines of business. The Individual issue is about volume, it's not about trend.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then just real quick...","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, let me just underscore, just \u2013 I think it's important to note kind of some of the tactical initiatives we have at our disposal. We are accelerating the benefit that it can bring to us, such as a lot of innovative tools in and around provider collaboration, data analytics, so one of our key pillars as an enterprise is really heavily focused on better managing the total cost of care. So I think in combination with market as well as what we're capable of administering in terms of the necessary tactics, I think we've got a kind of a nice kind of combination of efforts, and realities in the market that allow us to better manage the cost trend that you're citing.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. First on the exchanges, is the drop off just related to sort of either losing market share, not gaining as much versus individuals not paying premiums, I guess, at this point? And then if that is having an impact on MLR in terms of not paying sort of premiums seemingly these individuals utilized before dropping \u2013 so are you on the hook for that bill and is that, anything driving that down as well?","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, let me just jump in real quick, kind of a, more of a higher level commentary. And Wayne can jump in, in terms of some of the technical details, but specifically, volume shortfall got to be put into context, because our 2015 plan was created using the most recent CBO estimates for 2015 exchange marketplace, which at the time was 15 million enrollees nationally.","And so the new kind of, I guess, call it, perspective or estimate from CMS, which updates the marketplace size, is going to be somewhere between 9 million and 9.9 million in 2015. So putting all that in perspective, if you look at our circumstance with respect to Individual, we've witnessed an exchange enrollment shift of about 30% downward migration, and related to initial expectations for this time of year, which we believe reflects the lower-than-expected overall market growth as well as market share losses due to so-called unsustainable pricing by some of our competitors. So that's kind of maybe the big story. I don't know, Wayne, do you want to get into the, maybe, the detail as to \u2013 that would be great.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","To Joe's comment, Ralph, let me just be clear. It's not a non-payment issue.","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's not the issue. We're collecting our revenue. The governments paying the portion of those that are subsidized. There's no concerns at all. It's purely a volume issue. When you have fewer national enrollees and you have price points that we don't believe are sustainable, we've just made a conscious decision we're not going to chase it. And so, if you think about it, we're down on Individual in the quarter 99,000 lives and that process we don't see slowing down in the Q4. And so, we're trending in, what I'll call, the wrong direction on enrollment, but we believe the right answer then is to be patient and see this through versus racing to the bottom. And again, we think, as the 3Rs dissipate, you'll start to see that market harden.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess given the lower exchange ramp, I mean, are you still comfortable or do you see that as sort of a headwind to getting to that $14 earnings target that you had put out there for 2018?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ralph, really appreciate this question, because this is an important commentary. I want to make sure our shareholders understand. With the exception of the Individual book we're speaking to, our other businesses combined are exceeding our expectations through the first two years and are on-target for our 2018 goals. So if the Individual environment hardens like we anticipate it will, hopefully beginning in 2017 and 2018, then that $14 still remains intact. If the environment remains where it's at today, that will put some pressure on that, although at this point, we do have other lines that are ahead of where we thought they would be at, at this point in time, and hopefully that trend will continue. So, a ways to go, but right now, if the environment stays the way it is on Individual, that would definitely create a headwind to the 2014 outlook.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow up again on the exchange question. What I'm hearing you say is, it's market share losses to other plans. Firstly, does that happen throughout the year? And then secondly, as you are looking at the hospital story, which is showing a pretty marked increase in uncompensated care and they're talking about attrition, any thoughts on what that is about and what subsidy levels that is coming at?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Ana. Again, relative to the exchanges, we're expecting continue to have market share losses in the fourth quarter and then expect that will continue on Individual going into next year because of the unsustainable pricing. It's an interesting dynamic. I can't really comment on the hospital industry and what they're seeing. I can comment as we've said before, though, that on a broader trend basis, overall trend is playing quite well. So it would seem to imply at least some of our dynamics are impacting them regarding trend, but again I really can't speak to any specifics regarding their issues or concerns. But I do think people are going to have to be patient on this exchange business, and be willing to not participate aggressively until the environment gets better.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","So that, again, on Individual again, we talked about sort of attrition which is \u2013 or market share losses, which is a headwind, obviously, profitability and you have been one of the leaders on the diversified side of the house. It seems like your peers are not doing great, but here you've got Centene and Molina and even Health Net, though they're a California story, doing quite well. You have Amerigroup and Commercial. Are they doing something more about the contracting that's different? Or are they stopping their enrollment at maybe 200% or 250% federal poverty level and that's just a different ballgame in terms of profit? How does that play out for you as an Individual player in the long-term?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Ana, I really appreciate the question. Again, first, let me emphasize that we are still making money in our Individual book and making margins that we think are sustainable margins. So I think it's really important to recognize that we are an outlier, but I think we are an outlier in that we are one of the few lines that is doing quite well. Again, I can't speak specifically to Centene or Molina or others regarding their strategies and what they're doing, but there is a way to go after this market and be profitable and we are doing that. But we participate in different markets as well than they do in some cases. And so when you've seen one market, you've seen one market. Based on what we've seen for pricing next year, though, we believe at this point in time we will not be growing market share. In fact, we believe market share for us will deteriorate next year.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. I wonder if you might just comment briefly on what you think the impact that the PACE legislation has on your outlook for Small Group, and then maybe just talk about that outlook a little bit. I know previously you anticipated some of the Small Group pressures would be not completely gone but certainly diminishing as you moved into 2016. It seems like PACE would have helped that a little bit and it also sounds like the majority of the concern or the headwind, if you will, is really more around the Individual group business versus Small Group and I just want to make sure that's correct.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Gary. I would say, broadly speaking, I think your assumptions are reasonable. We're seeing the pace of Small Group actually slow down quite a bit in terms of the attrition. As you know, earlier this month, the President did sign in the legislation, repealing the federally mandated Small Group expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which sort of changed the definition to include employers of 1 to 100 employees. So from our perspective, we think that was a positive relative to the Small Group and what we'll see, but generally, we've classified as likely to expand in our Small Group markets, into certain markets next year. We see actually a market share growth opportunity for us, but nonetheless, we want to take a cautious outlook until we see how the markets play out next year.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Go ahead. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Maybe I could ask a question on the group business and the trends you see going into next year. So you think you may get some market share gain on the Small Group side in 2016. So I would infer from that that the aggressive pricing in Individual is not as much an issue there or not an issue there. What about in the middle market and National Accounts in terms of enrollment trends that are shaping up for January on the risk and on the ASO side?","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Matt. Good morning. First of all, we're obviously not in a position yet to give guidance regarding how we're seeing certain markets play. As you know in the middle market, fourth quarter is a big re-enrollment period. So we're in the midst of re-enrollment just starting. So we'll know more as that evolves. But we do have re-enrollment occurring or new wins are in National Accounts, we know that season is now behind us and that is moving forward. So we're very pleased with our results regarding National Accounts, and we expect to be a meaningful market share taker going into next year. We'll provide more details in January, but it will be in the hundreds of thousands of range, again, it's in that taker for National Accounts.","Again, I do want to clarify though we're in a very dynamic market. So we're maintaining a level of margins on Small Group we want to maintain. We think our pricing is rational. We think there's pockets where we could potentially not only stabilize but potentially grow in Small Group but we want to continue to see how the broader markets play out. But right now, with the exception of Individual, we think it's a very rational pricing for a competitive market.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Brian Wright from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple real quick. The $50 million Medicaid, I'm just assuming that's California, they seem to have been kind of \u2013 continue to be late on the full ACA gross-up. Is that right?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, Brian, we don't call out specific states, but I would tell you the $50 million is not a concern regarding collectability or revenue recognition. It's just a timing issue.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. And then \u2013 and I apologize, could you help us out with just, kind of, the magnitude of the retro stuff in the third quarter to the fourth quarter, just to help us with the magnitude on the Government segment for modeling that?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think again, Brian, as we said, we're not going to break out quarters. We don't give quarterly guidance but I would tell you though that excluding that item and the G&A timing, the outperformance that we've reflected in our new outlook is what the outperformance was in the quarter and so it's in the $0.10 to $0.20 range you can see.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Great. Thank you. And (53:16) tailwinds and the commentary about the exchanges versus a Small Group. It seems to me, when I put that all together, you have projections out there in the S-4. It doesn't seem like things are materially different than that.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think at this point, we're still in the midst of building out our plan. And as Joe said, we have a growth agenda. And we just wanted to make sure that our shareholders understood the headwinds that we think are real and we continue to work through mitigation strategies and we'll provide more details in January.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the conference back to the company's management for closing comments.","Joseph R. Swedish - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great. Thank you very much. Thanks for the questions and maybe building on the last question with respect to our modeling for 2016, let me say that, first, we're very pleased with the performance thus far in 2015 as reflected in our updated adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year to a range of $10.10 to $10.20.","Looking ahead to 2016 now, I want to reiterate that we're focused on our long-term strategic targets and are working to identify the steps we need to take to mitigate the headwinds we've discussed this morning. There are certain key growth drivers over the next several years that I want to highlight before we leave, and that will include continued strong Government enrollment growth, National Account growth, volume and margin improvement in the Individual business, continued Large Group and Small Group execution, improvement in Medicare Advantage margins, and then operating efficiencies in capital deployment.","All in, I'm really proud of the execution of our team for 2015 and what's possible for 2016 given this dynamic environment that we are performing in. Finally, I want to thank all of our associates for their continued effort to help our members access quality affordable healthcare as our markets continue to evolve. Their contribution has been critical to our success and formed the foundation of our ability to deliver our strategic goals.

It's important to note that our results include roughly $.04 of assessments associated with the State of Colorado dissolution of their co-op, an expense that was not expected when we last stated our full-year earnings outlook.","I am very pleased with our 2015 performance. And I believe the growing diversification of our company and the complementary nature of our pending Cigna acquisition will position us well to capitalize on marketing opportunities over the next several years. We remain focused on improving healthcare affordability, quality and choice to our growing membership base.","I am going to start with some overview comments on our fourth quarter and 2015 results and then move to discuss our 2016 outlook in more detail. Fourth quarter results capped a successful 2015 with underlying fundamentals that tracked well versus our expectations. The fourth quarter represented the lowest quarterly adjusted earnings per share during 2015 which reflected our evolving business mix and the timing of medical utilization and operating expenses. As expected, this included lower margins in our commercial and government businesses due to a higher benefit expense ratio and an increase in investment spending.","Both fully insured and self-funded membership tracked ahead of expectations and we ended the year with 36.6 million members, a growth of 1.1 million lives or nearly 3% since 2014. Our fourth quarter performance creates a favorable starting point for 2016 enrollment. In particular, during the quarter we saw better than expected membership growth in our large group and Medicaid markets. As expected we ended the year with 791,000 individual public exchange lives, a decrease of 33,000 from the third quarter.","During 2015, we added a total of 84,000 lives in public exchanges. Our small-group enrollment declined by just north of 100,000 lives in the quarter to 1.2 million lives as we saw higher than expected lapses in plans that had previously earlier renewed with a December 1 benefit start date.","During the quarter, medical cost trends continues to came in favorably versus our stated range.","Our 2015 medical cost trend came in at the lower half of our previously guided range of 6.5% to 7.5%. For 2016, we anticipate lower-group medical cost trends will be slightly higher in the range of 7% to 7.5%.","Operating revenue was $78.4 billion during 2015, an increase of $5.4 billion or 7.4% versus 2014, reflecting strong enrollment growth in the government business. Additional premium revenue to cover over-all cost trends and increased fees associated with healthcare reform.","Also contributing was the growth in administrative fee revenue as a result of our strong self-funded membership trends. This was partially offset by fully insured membership losses in our commercial business. The full year 2015 benefit expense ratio was 83.3%, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior year. The year-over-year increase reflected the change in our business mix towards the government business division and a higher benefit expense ratio in the individual exchange business.","Our SG&A expense ratio came in at 16% for the full year 2015, a decrease of 10 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by the changing mix of our membership to the government business and a continued focus on administrative expense control, reflecting the need to insure that we have the right cost structure for our public exchange membership outlook throughout 2016.","Supporting the strong quality of our earnings during 2015, we reported operating cash flow approximately $4.1 billion or 1.6 times net income with cash flow in the fourth quarter of $949 million.","While we're pleased with our run rate cash flow performance, our 2015 results included the benefit of approximately $500 million in timing items related to government and vendor payments. These items are simply timing and accelerated our 2015 cash flow which we originally expected to be in 2016. Including the impact of these timing items, we expect 2016 operating cash flow to be greater than $3 billion.","Commercial operating margins in 2015 were 7.6% reflecting year-over-year improvements in all lines of business with the exception of individual. As we have previously discussed, operating results on the public exchanges have lagged expectations during the year as membership was more than 30% behind our original expectations.","As expected commercial fourth quarter margins represented the lowest of the year reflecting the timing of benefits, expense and our evolving mix of business. Our government business continued its strong year into the fourth quarter with an ending margin of 4.8%, an improvement of 130 basis points versus 2014 along with better than expected membership results. In particular, our Medicare and Medicaid margins improved meaningfully versus 2014.","We're very encouraged by the turnaround plan put in place by our Medicare team, now finishing the second year of a three year plan. Their recent performance is an encouraging next step towards driving meaningful long-term earnings growth. We expect margins will continue to improve in 2016 towards our expected long-term sustainable level, and we have positioned our portfolio to grow enrollment in the right markets with the right products in 2017.","For Medicaid, our team has built a process that is focused on the basic blocking and tackling aspects of managing our members' total cost of care and quality. We're leveraging our assets to provide industry-leading solutions to our government partners to help control their population's healthcare costs without sacrificing the quality of care.","While this year's margin performance is above our long-term expectations, we feel confident in our team's ability to continue to outperform on a wide variety of care management and performance metrics. Regarding our balance sheet metrics, we have included a role forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. For the full year, 2015, we experienced favorable prior-year reserve development of $800 million which was moderately better than our expectations.","While the favorable development was higher than what was recognized during 2014, it resulted in offsetting adjustments for the risk stabilization programs from healthcare reform. We continue to maintain our upward single-digit margin for adverse deviation and believe our reserve balance remains consistent and strong as of December 31st, 2015.","For the 3Rs related to the 2015 benefit year, we continue to book reinsurance as appropriate and continue to expect to be in a net payable position for risk corridors. We continue to record a valuation allowance against the risk corridor receivables in certain markets as we do not believe those receivables will ultimately be collected. We believe our estimates are prudent given the dynamic nature of available information.","Our days in claims payable was 42.7 days as of December 31, an increase of 0.4 days from the 42.3 days as of September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to changes in the timing of claims payments between periods. As previously discussed, we do still expect days and claims payable to come back down closer to 40 days over time.","Our debt-to-capital ratio was 40.8% at December 31, 2015, down 40 basis points from 41.2% as of September 30, which reflects the impact of reducing our outstanding balance in commercial paper during the quarter.","We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and investments at the parent company and our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of approximately $368 million as of December 31.","Turning to our 2016 outlook, we currently expect operating revenues to grow to a range of $80 billion to $81 billion which is light of the long-term projections we laid out at our Investor Day in early 2014. The shortfall was primarily due to our individual exchange membership being meaningfully behind our projections, as we've discussed with you previously.","In commercial, we expect relatively steady enrollment during the year. We expect growth of over 300,000 lives for National Accounts in 2016 with strong momentum in securing new contract wins and exceeding our retention expectations. We also expect growth in large group self-funded enrollment reflecting new contract wins.","While we expect strong growth in ASO, our commercial-fully-insured growth will be pressured. We expect membership declines of approximately 300,000 in our individual business, as we aren't experiencing the overall market growth on the public exchange that we projected when we laid our five-year plan and unsustainable pricing in some markets is hurting our historic market share.","We are encouraged that early indicators of the open enrollment activity are slightly better than our muted expectations. Recent actions taken by CMS to begin addressing the special enrollment period challenges as well as the elimination of the health insurer fee in 2017 are important first steps towards improving affordability for our customers. And you can be assured; we are contributing to the dialog to form a long-term, sustainable and affordable marketplace.","We also expect Local Group fully-insured membership losses of approximately 250,000 as members continue to transition into self-funded product offerings. It is important to note that while this trend is in line with recent history, we now do not expect a meaningful offset to this trend from growth on the private exchanges.","Additionally, we expect continued pressure from the impact of higher levels of attrition due to the ending of insurance policies that were early-renewed by our clients before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. For Government, we expect another strong enrolment growth year. We expect Medicaid to add more than 350,000 lives reflecting the addition of new business in the state of Iowa as well as continued organic growth in core and expansion products. We continue to see states gravitate towards managed care to be the solution for more complex populations and services and we expect to be front and center supporting these states' initiatives.","Within our Medicare business, we continue to expect enrollment to be relatively steady as growth in our existing markets will be mostly offset by membership losses as we finalize the repositioning of our book in certain markets as part of our turnaround plan.","Turning to financial metrics, we expect relatively stable margins in 2016. We currently expect an MLR midpoint of 83.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus 2015. This reflects the impact of a change in the mix of our business as we expect strong growth in Medicaid, a business with a higher MLR than the consolidated average. Relating to cost-trend expectations, again, we expect 2016 Local Group medical cost trends to be in the range of 7% to 7.5%.","We expect our SG&A ratio in 2016 to be 15.4% at the midpoint. This reflects the impact of a changing mix of our business. Strong growth in Medicaid and the impact of the administrative efficiency initiatives our management team is taking to work through the challenging public exchange environment.","Below the line, we expect investment income of approximately $650 million, and interest expense of approximately $630 million. Note that our interest expense projection does not include the costs we expect to incur related to the bridge loan financing we have in place for the pending Cigna acquisition.","We also currently expect our tax rate to be in the range of 43.5% to 45.5% for the year. We expect some benefit from the impact of capital deployment activities next year. While we suspended share repurchases after the announcement of the Cigna acquisition in 2015, we plan to resume our capital deployment program in 2016 subject to market conditions, albeit at a lower level than in recent years. As a result, we currently expect our share count for the year to be in the range of 266 million to 270 million shares. We remain committed to at least maintaining our current dividend. We plan to review our capital deployment strategies at our next board meeting in February, and we expect to make an announcement on our first quarter 2016 dividend shortly thereafter.","To conclude, our 2016 GAAP earnings per share estimate is greater than $10.35. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is greater than $10.80. The difference between these two estimates is the exclusion of the amortization of deal related intangibles.","It's important to note that our 2016 outlook does not include any benefits or transaction costs associated with the pending acquisition of Cigna, which we continue to expect will close in the second half of the year.","With that, operator. Please open the queue for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hello. Thanks, everyone. I noticed on your guidance, you are forecasting your medical cost trend to a range of 50 basis points. Traditionally, you guys have always used 100 basis points in forecasting that. I'm just curious on your thinking of narrowing that. Obviously, the step-up sort of seemed similar to what you assumed last year and you came in at the low end. I'm just curious of the thinking behind that?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, A.J.; good morning, Essentially the thinking was that as of the last several years, I think it's fair to say there's been a lot of volatility regarding the exchanges, the Affordable Care Act, a number of new specialty drugs coming in. From our perspective, we generally have a point of view that's within 50 basis points. We've been hanging in pretty tight to that. And so it was more just to make sure that you understood that in fact we were raising our trend assumptions and our pricing going into this year. And have tried to tighten that band within a 50 basis point range. As we are getting better clarity now on the underlying activity associated with our commercial book as well as the new drugs that are coming in.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just to follow up on the \u2013 I know at a conference earlier in the month, you guys had made some comments about where you were at with your PBM, and I don't assume there is no assumptions and anything in the guidance related to this to any kind of changes in that contract, but is there any update on what you are thinking there, and what the opportunity might be?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","AJ, good morning, this is Joe. Nothing has changed since our statements earlier this month at the conference. And nothing has been included in the materials regarding the PBM dialog that we've had thus far, so I guess more to come later. But nothing is embedded at the moment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question, I just want to ask about the CMS sanctions at Cigna? And just want to see how does that fit with your understanding? Sort of when did you guys find out about it? Did you know about this as part of the diligence? And does this change anything in terms of your outlook, your financial outlook for the combined entities?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thank you. It's Joe again. First let me clearly state, we have two separate companies and obviously activities of that nature within their company, we do not have line of sight of nor should we, I think. And we are kind of considering it as you would expect, but at the moment we really don't have enough line of sight to pass judgment on what effect it may have, if any for that matter. So we will be vigilant and I'm certain that as time marches on, we'll learn more. But quite frankly at this stage there's really nothing for us to say regarding what impact it may have regarding Cigna.","And with respect to the transaction itself, we are clearly and unwavering with respect to our commitment to the deal. This does not have an effect on the deal process. And obviously, as we learn more, we'll certainly feather it into our considerations. But at this stage we just do not believe it has a material effect on our transaction.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. That's what I was looking for. And then just on the Commercial business, the MLR, I think in the past you guys have been attributing the increase, at least last quarter, to the Individual business. Now you're adding local group into that sort of discussion for the MLR driver. So just trying to figure out what's driving that increase? Did the Individual business deteriorate more? Or is this now more of a small-group issue? And as we look about the overall margin for the commercial segment this quarter being just over breakeven, is it fair to assume you're losing money now? Obviously in Individual, but also on the Local Group side as well?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, Josh, let me clarify. There's normal seasonality that we see in all books of business as deductibles are met throughout the year, so I want to emphasize that relative to the group business, no concerns at all. The primary MLR drivers are mix in the quarter. And as we've been talking about, the public exchanges. So again, I don't want to create any alarms there. Trend finished at the low end, lower half of our range, as we said earlier and the metrics remained strong.","One thing I would like to highlight though for each of you on the call is that we tried to maintain a conservative posture on the 3Rs as well while maintaining our reserve balance sheet strength with our high-single digit margin for adverse deviation at year end. So when you look at our run-rate Individual business, we still made a very slight \u2013 I'll call it, closer to breakeven for the year. But keep in mind that's with us maintaining a very conservative position on the 3Rs as well.","And going into 2016, we are still assuming we will be profitable on our Individual and exchange business, albeit below our targeted 3% to 5% margins as we continue to see those markets hopefully begin to harden around pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. Just I guess, I understand the concept of the mix shift impacting the MLR and the SG&A ratios, but it looks like given that you're growing earnings faster than revenue, you're looking for actual margin expansion next year. Can you point is it one division that you would point to as seeing stronger margin improvement year-over-year?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Kevin, the primary thing I would highlight is a lot of the initiatives we took was to take the G&A deleveraging out across the organization, that if we weren't going to see the membership growth that we expected on the exchanges. And then more importantly, I think as Joe has said, he's committed to us driving towards the $14 in 2018, and so we've had a very aggressive G&A initiative which allows both margin maintenance as well as some expansion in all lines of business as that effort was an enterprise-wide effort.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So it's on the Commercial side that you would say is where more of the margin expansion would be?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I guess as far as that comment about the 2014 number, I guess last quarter you kind of said, hey, the individual membership is coming in below what we might have thought and over our long-term targets that could be a drag towards hitting that. Are you saying now that you've found some offsets that are still going to make you comfortable with getting $14 on a standalone basis before Express? Or is that still a risk in your view?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. Kevin, I would say that relative to the revenue line item, if the individual membership fully insured market doesn't ramp up over the next several years, I think that $100 billion in organic revenue will be at risk. But I think relative to the $14 of earnings per share, as we've been able to show in 2015 going into 2016, there are many levers that we can pull, and Joe has aggressively pushed the management team to pull those levers with a high degree of confidence, hopefully, in our ability to execute against them. And so I think at this point I would tell you, and I'll let Joe say it for himself, he's committed and this management team is committed to driving towards the $14, but we may get there different than we laid out two years ago.","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Wayne. I will just reiterate and emphasize, we recognize the $100 billion might be somewhat flexible in terms of where we may end up in 2018 on that metric. However, we're incredibly committed to the $14. We believe there are certainly a lot of variables in the equation that will map to what the ultimate revenue capture will be. But nonetheless, all parts and pieces are going to line up we believe very effectively for us to make that $14 commitment. And so, again, we've got all actions in place regarding matters like the G&A controls and a variety of other puts and takes on the management side that will get us to the $14 target.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Kevin, as we said previously too, the PBM and the rising interest rates both serve as hedges against the other risks that we see in the business and potential opportunities for upside as well. Kevin, one other item I would like to highlight, as you had asked about other businesses with margin in addition to G&A, the Medicare improvement, as Joe laid out, our efforts over the last two years have been quite substantial, and the results have been very promising. So we will see very nice margin improvement in Medicare going into 2016 as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, I had one question and one follow-up. Just in terms of your costs trend guidance for 2016, would you care to kind of go through components of that? So hospital, inpatient, outpatient, physician form? Even just qualitatively in terms of expectations would be helpful.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We won't break it down, necessarily, although I can tell you that you can typically expect very little change in the physician aspects of it. It's very much driven more towards the specialty pharma being one of the primary drivers. We are expecting an increase in utilization on inpatient. Whether or not that plays out will remain to be seen. But it's primarily utilization and then it's a unit cost on pharma that are the drivers.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just a clarification, on the reported operating gain for the commercial segment for 4Q, it's $57 million, that's 0.6% margin, is that figure normalized excluding the California franchise tax ruling? Or is there a pre-tax number that's weighing upon that reported operating income margin?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. The only item that is of a unique nature that would be in there from an operating gain perspective is our desire to maintain a strong balance sheet associated with the 3Rs. And that has a direct impact on that. I'd like to be optimistic and hope there'll be upside there, but it appears even in the last year our conservative nature on some of these 3Rs has proved to be prudent. And so we decided to take that same posture in the fourth quarter and strengthen even further some of the 3R assumptions. Based on the public data available, it would imply we're conservative. But at the same time that data would have implied that last year it ended up not being the case. We tried to strengthen even further, and of course that hits the commercial segment directly.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's primarily a risk adjustment number we'll see in the 10-K?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the risk adjustment as well as the position that we don't see value in the corridors and assume a 100% allowance, as well as on the reinsurance we have stuck with strictly what the law currently says we're entitled to, not what maybe excess funding may be in the pool. And so those are the three positions we have taken a conservative posture in.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. I may have missed this, I'm not sure if you gave it. Did you say where you ended the year in terms of exchange, enrollment and maybe what's embedded into expectations in terms of exchange enrollment for 2016? And then just expanding on that, maybe where you're at in terms of on versus off exchange for your individual book?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We ended the year just shy of 800,000 members on the exchange enrollment, around 791,000 which was below our planned expectations by about 30%. We now are looking at the book in a more fungible way, we're looking on exchange and off exchange now because it's becoming quite fungible between the two as grand-mothering is moving away. And so for next year, we have individual declining by another 300,000 lives all in going into 2016. At least, that's our assumption.","As Joe said in the prepared remarks, the early enrollment application is encouraging against that assumption, but it's very important that we wait and see how lapses actually occur because we will know who ultimately pays and doesn't pay. We won't know that answer until the end of this month. So, again, the applications to-date would imply that we may be conservative there, but until we see actual payments and disenrollment, it's hard to declare.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just on the ASL book, you continue to show nice growth there. Are you seeing and capturing existing ASO business? Are you may be seeing a continued shift from risk to ASO? Are you seeing more penetration downstream to mid or smaller employers? Just trying to get a sense of the dynamics at play?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a little bit of both. Clearly, on the National Accounts, those were a lot of new wins for us, obviously some very sizeable wins including the Bank of America account. So from that perspective, I would say a big chunk of the ASO is really new membership and new lives to us. When you look at the shift from fully insured to ASO, that shift continues. I wouldn't call it at an accelerated pace anymore, it seems to have slowed down. But nonetheless, it's still occurring. And so we are retaining a lot of that membership moving from fully insured to ASO. But as you know, on a revenue basis, that really dampens the revenue if you're not getting the offset through either the public exchanges, or for that matter, what we thought would have been a faster pace in the private exchanges, which we believe is a much more muted pace now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So on the premium number, Wayne, that you were just hitting on the guidance relative to expectations is, call it, $2.5 billion to $3 billion light. The ASO shift accounts for some of that, but maybe less than half. I'm wondering if you believe you're getting \u2013 if there is anything in mix that would be affecting yield? And are you getting full premium yield relative to the cost trend expectations you are expecting for 2016?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Dave, great question. Let me first highlight that this revenue shortfall is almost predominantly associated with the lack of growth on the public exchanges. I can't emphasize that point enough. And ultimately, that would be the one area I would say, while we're projecting profitability still in 2016, clearly at margins below what we think are the long-term margins for sustainable program and product. So that would be the one area I would point to relative to yield. We are still able to cover our cost-to-capital on them and be profitable. But we are looking forward to some of the structural changes that I know the administration is looking at to make these programs even more viable in the long term. But our revenue issue is really a fully insured public exchange issue at this point. The rest of the book-of-business is performing well versus our five-year expectations we've laid out.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. My follow-up would be a follow-up on the PBM. Would you guys be willing to comment on how the analysis bridged from the $500 million to $700 million that you talked about say mid to early second half of 2015, to the $3 billion you've now talked about in January of 2016?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Joe. Let me comment on that. Going back in time to 2015 at earnings day, we did land on the $500 million to $700 million as a proxy statement regarding what may be possible related to market-check analysis, et cetera. Then fast-forward to today. We've gone through a very deliberate analytical process. We've vectored toward an answer related to multiple checks in the marketplace, and that brought us to the $3 billion finding that we believe is very, very credible, and obviously, having made that statement, which we believe kind of recalibrates the number from that $500 million to $700 million to something that we believe is much more realistic.","So what we said back in 2015 is that we would update you in 2016 actually hoping to communicate, I'll just call it, a solution to you regarding our PBM inquiry regarding what we would have to do to reposition ourselves to get to the end of the contract in 2019. So having made the statement about the $3 billion, our market-check expectations, we believe we've set the table now for conversations in and around the possibility of recasting our pricing relationship with ESI. So all I can tell you at this stage is that dialog will continue, and we're hopeful that still in 2016, we will reach a resolution to this matter that we are engaged in with ESI.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey there. I'm looking at the MLR, and as of third quarter of 2015, you expected the full year to be 82.9%, plus or minus 30 basis points and you were above that range at 83.3% for the full year. So was individual entirely the shortfall on that loss ratio?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Christine. Good morning. Individual was substantially the shortfall, that's correct. And again, it's important to recognize that some of the balance sheet strengthening we've done would all flow through that as well, regarding not only the 3Rs, but maintaining that high single digit for adverse deviation. So I would point you almost solely to that. Medicaid enrollment was a little bit stronger in the quarter than we had anticipated as well. So that has a little bit of an MLR mix shift to it. But it's predominantly individual and then the strengthening we did on the 3Rs.","Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And first half of the year, we were looking at a 3% to 5% margin, second half of the year we're looking at breakeven, so we've completely erased that 3% to 5%. Yet the bids were due in May and June. So can you help me understand how \u2013 when you didn't know about this 3% to 5% erosion in profitability you're confident that this is going to improve next year? Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Christine, it's a really great question. And it's one of the reasons that \u2013 the issue we had though on our margins this year was the inability to deleverage G&A quick enough. So we were still assuming a 3% to 5% margin, but we were also assuming a 30% growth rate. As we started seeing that growth rate not only not occur, but beginning to see some attrition in the latter part of the year, we realized it was imperative to get the G&A out. And I can tell you that those initiatives have occurred, those actions around head count and other costs have already been taken out now, and we will get the run rate effect going into the year.","So from that perspective, we feel fairly confident. Again, I would emphasize the public data that we're getting regarding risk adjustors from Wakely, regarding how 3Rs settled up on reinsurance last year, et cetera would imply we are being conservative in that outlook. But we've chosen to take that posture in 2015, and that's part of the reason of getting close to breakeven.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. The question firstly is around the catcher's-mitt strategy that you had articulated. Now we are two years into exchanges. As you are looking at your small group, that $800 million EBIT headwind \u2013 sorry $800 million to $400 million that you had articulated. When you look at it across, firstly, is that stemmed at this point? When you look at it across small group and individual, are you coming out net positive? Is it net neutral? Or is it continuing to be a headwind? And how do you expect that going forward into 2016 and then 2017?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning. Thanks for the question. I would say the catcher's-mitt strategy itself is working as we would expect as we are clearly seeing attrition in lines of business. Small group alone lost over 100,000 lives in the fourth quarter. Clearly, we're picking up those lives elsewhere as we were able to exceed our membership targets for the year. I would say, the part of the strategy that's not coming to light at this point isn't about capturing the member now, but where exactly that member is caught and the revenue associated with that member. I think at this point, when we've built our five-year plan, we fully expect that more of these lives will be picked up in the public exchanges as a fully insured.","We are finding that some of those lives now are actually getting employed, and more in an ASO market, or we are picking them up on Medicaid, which in some case has a lower PMPM than (39:21) we would have got on the public exchange. So ultimately, I would say the strategy of the catcher's mitt itself is working in terms of getting the customers and continuing to grow membership, but I would say the mix of membership and how it translates to revenue is not panning out as we had anticipated.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","And then following up on that, just now on the public exchanges, but your decline in individual from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, was that mainly the special enrollment period folks that did that? And as you're looking out into 2017 as reinsurance goes away, do you think the policy changes that the administration is making would still allow you to remain on exchange and be profitable into 2017? Is this, again, part of your catcher's mitt?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ana, this is Joe. Let me comment on the kind of the continued engagement that we envision the exchanges. Yes, we are certainly very observant of the shifts and changes that the administration is enacting, especially paying a lot of attention to special enrollment period. Very thankful the administration has made some changes. I suspect there may be more changes in the near future which we want to consider very carefully so that we can judge the sustainability of the exchange marketplace and how well we can engage in that marketplace going forward.","So we're very observant regarding these moves and changes. We feel that, as Wayne pointed out a moment ago, we're extremely well positioned with respect to matters like G&A that allows us to perform in this space reasonably well. Notwithstanding member deterioration, it's presumably stabilized given what we're observing regarding some uptick in membership for 2016, which obviously, as Wayne pointed out, we'll probably know more within the month. But nonetheless, we're really carefully observing it, looking at special enrollment in terms of its potential impact, and again we're very hopeful that some of the issues will be ameliorated in terms of the risk and we'll have a much more sustainable marketplace to engage in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Scott J. Fidel - Credit Suisse","Thanks. First question, just if you can give us an update on how the implementation of Iowa Medicaid is coming along? And just interested just in the context of the state having removed WellCare from the contract? What your updated enrollment expectation is for Iowa? And then what type of losses you're building in and expecting? Obviously, United did increase their PDR for Iowa as a result of that, so just interested in how you're approaching this?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Scott, good morning. First of all, relative to Iowa, we continue to be optimistic about this program in the long term and that it will have the similar trajectory of we expect to lose money in year one, get closer to breakeven in year two, and then return to profitability by year three. We got an update from the team yesterday. Actually Joe and the senior leadership team got a full, deep dive on where things are progressing and things are moving exactly as we would have expected at this point. We're very close to starting that implementation on 3\/1\/2016.","We don't have line of sight of what membership we may or may not get. As you know, there are a number of appeals that have been filed both by the one individual that was selected that has been told they were being removed, as well as others that were not selected in the first round, so we have not included any of that and we want to see how that pans out.","That being said, if you were to look at Medicaid all in, both margin compressions that we were receiving throughout the year, that we expect. Plus we're assuming even further margin pressure in the back half of 2016 from states, as well as expansion. There's about a few hundred million dollar headwind baked in, but I would tell you that Iowa is less than 25% of that. So it gives you kind of a gauge of how we're envisioning year one to evolve, and then migrate more to year two, and then from there to the normal profitability we would have in these programs. The delay of two months is part of the reason for that level of loss in year one because ultimately we've got the G&A float happening, but we don't have the revenue yet.","Scott J. Fidel - Credit Suisse","Got it. Okay. And then just had a follow-up question just on small group. And actually a number that I don't think we've talked about for a few quarters. But just interested \u2013 remember a couple years back you had talked about how small group would potentially have to absorb maybe a $400 million EBIT hit from ACA as thinking about both sort of margin rebasement, and then enrollment attrition. And just interested if you can give us an update on sort of how you're tracking relative to that number? Obviously, there has been recent attrition, but just interested if we're sort of at that number? Or still some ways to go? Or just where we stand relative to that?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So relative to the $400 million, Scott, which was more about margin reset, I'd say we've taken our medicine on that $400 million over the last couple of years. Now it becomes a question of, will small group continue to migrate to other lines of business over time around just pure membership? But we have taken that sizeable hit. As we saw in the fourth quarter, a very sizeable chunk of that membership migrated away from fully insured. And the question is, will we recover that even through the public exchanges and open enrollment or others? Again, our early open enrollment data would imply we are recovering it, but we want to see what actually converts to a pay by the end of the month. But I'd say in terms of the margin compression, we've taken a substantial portion of that $400 million.","Scott J. Fidel - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Yes, hi. Good morning. If I could just go back to the exchanges for a moment again, a couple questions there. When you talked about the unsustainable price competition and also the lack of market growth, should we read that the decline that you're expecting of $300,000 is all about the unsustainable price competition since, if the market didn't grow then maybe you would expect it to be flat? And my follow-up question to that is, as we look to 2017, how much impact \u2013 favorable impact do you think you'll get from the risk pool as grandmothering plans work their way into the exchanges? Albeit, I know it is not going to be the case for your two largest markets, California and New York.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Matt, I appreciate the questions. A couple of thoughts or at least insights. One is yes, we are assuming that some of the pricing that we continue to see in our markets, our 14 states, is still well below what we think appropriate rates are for a sustainable environment. I think the fact that we're closer to breakeven in 2015 and a profit margin that's below the targeted 3% to 5% in 2016 I think is a good indication of our price point isn't wrong, as much as others need to strengthen their price points. So we are going to assume that the strengthening is not occurring. In fact, we know in many states it hasn't occurred, and that we will continue to trade members.","That being said, we are starting to see individuals start to recognize the problems in their books. They are starting to strengthen their pricing quite meaningfully. We are seeing co-ops struggle in the moment with more than half of those now insolvent. So the question comes, will the market start to harden going into 2017? Which has really two effects for us. One is we no longer have the diminishing membership base. But more importantly, we should be, hopefully, a net recipient of that and hopefully start getting some of that revenue back that we talked about in our original five-year outlook.","And then relative to 2017, Matt, to your comment with grandmothering. It's really hard to say at this point, the behaviors of the dynamics of what will the market look like in 2017, not just the exchanges, and how grandmothering, but just what's the global economy and the U.S. economy is doing? What implications does that have as well. But the theory of what you laid out would imply that you are going to get more of those lives in that are a healthier population, and should help improve the overall profitability of the book as well. But as you indicated, in our largest markets, we did not allow grandfathering in many cases, and we migrated already. So it won't have as big of an impact, but if the market has hardened, it should improve for us.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for the question. A couple of years ago and clearly last few actual years, we've talked about consumerization of healthcare and the growth of private exchanges, and we really haven't seen that come through in a significant way. Here we are in second year with that not delivering much membership growth. Can you tell us how you're evolving your strategy on consumerization in private exchanges?","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, this is Joe. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think private exchanges have had a slow uptake probably for a few reasons. But I think it was considered as sort of an offset to the Cadillac tax exposure and other necessities that business and industry considered in terms of moving their employees into a private exchange marketplace. It didn't materialize to the level of speed that anybody anticipated in the early going. And our position at the moment is that we are kind of taking a more muted response to the private exchange formation and execution.","Nonetheless, we're going to be ready if and when it does accelerate, and it may very well do so in the future. But at this stage, it really is a sort of a muted response to that strategy. And we believe what you're seeing nationally is sort of an in-market standard in terms of private exchanges is simply not picking up the speed that folks had originally anticipated.","So we're basically waiting, wait and see, and we're positioned \u2013 and in fact, we do have private exchange membership that is not a substantial part of our membership, but certainly we are in the space. I guess bottom line is, affordability is still the key and remains critical to long-term positioning on part of employers. And as private exchange presents itself as a solution, we are ready, willing and able to engage in a meaningful way. But again, I think our response at this stage is fairly muted given it's been such a slow uptake.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. This is just a follow-up if you don't mind. Can you talk about the premium tax issue in California and your exposure to that in terms of the litigation against your company?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi Pete. Let me just first highlight that in California the tax laws differ based on legal entity, very similar to any legal entity in the United States has different tax laws. We pay our taxes exactly as the law states within the state of California, as do our competitors that have similar legal entities filed there. And the DMHC has actually agreed that we're paying taxes in accordance with the law. So at this point I can simply state that it is fully our intention to follow the law as we've done so far and it is fully our intention to litigate any action brought against us that would imply otherwise. And so there's nothing more to comment on beyond that other than you should be aware that it is the law that we are following under and the DMHC has supported us in that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Just quickly here on the government segment. I know Wayne, I think you said you're expecting to earn about $200 million less in Medicaid but grow a little bit in Medicare. Net-net, is it going to be flattish or down in the government segment in 2016?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good question. It's going to be slightly down, which gives you a pretty good idea of how well our Medicare is actually performing. But it will be slightly down between those. And again, it's important to recognize we thought it was prudent to have a cautious posture on how Medicaid rates may evolve as the year progresses. So not just the rates we know about in October but what happens in mid-July as well as next October.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. And then just on the reinsurance, can you quantify how much you expect from \u2013 how much you expect to receive in 2015 and \u2013 would you have lost money without that amount? Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think the first thing to keep in mind is we're just assuming just slightly over 50%. You know, I don't think you can look at it as whether you would lose money with or without that amount because it's important to recognize we're collecting that premium within our premium base on behalf of the government and then submitting that into the reinsurance pool. So our pricing is baked with an assumption that we will get what the law says we're entitled to get without it. So I don't think you can look at it with or without the program because the pricing is built with that program. That being said, as you know there's data points out there that would imply that people may recover as much as 55% to 60% and, again, we're much more aligned with where the law is. When I say slightly over 50%, it doesn't even round up to 51%. So it gives you a little bit of a feel for we're just barely over 50%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Could you maybe talk a little bit more on Medicare? Obviously, seen some significant improvements in 2015, calling for continued improvements in 2016, but how should we think about how much room is left beyond that as well as maybe the level of investments currently in Medicare for the repositioning? And will some of that start winding down in 2016, 2017? Thanks.","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Joe again. You know, since I joined the company a few years ago, we really put a stake in the ground that we were going to reposition ourselves in the Medicare space very aggressively. We established \u2013 as I said a moment ago, a three-year plan, and we're well into that three-year plan realization in terms of our targets. The margins we expect to expand over time, and we do believe that we're really heavily focused on medical cost management capabilities and we have an increased focus on our administrative cost structure as being a key contributor to margin improvement. So when you put all that together, we're witnessing a substantial \u2013 I'd call it even a turnaround in our Medicare book that really gives us cause for optimism going forward.","We really do remain very pleased with the success that we've created with the team and I'm hopeful that as we get through 2016 and well into 2017 that we'll be able to report on a trajectory that's on a positive track.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just real quick on seasonality, here. I mean, it's obviously increasingly front-half loaded. Should we view 2015 seasonality as kind of the framework for 2016, or is there any changes that could swing those numbers? Thanks.","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Andy, great question. I would think the seasonality in 2015 will be more reflective of what you'll see in 2016. Just keep in mind the wild card in all of this is really going to be around how these 3Rs ultimately settle out from our perspective. Again, we believe we've been prudent at booking to a conservative point of view, but as more data comes out on those 3Rs, that could create some unique nuances throughout the year. And also how these co-ops evolve throughout the year and how the states plan to solve for that could create nuances into 2016. But generally speaking, 2015 is a pretty good proxy for the seasonality you should expect in 2016.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Sarah James from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you. You mentioned some potential headwinds on Medicaid rates for 2016, and you're not the first company to spike out that concern. So what are you currently building into guidance for your blended rates in 2016? What was it in 2015? And can you talk about how you view margins on that business for legacy Medicaids, excluding Iowa or any new contracts? How do you think about margins developing for Medicaid?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So good question. One is, though, I do want to highlight, we don't generally give blended rate increases. As you know, it varies by state and because of the underlying economics of each state vary dramatically, we would prefer not to blend them together in a broad discussion. That being said, though, Sarah, I think it's a fair question to understand that we have margins that are exceeding what we believe are our long-term sustainable optimal margins, but know that we are still assuming that we will blend closer to a 5% margin, all in, going into next year. Now, that's higher than what you've typically heard for Medicaid, which would be the 2% to 3% margin range, but it's important to recognize that we do get a gross-up for the health insurer fee as well, so that bumps those margins further.","But we think that the guidance we've provided puts us at what hopefully will be a sustainable out-performance margin for us. We believe we should have a better margin because we believe we can execute on this better, and the team that we've brought in from the Amerigroup almost three years now has done an exceptional job in that space. But our pricing assumes slowly landing the plane on those margins to get to more of that sustainable long-term margin.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. And was there anything moving pieces-wise in the quarter from Medicaid, like a flu benefit? Or I think in the past, you had mentioned the potential for a retroactive premium payment? So is there anything out-of-period or unusual that we should think about with this quarter's Medicaid performance?","Wayne S. DeVeydt - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, nothing unusual in terms of the actual numbers. Things tied out where we thought they would tie out. What was a little unusual was more on the cash flow. We actually had a couple of large vendors in a couple states in particular pay us on the last day of the year for rates we typically get in the first five days of the New Year. So it affected cash flow, but it didn't actually affect the underlying economics of what we had assumed.","Operator","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the conference back to the company's management for closing comments.","Joseph R. Swedish - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you all for your questions this morning. In summary, we're pleased with our 2015 results and believe the increasing diversification of our business positions us well for 2016 and beyond. As you've heard, our team remains focused on executing on our core business while preparing for the integration of our Cigna acquisition. We expect to close in the second half of the year.","I want to thank you all for being with us today and I especially want to thank our associates for their ongoing contributions and their commitment to serving our 38.6 million customers every day.

Later, there will be a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Anthem, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to Anthem's second quarter 2018 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division.","Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our second quarter financial results, followed by commentary around our focus on execution and our enterprise-wide growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail and go over our updated 2018 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A.","During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com.","We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise all listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Gail.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Anthem's second quarter 2018 earnings call. Today, we reported second quarter 2018 GAAP earnings per share of $3.98 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.25, which are ahead of expectations. Our second quarter results reflect our ongoing commitment to improve execution across our enterprise.","Anthem's second quarter operating revenue grew 2.3% over the prior year quarter to $22.7 billion. The increase in operating revenue was driven by growth in our Government business that more than offset the headwinds presented by the planned reduction in our Individual business. Service fee revenue was up, a direct result of our efforts to improve sales of our consumer-centric clinical engagement programs within our self-funded book.","Membership declined sequentially by 129,000 lives, attributable to declines in both our Commercial and Medicaid businesses. The Commercial membership results in the second quarter remain inconsistent with our expectations and do not yet reflect the initiatives that are expected to drive improvement. The decrease in Medicaid was due to a reduction in TANF members due to an improving economy and continued redetermination of eligibility efforts by states.","Our focus on managing the overall health of our members resulted in another quarter of solid medical cost performance. Anthem's medical cost ratio in the second quarter was 83.4%, better than expectations and down slightly year-to-year when normalized for the health insurer fee. Our SG&A ratio was in line with expectations at 15.1%, leading to a favorable second quarter operating margin of 6.9%.","Turning to our outlook, we expect the positive momentum exhibited in the first half of 2018 to carry forward to the balance of the year. Further, we remain focused on accelerating revenue growth, while continuously providing our members with trusted caring solutions. Based on our strong first half financial performance, we are raising our full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share outlook to greater than $15.40, a 28% increase from 2017.","In our Commercial business, we continued to build our segment strategy and increased our focus on sales execution. As we have previously noted, the reinstitution of the health insurer fee was a catalyst for our employer partners to shop for flexible plan designs and we did not move quickly enough to pivot to their needs.","Our new strategy enables more consistent and effective product deployment, sales training and broker service across our 14 states, while allowing for flexibility and choice in the local market. Leadership and structure is now in place and we are intensely focused on building momentum for growth in 2019 and beyond by increasing our agility and speed to market.","An example of this is our recently announced partnership with Samsung and American Well. Through this partnership, consumers with an Anthem affiliated health plan can use the Samsung Health app to access LiveHealth Online, which connects consumers with U.S. based board-certified health care providers for a wide variety of non-emergency medical care 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We expect to see growing momentum in membership retention and growth as we move into 2019.","Although the 2019 national account selling season is still underway, we are seeing signs that Anthem's integrated clinical capabilities are resonating. Our pricing strategies in the Commercial segment remain disciplined and our pre-tax segment margin targets are unchanged. Overall, we believe the pricing environment is rational.","Turning to our Government business, we recently announced that Felicia Norwood has been appointed President. Felicia has over 25 years of commercial and government health care experience and was most recently serving as the Director of the Illinois' Department of Healthcare and Family Services. In this role, Felicia will be able to apply her valuable insight and experience to drive persistent growth in our Government division.","We have significantly scaled our Medicare platform over the last seven months with the acquisition of HealthSun and America's 1st Choice. As we look ahead, we will seek a balance between both membership growth and margin retention. We recently submitted our planned bids for 2019 with this in mind and we continue to believe that mid double-digit organic membership growth remains in reach over the near-term. Approximately 70% of our membership is in plans rated four stars or higher and we have five five-Star plans, the most in our industry.","Acquisitions have been a key element of our Medicare Advantage growth strategy. But given our star profile, market share gains and adjacent county expansions present the most capital-efficient means to increase profitability. We are targeting growth in both the dual and non-dual Medicare population. However, we believe Anthem is uniquely positioned to serve the needs of the medically complex dual eligible population because of our industry-leading Medicaid platform and our provider collaboration initiatives like Enhanced Personal Health Care.","We expect to increase our county footprint meaningfully in 2019, but in aggregate, the largest source of near-term growth resides in our ability to go deeper and get stronger in the regions where we currently operate. The group Medicare Advantage market is a significant untapped opportunity and we feel that our existing Commercial business and trusted brand give us an unmatched competitive advantage. Combined with improved Star scores and Anthem's innovative community-based programs and integrated clinical arrangements we are poised for growth in the group MA segment.","Anthem has historically been uncompetitive in this area, but as we look ahead, we are certain we can increase our market share. As one of the most trusted consumer brands, we are confident that we bring an improved value proposition to the group retiree segment, a value proposition that will only improve with IngenioRx beginning in 2020.","Several recent group Medicare wins support our optimism. We expect our group MA business will more than double in the back half of 2018, albeit off a base of 26,000 members at the end of the second quarter. Early indicators suggest this enrollment success can be sustained into next year.","In the Medicaid segment, we continue to see a growth pipeline of $80 billion over the next five years, largely by serving the needs of higher acuity and specialty population. Of note, during the second quarter, we were awarded a statewide contract to serve Florida's HIV population.","We were also proud to announce that we recently received two Case in Point Platinum Awards, which recognize the most successful and innovative case management program. Our health care solutions, Behavioral Health Homeless Case Management Program and Diabetic Clinic Days Program each won their respective categories.","Our partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota is expected to go live in the fourth quarter of 2018 and serve 375,000 Medicaid and dual-eligible members. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2019, we are also encouraged by the opportunity to serve a portion of the 400,000 Virginia Medicaid expansion population.","During the second quarter, we completed with the acquisition of Aspire Health, furthering our clinical capabilities through a network of interdisciplinary skilled medical professionals that provide comprehensive care in the home for patients facing a serious illness. Aspire currently serves more than 20 health plans across 25 states.","Additionally, we are pleased with the progress in our integration planning ahead of the launch of IngenioRx on January 1, 2020. We feel our gross savings target of $4 billion annually is prudent and expect at least 20% of the saving to flow through to our bottom line.","Before passing the call over to John, I would like to offer some high-level thoughts about our future. As I look across the competitive landscape, I'm confident that Anthem is well-positioned to gain market share in our key business segments.","I am often asked what has surprised me most since joining Anthem. And my answer is that I'm extremely impressed by the depth and breadth of our clinical and network capabilities, and our ability to drive affordable solutions despite a significant pharmacy disadvantage. This is a testament to the strength of our company and the power of our deep local market engagement.","Looking ahead, we're excited about the opportunities to better manage the burden of health care inflation for both our current and potential customers. The rollout of IngenioRx in 2020 is a paramount importance to our objectives. The foundation of our PBM strategy is built on bringing the most clinically effective and financially efficient pharmacy solutions to our members, an approach that is predicated on the overall cost of care and not rebate maximization.","To conclude, we're excited about the growth opportunities we see in the balance of 2018 and 2019 as we bridge the gap to 2020, the inflection point for Anthem as we align our best in class medical cost position and consumer responsive solutions with a greatly improved pharmacy offering.","With that, I'll pass the call over to John for a more detailed review of our second quarter financial performance and updated 2018 guidance.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As Gail stated, we reported strong second quarter financial results with GAAP earnings per share of $3.98 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.25.","Operating revenue in the second quarter was $22.7 billion, an increase of 2.3% versus the prior year quarter. The growth in operating revenue is a result of the acquisitions of HealthSun and America's 1st Choice, in addition to premium rate increases to cover the return of the health insurance tax in 2018.","The revenue growth in the quarter comes despite our voluntary decision to reduce our individual ACA footprint, which has resulted in a 55% decline in our individual membership since the end of 2017.","Enrollment declined by 129,000 members during the quarter, or 0.3%, bringing total enrollment to 39.5 million members. Fully insured membership decreased by 103,000 members sequentially, driven largely by declines in Medicaid and continued attrition in our Individual business. Fully insured declines were partially offset by organic growth in Medicare, which grew by approximately 25,000 lives.","Our medical loss ratio was 83.4% for the second quarter, a decrease of 270 basis points from the prior year quarter. The decline was primarily driven by the reinstitution of the health insurance tax in 2018. However, our medical loss ratio further improved as a result of the strong medical cost performance in both our Commercial and Government businesses.","This improvement is seen in our strong gross margin results across multiple lines of businesses. Our results in the quarter reflect our commitment to improve the total cost of care through various programs such as our innovative clinical and value-based care arrangements.","Based on the success of our care management initiatives and our overall performance to date, we continue to expect our local group insured medical cost trend to be in the range of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points.","As Gail mentioned, our SG&A expense ratio was 15.1% in the second quarter, an increase of 130 basis points relative to the second quarter of 2017. The increase is driven by the return of the health insurance tax in 2018 in addition to increased investment spend to fund future growth, partially offset by the settlement related to the 2015 cyber attack which was recorded in the second quarter of 2017. Looking ahead, we will continue to prioritize investment spending in growth initiatives across the enterprise.","Turning to the balance sheet. As has been our practice, we have included a roll forward of our medical claims payable balance in this morning's press release. We experienced favorable prior year reserve development of approximately $800 million for the first six months of 2018, slightly ahead of our expectations. Our reserves continue to include a provision for average deviation in the mid to high single digit range. And we believe our reserve balances remain consistent and strong as of June 30, 2018.","Days in claims payable was 38.7 days in the second quarter, decreasing by 1.6 days sequentially and in line with our high 30s target. The decrease was driven by our focus on improving our claims processing systems, ultimately leading to faster claims payment cycle times, and the impact of the timing of the acquisition of America's 1st Choice on the first quarter days in claims payable metric.","Our debt to cap ratio was 40.2% as of June 30, 2018, a decrease of 220 basis points compared to the first quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by the conversion of $1.25 billion of equity units, which were originally issued in 2012 and matured in early May, as well as a modest reduction of our short-term borrowings. Our debt to cap ratio is in line with our targeted range and is at a sustainable level.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $229.75 per share, totaling approximately $400 million. In addition, we distributed $196 million during the quarter for our cash dividend. As of yesterday, our audit committee approved a third quarter dividend of $0.75 per share. Taken together, we ended the second quarter with approximately $2.2 billion in cash and investments at the parent company.","Operating cash flow was $542 million in the quarter, up versus $393 million in the prior year quarter. For the first six months of 2018, operating cash flow was approximately $2.8 billion or 1.2 times net income and is in line with our expectations.","Looking ahead to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we now expect fully insured enrollment to be in the range of 14.6 million to 14.7 million members by the end of the year. Our revised outlook takes into consideration the greater than projected membership decline in the second quarter and a more modest growth outlook for the remainder of 2018.","In the second half of 2018, our membership outlook continues to include growth of approximately 375,000 Medicaid members in Minnesota, organic Medicare Advantage gains and recent wins in the group retiree business.","Self-funded membership is expected to be in the range of 25.3 million to 25.4 million members, unchanged from prior guidance. In total, we now expect medical membership to end the year within the range of 39.9 million to 40.1 million lives, down 200,000 at the midpoint, due to the previously noted trends in our fully insured business.","As Gail mentioned, heading into 2019, we remain focused on improving our sales execution through the segment strategy and building positive momentum in the Commercial business. Our medical cost ratio and SG&A guidance is unchanged as the first half results track largely in line with our expectations.","Below the line, we estimate our diluted share count would be in the range of 263 million to 265 million shares, up from the 260 million to 264 million shares due to the conversion of our equity units in May, which increased our share count by 6 million shares. We narrowed our effective tax rate to a range of 26.5% to 27.5% from the 25.5% to 27.5% previously.","Finally, we increased our investment income guidance by $75 million due to higher short-term interest rate yields, partially offsetting the share count and the tax rate adjustments. Taken together and reflecting our strong year-to-date medical cost performance, we now expect full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $15.40.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit on the cross-selling progress you're having and just overall getting the earnings up in kind of the self-insured block. You'd noted service fee revenues being up. But if you could talk a little bit about kind of the progress you're making thus far, but really your strategies for driving up kind of cross-selling and overall earnings per member?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Good morning, Lance. Thank you for the question. In terms of \u2013 we are pleased with some of the progress that we're making as you saw in terms of our self-funded revenue. A couple of the areas, in particular, we have had a focus around adding some of our clinical programs as well as our specialty, so dental life. Part of what you're not seeing is in the penetration rate because a lot of our specialty products were tied to our individual business, so that overall is down, but we actually have seen a nice progress in sales of those specialty.","Again, in terms of strategies, I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian who leads that business to give you a little bit of insight, but it's been an area of focus in a couple of areas. Structure, we've put some very specific structures in place around our segments. We've added additional leadership and talent to that area, and as part of that we're seeing that come through in the first quarter as well as the second and we would expect to see ongoing momentum. But let me ask Pete to give you a little bit more color on that as well.","Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the question. I agree with everything that Gail said. I think we have a tremendous opportunity with respect to improving our specialty penetration rates. As we have said before, relative to the competition, we are not performing as well and there's just tremendous opportunity to improve that.","I think what Gail has said is really the most important point and that is our focus on building out the infrastructure for this, so we've hired talent; we're making investment in the specialty organization. We feel very confident that we have the products and the services and the pricing in a place where it makes a lot of sense right now and it's how that then connects with our segment strategy and making sure we're driving sales down into the market.","In addition to that, we're very focused on improvements from a broker perspective and providing tools and engagements for the brokers to be able to more effectively upsell. So we think there's a tremendous opportunity to continue to sell clinical programs and our specialty products into our existing book and we are seeing really good progress in that regard.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Next is from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe, now, having two quarters under our belt, we can start to look at first half versus second half and I'm particularly focused on the MLR outlook. While you're maintaining that, that implies a pick up in the back half versus first half MLR by about 320 basis points at the low end of the range and 400 basis points at the high end of the range. Moving back and looked at last year, you were first half to second half about 290 basis points. I guess, with the decline in the Individual business, which has a seasonal ramp in the back half of the year, we'd probably thought the ramp might be less. Is there \u2013 are we just being conservative, or are there some things to point to why that pick up in MLR in the back half of the year would look that significant?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, A.J., and thank you for the question. As you indicated in your question, you essentially answered the question associated with the seasonality issues and the fact that our Individual business, as everyone knows, we reduced our footprint in the ACA-compliant marketplace by over 55% year-over-year and that clearly is changing the trajectory of MLR on a quarter-by-quarter basis.","Anyway, if you just look at the overall mix of our fully insured business, we acquired America's 1st Choice in February, we acquired HealthSun back in December, and those have a slightly different seasonality pattern from what we had a year ago in terms of adding all those Medicare Advantage lives along with all the double-digit organic Medicare advantage growth that we had. So it's all those things combined, but the single biggest factor, as you pointed out, is the Individual marketplace.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners, please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning. The questions on the Commercial fully insured turnaround that Gail, you and Peter are leading, and you talked about growth in the fully insured market. I was curious where the market share is likely to come from. Is it that it will come from players like Cigna which have been taking share from fully insured, or is it more from the large nationals like Aetna and United or smaller players? And then also, will the margins, and they've expanded really nicely on your Commercial book and I'm not sure if it's the core underwriting or its mix of business, will the margins stay where they are in your Commercial book overall?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Ana. There's a number of questions in there and let me start and, again, I'll ask Pete to share a little bit more color. First in terms of growth, as I shared, we have made a number of changes inside of our Commercial organization and we expect those to start taking hold, as I would say, over the next few quarters. Those take a little bit of time to implement. But each of our markets is very different. Our Commercial markets, as you know, we operate in 14 markets and I would tell you that we expect to see improvements because of the improved focus on sales execution, our value story across the board in small and large groups.","In terms of which specific competitors, they are all different in each of our markets. So, I'm not going to point to a specific one because we compete differentially, for example, in small group and Individual versus different competitors in each market.","We are staying very disciplined to pricing, so let me start with that in terms of your margin question. Overall, our margins, we have had also a focus on buy-ups inside of our fully insured as well as self-funded. Some of the things that I shared with you on the very first question have also helped drive our margins. But overall pricing, we've stay disciplined. I think we've always had a very consistent underwriting function and we continue to have that.","But with that, let me ask Pete maybe to share some additional insight into some of the strategies that are going into the marketplace and some of the different product offerings, because that is one of the areas that we focused on and expect to see some improvement.","Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah, Ana, thanks for the question. To be more specific about, I think your first question was on progress and how we're doing against our strategy. So, I put it in the following categories. First, with respect to the segment strategy, I think we're down a really good path and we are very much focused on ensuring that we have the right leadership in each one of the segments, and we completed that over the last 60 days.","In addition to that, I call them centers of excellence, very much focused on building the infrastructure for sales execution, having the appropriate reporting and the execution downstream both in the markets, but also coordinated with our centralized organization. We've hired strong leadership in that regard that has been there and done that in other large organizations. We've also made a lot of progress with respect to products and product options.","And then with respect to underwriting, building an infrastructure that's more agile, back to the point that Gail made. The point here is that we need to be more agile. We need to be able to offer products, services and connect those with the right networks in a more expeditious and agile way. And so we're seeing really good progress in building that out.","I'd also say with respect to the way we're manufacturing products, we call it product modularization, but this is really the concept of how we build products internally, so being able to do that more effectively and efficiently, and then how products are chosen in the marketplace through digital capabilities and allowing brokers and employers to make choices on products and networks more effectively.","And then finally, I mentioned it before, but how we're engaging with brokers. We're seeing really good progress on how we're servicing brokers. So we've taken that and really focused on centralizing that to a greater degree for better execution and then the tools and services that they're utilizing out in the marketplace and enabling them to a better degree.","So, all that, we're seeing really good progress. I think we'll see momentum in the back half of the year. I think a reasonable proof point when you, sort of, look at all that is what we've done with the group retiree business. I mean, that is a segment where we started this a little bit earlier. And as you've seen, we had some nice sales in July and I think we're going to continue to see momentum in that segment. So hopefully that's representative of what we'll see in the other segments in the near-term.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you. And, Ana, I think you can see from Pete's comments, it's a pretty comprehensive focus on execution around each of the levers and so, obviously, we think we're going to see some nice momentum. Next question, please.","Operator","The line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research, please go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Was hoping you could give us some color on how the company is looking at 2019 from the perspective of its footprint in the exchanges in Medicare Advantage. And then, if I could sneak in one more, John, you increased the tax rate at the midpoint by 50 bps, which is curious given the earnings upside and the core business should be driving a lower tax rate all things being equal, given with deductibility accounting, so hoping you can give us some more color there on what's driving this and whether the tax rate should revert back in 2019 to the original guidance, or is this a new run rate? Thanks.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thanks, Justin. Let me begin and then I'll turn it over to John. I think a couple questions around footprint. I know you asked about Medicare Advantage and I think you slipped in individual exchanges too, so I'll try to address both.","First on the individual exchanges, we are not looking to rescale the business, first and foremost, but we do \u2013 we are very pleased with the participation we've had this year and the results of that. And I think our team has done an excellent job of identifying the markets where it makes sense, where we think that we've got a stable presence and offering.","As we go into 2019, while no decisions are final yet, we are assessing that. I think you'll see some county expansions, but I think more focused on the areas that we've been this year, so not a major rescaling, but we are pleased with the performance. And again, it is all about stability and more certainty around that marketplace. But again, this year was solid.","In terms of the Medicare Advantage marketplace, as I shared in my opening comments, we have really reconstructed our MA book of business and feel going into 2019 that we have taken a very balanced approach. We think the market is strong. We feel that we can grow deeper in the market that we're in. We do have some geographic expansion. I won't go into the numbers on that, because we think that's competitive.","However, we do think we will grow above industry rates. And we do feel that that growth will come from deeper penetration with the strong quality assets that we have in our markets. We feel very good about our positioning and the stability of our benefits and the flexibility that this year's guidance gave us.","With that, I'll ask John to comment on your second question.","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah, thank you, Gail, and, Justin, good morning. In terms of the tax rate, we did raise the guidance at the midpoint basically by taking up the lower end of the range. Our tax rate for the quarter is still within the range that we provided, in the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year, although closer to the higher end. We're certainly very proactive in terms of our approach to tax planning.","Our tax rate is still low relative to our peer group. But in terms of where we are, there's multiple factors that go into the rate in terms of where do we make our money? Some municipalities are premium tax, some are income tax. So based on where the money is earned can change the tax rate.","We have things, like fine-tuning the HIF, in terms of the adjustments on that, impacts primary differences and impacts the tax rate. So we've refined all these things. We think the tax rate that we have laid out there is very appropriate for 2018.","And then in regards to 2019, 2019, the health insurer fee goes away. As we all know, that's a non-deductible fee which increases the effective tax rate significantly. So in 2019, our effective tax rate will be much closer to the statutory tax rate than it is now.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","It's from the line of Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes. Hi. Good morning. I was hoping maybe you could just talk about the group retiree traction that you pointed to, along with the \u2013 if it relates together, the group Medicare Advantage untapped opportunity or lightly tapped opportunity that you're pursuing, and how those two might come together if they do come together?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Sure. Well, thank you for the question. As I shared a few minutes ago, group Medicare is really a market that we identified early that we had historically under invested in both at Anthem and I think quite frankly across the Blue system.","As we have improved our individual MA book of business, particularly improving our Stars performance, our operational performance, putting in a team that really understands that business over the last few years and have begun to gain traction in the individual MA business, we turned our attention to the group MA business.","We obviously feel we have a very strong pipeline of commercial customers who want to stay Blue. We think that that brand resonates very well in this community. Plus having four plus Star plan that we're able to put our group retiree segment into. And then we recruited an experienced leadership team to lead that over the last year.","So as you think about those elements, the scaled infrastructure, a really strong brand, our ability to use our CareMore assets to support and service that business, our ability \u2013 we found that now we're able to convert some of those memberships. We've seen some of those groups \u2013 rather, we've seen some of that traction already in 2018. And we feel very good about the pipeline and our opportunities that we'll be able to continue that growth into 2019 and beyond.","So we're very bullish about group MA. And again, it's because we have known many of these customers throughout their lives. I mean, we've had them for 20, 30 years. And that's a wonderful pipeline that we just have under invested in in the past. So it's an area of focus and talent for us right now, so we would expect to see some significant traction.","Next question, please.","Operator","It's the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. Should we think about the analytics, PBM and other products that you're selling externally to other insurers as off-the-shelf Anthem solutions? Or is it more of a partnership approach to product development? And if it is a partnership, how important is Anthem's flexibility in the conversations that you've had so far? And do you lose anything in synergies or benefits at scale if you're running a portfolio of customized products? Thanks.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Well, good morning, Sarah. I think there is, again, a couple questions embedded. First and foremost, as you know, we're standing up IngenioRx for effective, 1\/1\/2020.","And as part of that, while we are in the market now, so I guess I would say, it's not \u2013 we're not completely converted of our own business yet. But as you think about, we've talked about some of the things that we're selling in the industry to other Blues like our Medicaid partnerships. And we've been able to do that very well by customizing, but still leveraging our scale.","And in the PBM business, with IngenioRx, our early conversations I think demonstrate that we can do the same thing, that we are pretty confident in that we're standing up a PBM with very, very strong economics. That we're also standing it up and we don't basically have the old model PBM. We can integrate pharmacy, behavioral, some of the social determinant issues, as well as medical.","And as we've looked at some of the things that are out in the marketplace right now, we're pretty confident that we have an ability to meet \u2013 at least meet or beat many of the numbers that have been put out there because again, we see it as part of our continued strategy of whole health management.","And to your specific question around scale and customization, given the flexibility of what we've been able to build, we feel pretty confident that we have the right amount of flexibility for the clients that we're talking to and be able to serve their needs.","But again, this is a deep integration story as well. And we already have products that do some of that for Anthem itself, and we're looking to be able to scale those to others.","Next question, please.","Operator","It's the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the commercial risk. It looks like you lowered enrollment guidance for fully insured and I know that includes Medicaid and Medicare. But it sounded like there were some gross adds on the Medicaid and obviously MA and group commentary that you had. So hoping maybe you can just flesh out the commercial risk sort of ex-exchange and kind of what's going on there. And then when you talk about sort of the flexibility and the strategy as we think about next year and growth, is that just the commercial market in general, or is that specific to seeing growth in the commercial risk segment that's obviously seeing a little bit of a slowdown? Thanks.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Ralph. In terms of our overall guidance, we did lower it by 200,000 at the risk membership, but that still implies growth of 375,000 to 475,000 in the back half of the year.","As John shared with you and I did in my remarks, we know that we're bringing on Minnesota in our Medicaid alliance later this year. We do expect some growth in our group Medicare. We also know that our Individual business will still have some attrition as is typical in that business in the back half of the year. As we think of the overall rest of our Commercial group business, we would expect that to be flat to fairly modest growth. So that's how we're thinking about all of those pieces.","In terms of the marketplace itself, maybe, Pete can make \u2013 give you some color and commentary on the marketplace, where we kind of expect to see opportunities.","Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I \u2013 without speaking about particular markets, I think what Gail touched upon before, every market is different. We have different competitors and markets. We believe with the strategy that we're deploying and the higher level of execution and the product options that we're talking about, we can take share. And we're beginning, like I said, to see that momentum and we feel confident that going into 2019 we can do that, Ralph. So I wouldn't talk about a particular geography or product, but feel confident that we're going to see momentum going into 2019.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","It's the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Could you tell us more about the Medicare group lives that you're picking up? You talked about increasing that going into the back half of the year. We can see already in July from the government data that you picked up 36,000 Medicare group lives. So can you tell us are these conversions from your commercial retirees and how many commercial retirees do you have on the books right now?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thanks for the question. In terms of where most of those are, many of them are Blue Cross Blue Shield commercial customers. So, yes, that is the majority of them, although we are quoting on some customers that are not currently, some of those we're picking up from some of our competitors as well. So I think it's a bit of a mix. But our opportunity is clearly inside of our own commercial book.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","The line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. You mentioned that you're looking for, I think you said, mid double-digit organic MA growth and I just wanted to \u2013 in balancing margins versus memberships, so can you just \u2013 can you provide a little more color on that? Where are you I guess in the MA margin cycle versus where your targets are? How long does it take to get to your target margins? And then thinking about that double-digit MA membership growth, how long of an opportunity is that? Is that a couple year opportunity, multi-year opportunity, how do we think about those two things?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Kevin. Thank you for the question. In terms of our Medicare Advantage margin profile, we continue to be within our target margin range. And quite honestly, we even have some five Star plans in the marketplace that we're deploying that really is helping and allowing us to market year around.","In terms of how long it takes, a lot of it depends on if it's a new member or an existing member from another carrier in terms of the management opportunities, the medical management or various other cost of care type things that we might do to ensure that the quality scores are there. If it's a new member, it certainly is going to take into the second year in order to starting to achieve target margins. But if it's an existing member, we can get there much more quickly.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","The line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks. Good morning. Just a quick question. I know that you do not like to provide specific numbers around ACA-related risk adjusters. But last year, in the middle of the year, you did provide some helpful color on whether you're in a net receivable position or not and you also talked about the claims experience relative to your expectations. So, I guess, I was curious if you're able to provide some of that same color this year. Thanks.","Peter D. Haytaian - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of \u2013 you're correct that we really don't provide some level of specificity of the questions that we get asked. But in terms of the risk adjusters, we've got the information from CMS a few weeks ago as everyone else did. It was exactly line with our expectations. We clearly understand the marketplace and have projected out what we thought the final true-ups would be, and they were very, very much in line. We are a significant risk adjuster receiver with approximately $520 million that we're entitled to now and feel very good that we're going to get that cash with what came out of CMS last night.","In terms of the \u2013 and, of course, that's all based on 2017, which is significantly a larger footprint than we have in 2018. In 2018, we still expect to be a risk adjuster receiver, but when your footprint has been reduced by over 55%, obviously the magnitude and dynamics of that goes down significantly. But we're still very comfortable with our approach and think our strategy is playing out extremely well.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","It's the line of Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys. Good morning. We noted, at least versus our estimates, sort of a big beat in the Commercial and Specialty segment revenue and margin rate, but lower enrollment in risk and ASO. So I'm kind of curious to know whether you got better pricing for 2Q renewals or if there are maybe any other factors you'd call out that might drive a dynamic like that.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Well, thank you for the question, Steve. I mean, I'll go back to what I said and we've been a very disciplined pricer, so I don't think anything has changed in our approach. And then secondarily, we've been able to successfully bring through a number of buy-ups. So those two factors have really had an impact on I think our overall PMPM rates inside the market.","Next question, please.","Operator","Line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Was wondering if you just give us some more color on the enhanced sort of medical cost performance. It sounds like that's not an industry-wide or trend impact. It seems like that's a lot more Anthem company specific driven. So what exactly are you doing? Are there new protocols in place, are you being a little bit more restrictive on pretty often, and all that sort of stuff? And then if you could just give color on the Medicaid reductions? Are there specific states that are going through re-enrollment processes, or are you seeing bigger attrition in certain markets? Thanks.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Good question, Josh. Let me start and then I'll ask Felicia Norwood to comment on Medicaid a little bit. In terms of your question on what are we doing, we have an intense focus across the company on cost of care. And I would point to pretty much everything that you mentioned.","First and foremost, we do lead the industry in integrated care arrangements, so we have had a long history of incenting primary care, in particular in our local markets where we do have significant volume to basically help us manage that cost of care effectively. Secondarily, we do use AIM, in particular, to help us on radiology, oncology, all of those management of specialty services and they've done a very nice job helping us mitigate trend.","Third, we look \u2013 across our network, we have had an industry leading unit cost perspective, but we're also looking to ensure things like Enhanced Personal Health Care, which I've shared before. We've seen some strong results and that's not just from the programs, we also deploy staff in our local markets to help those practices more effectively manage and integrate.","And the last thing that I guess I will point to, actually two things. We have an integrated patient record and it ties to the whole health that I answered the question a little bit about on pharmacy, whereas we've been working on integrating pharmacy, behavioral, dental, vision, with an integrated patient record and I think that has helped. So, the combination of our deep market presence, we're able to deploy individuals into the marketplace and then our provider value-based arrangements are more impactful and that again goes to many of the \u2013 the reason why we don't feel we have to own primary care that we can actually drive this differential cost of care by putting those programs into the market.","With that, I'm going to ask Felicia to comment a little bit on the Medicaid enrollment.","Felicia F. Norwood - Anthem, Inc.","Thanks, Gail, and good morning, Josh. We are seeing, as Gail mentioned in her opening comments, a decrease in Medicaid enrollment, primarily due to a reduction in our TANF members because of an improving economy, and also the continued redetermination efforts that we're seeing in several states. We are also seeing some just general market share contraction in several markets as well.","But as we've mentioned, we certainly expect to end our Medicaid membership ahead at the end of the year as to where we are with respect to Q2. We've mentioned our partnership certainly with respect to Blue Cross of Minnesota adding about 375,000 lives, and as we look ahead, we're certainly very excited about the opportunity and encouraged about the Virginia Medicaid expansion, which will put in play over 400,000 Medicaid expansion lives from 1\/1\/2019.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","It's the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I had a question for John. I just wanted to come back to the days claims payable in the quarter. I think the explanation about the ACA footprint and the acquisitions really serve to address the sequential decline in days claims payable. But I'm not sure have much impact on the year-to-year.","So I'm just wondering, if you look at the year-to-year decline of 1.8 days, is that \u2013 most of that these operational improvements around claims processing that you'd attribute to that?","John E. Gallina - Anthem, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Gary. Thank you for the question. And some of the same explanations that I provided for the sequential decline are the exact same explanations for the year-over-year.","The days in claims payable is an interesting metric. It's sometimes a metric that's impacted just by the math of the calculation, while other times it's impacted by operational or business issues. And clearly, we have both going on in the second quarter here in 2018.","So I do want to just spend a moment on the timing of the America's 1st Choice acquisition and just how significant that is to the math of the calculation.","So we acquired America's 1st Choice in late February and had, in the first quarter, only just over 30 days of benefit expense. We had had the entire reserves associated with 135,000 Medicare Advantage lives in our quarter end reserves.","And then in the second quarter, it's 90 days of benefit expense, with a very consistent reserve level. So that in and of itself is a significant driver. It's also impacting year-over-year as well.","And then the operational improvements, things like, we continue to be very focused on systems consolidation. As people know, we're improving our EDI rates, we're improving our auto adjudication rates. We're being more efficient and effective. We believe that there will be additional SG&A saves in the future associated with this.","But all that provides faster throughput and then continues to lower the days in claims payable balance. So it's very operational, very strategic quite honestly in doing that.","But I guess at the end of everything, what I will say is that our reserves are calculated very consistent and very strong and very conservatively year-over-year.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","It's the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. It sounds like your interest in external growth in Medicare Advantage is slowing, so after doing those two deals. So I'm just curious, are you seeing any change in the M&A market for Medicare Advantage? Is there anything you're seeing out there? Or is this more of just wanting to kind of assimilate the two recent acquisitions you've made? Thanks.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you for the question. Actually we're quite opportunistic in terms of M&A in this space. And so I think it's more of a focus on where we think the growth can come from most immediately.","As things arise, we certainly are interested in those type of opportunities. But we think given what we have right now, our footprint, again, our strong Stars ratings, our strong quality, our strong medical cost management and I think very, very good benefit offerings, that we can grow and get deeper in those markets.","So we do believe that there's significant growth opportunities in the states where we already have a presence and then some geographic expansion in counties around there.","The other opportunity that we have that we haven't talked quite as much about is the opportunity in the dual-eligible population. So we have an opportunity actually to do well in that. We do sell all year as you heard across our industry-leading Medicaid platform as well as Medicare. So we see growth coming from that arena as well.","And then I would like to point to our Aspire acquisition, because I think that's a great example of the capability that helps us support the Medicare Advantage population, a leading capability that we think we can leverage.","So as you think about where our interests lie, we're quite opportunistic. And we are looking at capabilities that help support and drive cost of care and quality in those marketplaces.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","It's the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning. Gail, I'm wondering if the potential extension of the health insurer fee moratorium through 2020 would change any strategies? And if so, how soon could we see the impact of that? How might that change benefit design and product design strategies as early as 2019, if at all?","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Well, certainly having stability and certainty and understanding kind of what the marketplace \u2013 we're doing renewals for 2020 beginning obviously in February of 2019. So the sooner we have a good, clear picture of the cost structure and where the health insurers tax is going to be I think helps in terms of our pricing and passing that tax through.","In terms of benefit plan and design, affordability is a dominant issue for employers. It's something that we focus on very much. So obviously, not having to pass the health insurers tax provides for greater stability and greater affordability for employers. And we think that's important overall.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","It's the line of Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. I just wanted to see if the recent drug pricing blueprint and the activity we've seen from drug manufacturers has changed how you think about implementing IngenioRx at all? And if you think it improves the value proposition of having the integrated solution? Thanks.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Thank you for the question. Well, let me begin first and foremost that we are very focused on reducing net overall drug prices. I think that really is the goal. It's the goal of the industry and it's certainly our goal as we launch IngenioRx.","In terms of the value proposition that we've laid out, the $4 billion of gross savings with 20% falling to the bottom line, we are very confident in that, feel it's a prudent number and do not see that changing.","But again, we're very supportive of anything as we build this new generation, next-generation PBM of really getting to lowest net cost. And I think that's what's really important.","We're not building this based on a rebate model, but we are building it based on a net lowest cost value model. And again, we are very supportive, but we want to ensure that everything that gets implemented really does result in lower cost for consumers. And so that really is our focus with IngenioRx.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","At this time, we have no other questions. I'll now turn the conference back to company's management for closing comments.","Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.","Well, great. Thank you very much, and we're pleased that we were able to get through the questions. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. As we look ahead, Anthem remains focused on improving the quality and value of the health care solutions we bring to our members, while at the same time delivering on the commitments we make to our shareholders. I want to thank all of our Anthem associates for living our values each and every day as we endeavor to deliver on the promises that we make to our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Anthem and I look forward to speaking with you at future events.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference is available for replay after 11 AM Eastern Time today through August 8 at midnight.
