I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norris","Thanks very much, Becky, and welcome everyone to Capital One\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. If you want to access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One\u2019s website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there.","In addition to the press release and the financials, we\u2019ve included a presentation summarizing our fourth quarter 2014 results. With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Steve Crawford, Capital One\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Steve will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One\u2019s website, click on Investors then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One\u2019s financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today\u2019s discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials.","Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. For more information on these factors, please see the section entitled Forward-Looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our annual and quarterly reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Crawford. Steve?","Stephen Crawford","Thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll begin tonight with Slide 3. 2014 full year results reflect solid underlying performance across all of our businesses. Consistent with our expectations provided at the beginning of the year, 2014 pre-provision earnings were $10.1 billon. Net income grew 7% and earnings per share grew 10%. For the year, return on average tangible common equity was 15.8%. Our balance sheet remains strong with an ending common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.4%. And we reduced our common shares outstanding by 3%, reflecting our share buyback program that began in April.","For the fourth quarter Capital One earned $999 million, or $1.73 per share. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.68 per share. Pre-provision earnings of $2.5 billion were down $125 million from the third quarter as higher linked-quarter revenues were more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses, largely driven by seasonal and growth related cost and investments in our technology and regulatory agendas that we have highlighted for you over the past several quarters. Provision for credit losses increased on a linked-quarter basis as higher charge-offs were more than offset a smaller allowance build over the previous quarter.","As you can see on Slide 4, reported NIM increased 12 basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.81%. Average interest earning assets were up quarter-over-quarter, driven by growth across our segments. Turning to Slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 12.4%, which reflects current phase-in. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, we were at a 11.4% in the fourth quarter.","We reduced our net share count by 5 million shares in the quarter primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We expect to complete our previously announced $2.5 billion buyback program in the first quarter of 2015. We formerly entered parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches as of January 1, 2015 and we continue to estimate that our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was above our target of 8%. Regarding the LCR, as of year-end, we estimate that we are comfortably above the fully phased-in requirements for our consolidated company.","With that, let me turn it over to Rich.","Richard Fairbank","Thanks, Steve. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 7 with our Domestic Card business, which delivered another quarter of strong growth in results. Ending loans were up about 6% year-over-year. Growth from the linked-quarter was also about 6%, stronger than typical seasonal growth. Continuing momentum in new account originations and credit line increase programs drove loan growth in the quarter. Purchase volume on general purpose credit cards, which excludes private label credit cards that don\u2019t produce interchange revenue grew about 18% year-over-year.","Revenue margin for the quarter decreased modestly to about 17.3%, consistent with normal seasonality. Revenue dollars grew 5% year-over-year in line with average loan growth. As expected non-interest expenses increased significantly from the third quarter. Strong growth opportunities drove higher marketing and operating expense increased to support loan and account growth, as well as our continuing investments to be a digital leader and meet rising industry regulatory requirements.","Credit trends in the fourth quarter were inline with our expectations. Last quarter, we explained that the third quarter charge-off rate was unusually low. It was the seasonal low point for charge-off rate and also included the temporary benefit from better than expected delinquency rates in early 2014.","In the fourth quarter charge-off rate increased 56 basis points to 3.39% about half of the increase resulted from expected seasonality and about half from normalization of the temporary delinquency favorability. The fourth quarter delinquency rate increased inline with normal seasonal pattern. Our expectations for the charge-off rate have not changed. We continue to expect the quarterly domestic card charge-off rate throughout 2015 to be in the mid-to-high 3% range. We expect normal seasonal patterns throughout the year, including an increase in the charge-off rate in the first quarter.","In addition to seasonality, we continue to expect that loan growth will impact the charge-off rates. As new loan balances season, they put upward pressure on losses. While this impact on the charge-off rate will be modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond.","In addition to rising charge-offs, we expect loan growth to drive allowance additions. For the full year 2014, the biggest story in our domestic card results was the return to growth. Ending loans grew 6% and general purpose credit card purchase volume grew 16%. Revenues declined 5% driven by our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio excluding the revenue impact of the portfolio sale full year 2014 revenues reflect inline with average loans.","Non-interest expense declined 6% with lower operating expense partially offset by higher marketing. Lower operating expense resulted from tight cost management across the business. Lower acquisition related expenses taking out cost associated with the Best Buy portfolio and the absence of a non-recurring legal reserve that impacted 2013 expenses. Provision for credit losses improved modestly with lower charge-off rate offset by additions to the allowance. The rekindling of growth along with our continuing focus on delivering strong and resilient returns, enabled the domestic card business to post strong net income, while improving the quality of our franchise in 2014. Our card business remains well positioned.","Moving to Slide 8. The Consumer Banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans were up about 1% from both the linked-quarter and the prior year. Growth in auto loans continues to be offset by expected mortgage run-off. Auto originations increased about 25% year-over-year driven by strong auto sales and deepening relationships with our existing dealers.","Ending deposit balances were essentially flat compared to both the linked-quarter and the prior year. We\u2019ve had an abundance of deposits since the ING Direct acquisition, and we\u2019ve been allowing the least attractive deposits from Capital One\u2019s legacy direct bank to run-off. On a linked-quarter basis, Consumer Banking revenue was up 2%. Non-interest expense increased $89 million, or 9%, from the linked-quarter, driven mostly by auto loan growth infrastructure in digital investments and higher marketing. And provision for credit losses increased $24 million from the linked-quarter driven by expected seasonal trends in auto charge-offs.","For the full year 2014, revenues were down 3% driven by the impact of persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances, and margin compression in auto. Auto loan growth partially offset these negative revenue impacts. Full year non-interest expense was up 3% driven by auto loan growth and the change in the income statement geography of where we recognized auto repossession expenses. Full year provision for credit losses increased $47 million, or 7%, consistent with the gradual normalization of auto charge-offs and allowance builds for auto loan growth. ","Full year 2014 trends show that our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the phase of continuing industry headwinds while our auto business remains well positioned. We remain cautious and continue to closely monitor pricing, underwriting practices, used vehicle prices and other competitor and market factors.","Returns on new origination vintages are lower than returns in the overall auto loan portfolio but remain resilient and above hurdle. And in our retail deposit business, we expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low rate environment will continue to pressure returns even if rates rise in 2015.","As you can see on Slide 9, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. Strong loan growth continued in the quarter, although the pace of growth is slowing. Loan balances increased about 2% in the quarter and 13% year-over-year. Most of this growth is in specialized industry verticals in C&I lending and CRE.","Loan yield declined six basis points in the quarter and 59 basis points compared to the prior year, driven mostly by increased competition, lower tax equivalent yield and our choice to originate more variable rate loans. The declining trend in loan yield stabilized somewhat in the quarter.","Revenues increased 5% from the third quarter and about 2% from the prior year. Year-over-year, higher loan volumes have been largely offset by declining yield. Non-interest expenses were up 4% from the prior year and 9% from the third quarter as a result of growth in our portfolio and continuing infrastructure investments.","Provision for credit losses increased $23 million from the linked quarter to $32 million. Charge-offs, non-performing loans and criticized loans remained strong in the fourth quarter. The current levels of commercial credit results are exceptionally low and we continue to closely manage credit risk.","For the full year, ending loans grew 13% and average loans grew 17%. Revenues grew 6% as volume growth was partially offset by declining yield. Non-interest expense grew a 13% moderately lower than the growth in average loans.","Provision for credit losses increased $117 million from a negative $24 million to positive $93 million, driven entirely by the swing from allowance releases in 2013 to allowance builds in 2014.","Our Commercial Banking business is well positioned to navigate current market conditions. While following oil prices, they are likely a positive for our consumer businesses. We\u2019re closely monitoring and managing the potential impact of low oil prices on our $3.7 billion energy portfolio. And competition remains intense in the Commercial Banking business, pressuring margins and returns. It\u2019s likely that the pace of our commercial loan growth will be slower in 2015, but we expect our Commercial Banking business will continue to deliver solid results.","Pulling up, Commercial Banking is thriving at Capital One. The business has steadily and profitably grown to over $50 billion. We\u2019ve built deep industry specialties and established great relationships with our commercial customers.","I\u2019ll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 10. 2014 was a strong year for Capital One. As Steve mentioned, we delivered 2014 pre-provision earnings of about $10.1 billion. We posted strong earnings. We strengthened our balance sheet. We returned to growth in our card business and continued to prudently grow our auto and commercial business. We improved the quality of our franchise and we returned significant capital to our shareholders. We\u2019re poised to build on the momentum in 2015.","Our expectations for 2015 include the impacts of the investments we\u2019ve been discussing for several quarters. In our domestic card business, we see attractive marketing opportunities to drive future growth. Marketing efficiency, cost to acquire new accounts and the net present value of our marketing investments are strong. We\u2019ll continue to invest to drive and support growth in loans, deposits, and account relationships across our businesses.","We\u2019re making significant investments in our foundational infrastructure and capabilities to be a digital leader. Banking inherently is a digital product and digital will transform banking over time. Capital One is well positioned to succeed in the digital world with our heritages and innovative information based company. We\u2019re committed to deeply embedding digital in how we work, not merely faulting digital on to the side of our company.","We\u2019re also spending to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. We\u2019re enhancing our capabilities, infrastructure, and talent to deliver on the broad set of expanding regulatory requirements and meet increasing expectations for risk management and regulatory reporting. And we\u2019re continuously improving processes for capital and liquidity management, including CCAR and the new LCR.","Capital One is delivering attractive risk adjusted returns today and we expect that that will continue. We have the financial strength to invest in our future without compromising current financial results. Pulling all this together, in 2015, we expect growth in full year revenues driven by a growth in average loans. We expected full year marketing and operating expenses will both be higher in 2015 than they were in 2014.","Let me turn to our efficiency ratio, specifically our expectations for the full year 2015 efficiency ratio. In July, we are articulating an expected range of 53% to 54% excluding non-recurring items. We\u2019ve reaffirmed that range in October. Since then we\u2019ve experienced a sizable adverse change in interest rates. As a consequence, we now expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be between 53.5% and 54.5% excluding non-recurring items. This change in range has driven entirely by the movement in rates.","We don\u2019t take this change in expectations lightly, but we don\u2019t believe we should make long-term business decisions based on spot prices for interest rates. We continue to manage costs, very tightly across our businesses, while make our planned expenditures to drive growth, be a digital leader and continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. These expenditures are essential to our ability to deliver strong shareholder returns on a sustainable basis.","We also expect that efficiency ratio will vary perhaps significantly from quarter-to-quarter based on factors such as day count, the timing of growth and associated revenues, and the timing of investments throughout the year. Pulling up our strategic priority for 2015 have not changed and we remain focused on the levers to create value and sustain strong performance. We will continue to pursue growth opportunities in card, auto, retail banking and commercial banking. We will maintain our longstanding discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilient.","We will manage cost tightly, while we invest to grow, be a digital leader, and we continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements, and we will actively work to return capital to shareholders as capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver value to our investors.","And now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?","Jeff Norris","Thanks, Rich. We\u2019ll now start our Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts, who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session on the call, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call to answer them. Becky, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks. Rich, could you talk a little bit about the competitive environment both in the kind of branded business and in the retail card business, maybe - so one of your competitors announced a portfolio acquisition today. Are there any - I mean any things you could kind of discuss in that area?","Richard Fairbank","Yes, Moshe, the competitive environment in the card business, I would describe as - intense, but consistent and fairly rationale. Industry balances remain flat - I mean have been flat for quite a while. Now, we\u2019re seeing a little bit of growth. Of course, there have been some increases in marketing levels with respect to direct mail.","You can certainly feel in the reward segment in particular, especially in cash back products, a lot of competition and manifest itself in their version of teaser rates, which is early spend bonus offers. Long-term pricing in general has been stable in the segments that we compete in. And overall, well again, I think it is intense. I would describe this industry as pretty rationale and more, more stable than the other markets that we compete in most notably auto and commercial. You know that was a description of the branded card business.","The partnership business, which as you know, Moshe, is sort of a deal flow business. The - as one who\u2019s certainly been around the branded card business for more than a couple of decades, the most striking difference between these two businesses is the option nature of the partnerships. And that is the biggest factor that leads this business to have in my opinion on an apples to apple kind of basis, lower inherent returns, and the wildcard of the marketplace and the nature of sort of option prices that that exist in any point in time.","That the - there are a number of partnerships that are sort of \u201cup for grabs\u201d in the marketplace. I would stress that one of the characteristics of this business is the significant majority of all partnerships actually sort of stay with the incumbent, but they certainly, go nonetheless most go through the RFP process. So there is fair amount of activity in this base and I'm struck by how competitive that is and certainly we\u2019ve been to some auctions where people are stepping up and paying prices in excess of what we\u2019re comfortable with, but certainly I would describe that as a pretty intensely competitive. And one that we\u2019re going to stay very disciplined. That\u2019s great.","Moshe Orenbuch","Just as a quick follow-up of that Costco Canada launched a couple of weeks ago for you guys, anything you can tell us about it?","Richard Fairbank","Well, we were very happy to win the Costco partnership in Canada and this of course is as you know a premier retailer with an amazing customer base VAC partnership. I think it\u2019s off to a very good start, but that is very early days and the - but it\u2019s a manifestation of the strategy that we have in the partnership business, which is to try to focus more on the sort of the premier players in the marketplace and that is where of course there is more intense competition to win these partnerships, but one that I think the players are more focused on really using these partnership card relationships as a way to really drive value for customers and that line is up exactly with the value that we think we can add.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell","Good afternoon, just I notice there was an absence in PP&R guidance although you did suggest that revenues would be higher in 2015 marketing and operating expenses would be higher in 2015. Would you be able to provide us some PP&R guidance or does it sound that like the revenue increase would offset the increasing expenses and therefore you would end up with about $10 billion again in pre-provision net revenue, but with higher loan loss provisions.","Stephen Crawford","Yes, Matt thanks for the question. We didn\u2019t give you PP for specific reason. But what we did do is give you lot of the building blocks. First of all we\u2019ve said that basically revenues are going to be driven by growth in average loans. We\u2019ve obviously provided you an update on the efficiency ratio. And in addition, what we didn\u2019t do last year, but have done this year is give you a sense for where charge-offs are going in our biggest business was in card. So we really are trying to provide kind of the major building blocks. The primary unknown for us is the ultimate growth that we\u2019re going to experience in card, and that really contributes to almost every part of the income statement in an important way and it\u2019s why we\u2019re reticent to be as specific on a particular number as we were in prior years.","Matt Burnell","Fair enough. And then in terms of the U.S. bill business, you had - what appears to be stronger purchase volume in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis than many of the other domestic competitors. Although the interchange was a little bit, I guess, below our expectations. Is there some dynamic there that you can provide a little additional color on in terms of the growth in the spending, but somewhat lower growth in the interchange?","Stephen Crawford","Yes, Matt. First of all, I wanted to say that the net interchange metric can have quarter-to-quarter variability because it includes partnership contractual payments in international card. And we also periodically adjust our reward liabilities based on customer trends and redemption rates and things like that. But even beyond that variability and sort of - if you look past quarterly noise, the phenomenon you\u2019re talking about is real and that net interchange growth has generally lagged general purpose credit card interchange growth for Capital One, and we would expect this trend to continue.","Our rewards programs have been and they continue to be very successful with of course flagship products like QuikSilver card, the Venture card, the Spark card for small business. We\u2019re also building a long-term franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards to customers and in many ways consistent with the industry extending rewards products to some existing customers, who don\u2019t have rewards. And there is some near-term cannibalization when we do this, but it\u2019s all part of building a stronger, deeper customer franchise. But the net effective all of this including leading with great flagship products, all of this contributes to that delta that we think will continue although to be a lot of volatility in that between purchase volume growth and interchange growth.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Don Fandetti with Citi Group.","Don Fandetti","Yes, thanks. Rich, I wanted to follow-up on the comments about the loan growth and the potential variability. It seems like you have sort of a general sense of where things would be headed in terms of the market, you know market share is - is the variability may be private label. Can you just talk a little about where you could go from here you are feeling like the 6% number, you could have upside?","Richard Fairbank","I think I learned a quite long ago that that when you have growth opportunities, trying to predict the growth rate at least from capital - the way we do business at Capital One is just something that\u2019s not probably in anyone\u2019s interest because just to reflect on how we make our decisions. As you know we\u2019re a fanatical information based company and across all the segments and sub-segments we\u2019re in. We are reading the data that is coming back and readjusting constantly our choices and so on.","What you have seen from our commentary for a number of quarters now and this commentary even actually preceded when you started to see our growth numbers is that we believe we\u2019re well positioned to for - to grow in ways that are right down the power alley of Capital One and the product of having invested for years to have this competitive position and this opportunity. That said I\u2019ve been around the block enough to know that the market can change and most importantly competitive dynamics can change.","So, what we do is try to share with you a general sense of and hopefully you can feel that reflected in the comments, the general sense of - about the opportunity. And I say yet again now and it\u2019s been several quarters that I\u2019ve been saying it is, I think we see a nice growth opportunity in front of Capital One. I don\u2019t think we want to quantify this, but what we\u2019re going to do is cease the opportunity as we have it. And then when does have opportunity if they change then we change accordingly, but this is why comments like we\u2019re - marketing will be up and we think there are growth opportunities for next year that would be consistent. And in many ways my message and the feel is pretty similar to the message I\u2019ve been saying for a number of quarters now.","Don Fandetti","Thank you","Richard Fairbank","Next question please?","Operator","We'll go next to Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets.","Sameer Gokhale","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I was just curious in terms of the efficiency ratio, guidance. Again, if you could just clarify, have you assumed any sort of interest rate increase in the second half of 2015, I know other banks, some other banks have. So I was just curious about that. And then I had another follow on. Thank you.","Stephen Crawford","Yes. So, our interest rate forecast that we use is based on forward, so there are some modest increases in the second half that that we would have.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay, thank you. And then I was trying to think of the interplay between, say your consumer - and when I say consumer, I'm just thinking to catch you all in everything ex-commercial loans, but the efficiency ratio dynamics between your commercial lending activities of Commercial Banking versus Consumer Banking. I know many other regional banks have actually had significant pressure in terms of managing their efficiency ratio, primarily because of revenue pressures. And so I was curious from your standpoint, have you implemented any structural changes to try to bring the efficiency ratio down in the commercial bank? And how do you think of the interplay of commercial versus consumer? Are they moving in the right - in the same direction? Or one is offsetting the other? That would be helpful. Thank you.","Stephen Crawford","So Rich, I am sure you may want to add to this. I think the biggest thing that the industry has talked about with respect to the efficiency ratio is the rate environment. And how that impacts pretty much all of the businesses and I think you saw a lot of commentaries from a number of players that it would be difficult to improve their efficiency ratio if unless we had more of a normalization in the rate environment. And that plays out in the commercial and the consumer business probably more than it does in the card business.","Richard Fairbank","And then the other thing is that that effect efficiency ratio of course is what\u2019s happening on the cost side, the investment side. And if you think about the drivers of our commentary about efficiency ratio and cost at the margin, one is growth opportunities. We have been stepping up increasingly, sort of, in the card business to invest because we see particular opportunities there. On the commercial side if anything our growth opportunity is decelerating because of the choices that we\u2019re making in response to market conditions, but those are factors that we\u2019ll play out over time. The regulatory costs are pretty much all across the enterprise and that\u2019s going in only one direction and I\u2019d be pretty surprised if over the next few years there\u2019s any forces that would move those cost pressures in the opposite direction.","And finally, the investments in digital. And while digital is a big opportunity across consumer and commercial, certainly on a relative basis, I think, the revolution is going to be greater on the consumer side and it\u2019s literally going to transform all aspects of how banking is done, it\u2019s going to transform not only if people often think through the lens of the customer experience, but really the whole way - the way retail distribution works, the way operations, marketing, servicing and even something that\u2019s very, very core to how Capital One works, which is information-based strategies itself. So this is a big deal on the commercial side, its pretty much a revolutionary deal on the consumer side.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Bruce","Thank you, good evening. I guess I would - trying to maybe reconcile between some of the comments that you\u2019re making around auto and still what is a very strong origination business for Capital One. Can you just give us some understanding as to how you believe you\u2019re navigating what is increasingly a very intensely competitive part of the marketplace?","Richard Fairbank","So Ken, our - we\u2019ve been saying the same things for quite a while about the auto business and the sort of started with our comments for some for many of the years right after the great recession started raging, which is, we went into this kind of - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s exaggeration to call it sort of once in a lifetime kind of confluence of events that led the auto industry, both from the growth and from a kind of returns and credit point of view to be absolutely exceptional. And most of what we have seen happening since then is sort of a regression more toward normal if you will. And so, what\u2019s happened, I think, for Capital One and certainly for other players is with each passing quarter, the intensity of the commentary that people in the business make is increased.","But if we pull way up that we don\u2019t see things that are - would cause us to have great alarm about the business, but what we see is just on the pricing side increased pressure. Although, that stabilized when I look at prime and subprime that stabilized more recently, but frankly in the prime space at a below kind of cycle, little bit below cycle norms, so things are very a tight there. The subprime space it\u2019s been steadily declining a little bit stable of late.","On the underwriting side, the most noteworthy place that there has been any risk expansion has been in terms of and there\u2019s been significant growth of the over 72 month loans. But still things likes LTVs, which is probably the single most important variable, have remained certainly on the prime side stable and healthy on the sub-prime side moderately increasing, but well below sort of pre-recession levels.","So more the way I would characterize this auto business, is that we just have to stay very, very vigilant and what I find is we - our choice is sort of one dealer and one deal at a time end up with the growth moderating in sub-prime for example sub-prime has been flat at Capital One, I think for in originations for about I\u2019m guessing since 2011, I think it\u2019s been pretty flat, so that essentially all of the growth in origination has been on - near prime and especially the prime side.","So I think that\u2019s a manifestation of our reaction to the marketplace and continuing to pursue opportunity where it is prudent and where we can build deeper dealer relationships. But I would say the important thing I want to link with you is while even new originations you can see have pound-for-pound kind of a bit higher credit risks than some of the exceptional stuff of the past. The business that we are originating, we still feel is well above hurdle and we like the opportunity.","Ken Bruce","Okay and just a follow-up, in terms of your guidance on credit card charge offs it seems that really what you\u2019re seeing is that just the seasoning of that some of the recent growth is going to have an upward bias on the loss rates that you\u2019re not really witnessing deterioration in terms of the underlying portfolio.","Richard Fairbank","Absolutely, absolutely. Well, let me just talk a little about the credit situation in the card business. First of all, it feels to us as pretty much exactly the same as when we talked about this a quarter ago. But just to put this in perspective, card credit has been exceptionally strong over the past few years. And our portfolio has benefited from the improving economy and a generally more disciplined consumer. And our back book which is made up mostly of customers who weathered the great recession. That continues to show exceptionally low risk and is very resilient.","We see great opportunities for resilient in new business, but from the starting point of our highly seasoned back book most new business will have higher losses. So the credit performance of our new originations and our credit line increases has been strong and in fact it\u2019s meeting in well - it\u2019s is meeting and some cases even exceeding our expectations in a good way.","And since we returned the growth I\u2019ve been emphasizing that these new loan balances season, they will start putting upward pressure on cards overall charge-off rate and this impact is going to be modest at first, but we expect it to grow through 2015 and beyond. And we\u2019ve been growing in the segments, we\u2019ve always been focused on, we continue to avoid the segments that we think lack resilients, even if they have quite nice returns in today\u2019s environment.","And that is really the essence of our credit story and we wanted to make sure that people exactly understand what is the dynamic that is leading charge-offs to increase. But back to the original question that you asked, this is not driven by a worsening of credit performance of the existing book or anything like this, it\u2019s really the by-product of our ceasing of growth opportunity and sort of the vintage math of that.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. I guess, the question on the revenue margin assumptions for 2015, I guess implicit in your revenues are going to grow with average loans is flattish revenue margin is that a fair statement?","Stephen Crawford","Talking about card?","Sanjay Sakhrani","A consolidated.","Stephen Crawford","Yes, plus or minus I think that\u2019s right. We\u2019ve got card obviously is a big contributor of the run-off of home loans is a positive on the other side. We\u2019ve talked for a while about compression in auto and commercial and the biggest kind of unknown is what happens for the rate environment overall. So you put those on the mix master our best guess right now is relatively stable.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And then a second question following-up, Rich, you mentioned kind of the impact of lower fuel prices on consumer, I mean how do you factor that into your guidance for next year as charge-up. I mean, does that marginally benefit that ratio? And then just - I\u2019m sorry, one quick data point question, Steve, if you could help out of tax rate for 2015? Thank you.","Richard Fairbank","So, let me do this the easier one first, our tax rate will be, if you look at the tax rate for the year, our best guess is, it will be plus or minus to the tax rate that we experienced for the year in 2014.","Richard Fairbank","Sanjay, I can only just to speak intuitively about the gasoline price impact obviously as we kind of hard to measure at this point. One reason it\u2019s hard to see is of course the sharpest drops in gas prices have been just over the past three months. And any credit benefit from falling gas prices is going to be really hard to disentangle from other economic effects. But it\u2019s just clear that falling gas prices translates into equivalent of a wage increased from most households.","I do want to caution though that the flip side is the same low gas prices may be economic stress and geographics that are heavily depended on the economic, I assume on the energy sectors so we\u2019ll have to keep that in mind. But just intuitively I think you have a pretty good net positive for consumers overall. We are not putting any of that into our own projections but it\u2019s clearly something we are going to start to see if we can measure it. But most likely I think it\u2019s going to be embedded in an overall economic performance.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Rich Shane with JPMorgan.","Rich Shane","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is a little bit assertoric, but I\u2019m curious if there was any change in policy related to funds transfer pricing at the consumer bank either in terms of rate that you will apply or balances?","Richard Fairbank","Short answer is no. My guess is the reason for the question as you are looking at the other part of our income statement and the change year-over-year and the biggest driver there was treasury, I mean there are other things in there as well, we\u2019ve corporate items that run through that tend to be lumpy but the biggest year-over-year change was treasury. And there were several reasons for the improvement in treasury in 2014 including change in rates, hedging actions we took in 2014 to manage the risk, rate risk in our balance sheet and improved securities yield because of slower run-off.","And to our couple of one time items in there too we had roughly $70 million of expenses for redeeming our preferred issuance in 2013 that we didn\u2019t in 2014. The one thing we did do a little bit along the lines of what you\u2019re talking about is with LCR coming on. We continue to refine the way that we charge our businesses for the liquidity that they use. So we were passing out more liquidity cost of the business, really consistent with things like LCR.","Rich Shane","Got it. Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Stephen Crawford","Yes.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Gugenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much and good evening. I\u2019m - Rich in the past, you\u2019ve highlighted some of the areas in which you are also seeking cost savings. I think vendor relationships is one that\u2019s been mentioned and I think there were few others. So I was wondering if you could just update us on the progress on those initiatives and whether all of that benefit gets reinvested or whether some of it gets manifested into earnings?","Richard Fairbank","Eric, there are a number of areas that we - well, first of all, across the board we\u2019ve been working incredibly hard on expenses for a long time. And this is of course in the context of headwinds that that are pushing things so hard in the other direction. And you can see over the - starting it well the second half of 2012 and through 2013 and 2014. The trajectory of operating expense and of course some of that comes from deal related expenses that sort of automatically happened. We\u2019ve also worked hard to make sure that we get the synergies we talked about and the deals and drive out the integration costs and things like that.","Also though other big areas of focus have been the area of procurement and we always sort of worked hard at that, but by building a big centralized and almost the whole science of that in making it have the feel almost like a line of business has been something that\u2019s even exceeded our own expectations. And we pretty rigorously measure not just, what talking to ourselves about how things are better, but really a before and after of kind of thing. And that that has led to some tangible - I mean, pretty sizable, tangible benefits. Another area that of course should generate increasing benefit is in digitization.","So a lot of the impacts of digital are really sort of hard to measure and it really relates to the way we work, but things like going paperless, driving people away from some of the more expensive channels into the digital channels and some of the transformation in terms of marketing to be more online and so on. These have facts that that we measure and they - the numbers are starting to grow. The on digital - just take digital itself that is a net trade that has costs a lot higher than benefits at the moment, in terms of what you can purely measure because we\u2019re investing heavily in digital and all of our in - there is almost nothing that we\u2019re investing in digital where the primary objective is to save money.","This digital transformation is such a comprehensive revolution. It really allows for things to be faster and way better for the customer, a better associate experience, much better controlled from a compliance point of view, more scalable and yes, lower cost. So right now, one of the important net negative trades is what's happening on just the pure cost side with respect to digital. By the way, the overall economic benefits of digital, I would argue that an important reason that we\u2019re on the growth trajectory, we\u2019re on in the card business is in fact because of our digital success not only in terms of the customer experience, but really in things like how we do marketing and things like that.","So this will - I believe the long-term pay off of the digital investment is going to be very significant. In the near-term from the cost line, this is going to be a negative trade. And, of course, the investment in the regulatory thing is a very substantial and of course we know which direction those things are moving. And the other thing, on the cost side, of course, is the investment in growth itself. And there the biggest number is of course marketing, but there\u2019re also operating cost that that go along with that as well.","And as you know Eric that\u2019s our highest priority for our own expenditures, is to make sure that we\u2019re investing in our own growth and those investments will continue. So net-net one minus all of that needs to be just, there\u2019s kind of a fanatical multi-year quest to bring out every single penny that we can and all of that is and that\u2019s out in this number that I am sure some people look at and say well, with all the growth and all the digital somehow shouldn\u2019t that be lower.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hi, good evening, guys. Just first on the card reserve, this is second to your core, I think, provisions did come in a bit higher than some of us were sort of expecting and just given your outlook from mid-to-high three [ph] U.S. card charge-offs, how should we think about the reserve on top of charges? Steve is there a target of 13 months forward how do we think about the right level that you guys manage the reserve to.","Stephen Crawford","So I\u2019d go back to what Rich was talking about on credit, because that\u2019s really the driver of our reserve and it\u2019s not as simple, nor would ever be as simple, we take 13 months of anything. It\u2019s actually looking at loss content in our portfolio. And there are two things that are really going on, one is the growth that we\u2019ve talked about and unless you assume growth as zero losses adding growth will drive up need for allowance.","The second piece of it is a little bit of the mix movement that Rich talked about from an incredibly low and resilient back book to a very much expected but higher loss front book. And as that becomes more of the equation that is going to drive up the loss content, which ultimately is reflected in allowance.","It\u2019s not a matter of not wanting to be helpful to actually give you a sense as to where allowance would end up. We have to accurately forecast 24 moths of losses and 12 months of balances and that\u2019s better than frankly anybody has been able to do and we think we are pretty good at looking how credit evolved. So we\u2019re not trying to do difficult that just out beyond particularly your delinquency low rates. I think it\u2019s very hard to predict credit from a quarter-to-quarter basis.","So in general, one can think a little bit about how the balances are growing as being the first factor and a trend rate in losses being a second factor, but even that\u2019s not enough, because our balance growth quarter-to-quarter has a seasonal component, right. So the fourth quarter uptick that you see isn\u2019t necessarily going to last throughout the entire year. So we\u2019re actually trying to figure out, which of those components are going to be more lasting.","So there\u2019s a whole bunch of things going in there, but I think you can see since we expect growth going up, since we\u2019ve talked about losses going up, there\u2019s going to be more need for allowance going forward.","Ryan Nash","Got it, and Steve, Rich talked a lot about the digitization. Can you size for us, how big these costs are and over what timeframe and we\u2019ve seen a lot of other banks try to self-fund a lot of these investments and to what extent do you think you can self-fund these? And I guess just related to the near-term, can you at least commit to PP&R growth in 2015?","Stephen Crawford","Well, look I think we said we expect to grow revenue and we expect our efficiency ratio basically to be flat to a little bit down on a GAAP basis. So I withdraw conclusion from that that we expect PP&R to grow. We\u2019ll leave it more up to you as to buy how much. We\u2019re not going to go through and kind of evaluate how much of the spend is digital. I think we\u2019re trying to do a whole bunch of things here, deliver very good returns in the near-term, but also make sure we can do that for the next 20 years. And as we try and set our priorities, it\u2019s kind of cognizant of both factors. And so far we think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job in managing that and plan on continuing to going forward.","Richard Fairbank","Let me just add to that that I want to go back to a comment I made before and some other banks may feel differently about this, but I think it may also manifest what we\u2019re trying to achieve here. I think in the long run, there is going to be very significant cost benefit from all these digital investment. But the biggest benefits and the reason we\u2019re doing it is in almost all cases not for that reason.","And what I most excited about is actually the opportunities to generate growth and to generate better real time decision making to make better credit decisions. And in the end build a deeper franchise through very significant improvements in the customer experience and things that really create more loyalty and more stickiness with customers. And so over the years, it will be very, very hard for us to measure that because digital and digital - I mean, digital investments are turning - are more and more turning us into a digital company as opposed to a company that just tries to digitize what they do or the phrase I said earlier to bold digital on the side of a bank.","So it\u2019s more and more becoming - over, over a longer period of time, who we are in terms of how we operate and how we make decisions and how information is used in the company. And if you notice my passion about this is because I have not seen and probably this speaks for mankind as well over, over our long history. But certainly, I haven\u2019t seen anything remotely like this in terms of the ability to transform how a business works. The only parallel is the thing that led me to go out and build Capital One in the first place, was looking at how information and technology we\u2019re going to transform starting with the card business and ultimately banking.","This is going to be a very, very big change and I think its biggest impacts will not be the impacts that they have on cost. But what is also clear is that for anything as transformational as this, one has to on a sustainable basis invest to build the foundational capabilities upon which the sort of digital innovation that the world can see will occur. And this is going to be a longer journey, but I think it\u2019s ultimately as significant to transformation as what the information based opportunity we saw 27 years ago turned out to be.","Ryan Nash","And just one last thing, one another hesitation with separating out these expenses is the overlap between our expenses, so things that one considers to be digital that also have enormous regulatory impact or enormous growth impact is pretty considerable. So the three things we\u2019ve talked about that are growing, causing a growth and an investment kind of overlap in a lot of ways.","Richard Fairbank","The pretty much number one way to make sure that that we\u2019re successful with respect to the breadth taking number of compliance requirements is in fact automation. Just trying hard and making sure we\u2019re well organized, just doesn't cut it with the magnitude of what\u2019s going on. So it\u2019s just another aspect of the breadth and depth to which investment in digital can really put a company in a very good position.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.","Chris Donat","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on the issue of the provision as we look forward given that there has been a lot of changes in consumer behavior and timeliness of payment. I\u2019m just wondering if the assumption that that new originations for card loans will have their peak charge-off in say 18 month to 30 month. Is that based on what we\u2019re seeing sort of post crisis, or is that really based on what you have experienced over the history of the credit card business? I\u2019m just wondering if anything is there that might be different this time around.","Stephen Crawford","Okay, well. First of all there\u2019s few different phenomena that are going on. When we talk about our charge-off, especially in the second half of next year and into 2016 going up as a result of growth that is the comp positive fact of all the different vintages have actions that are being taken. And I want to separate out a couple of different effects. One is originations and one is credit line increases. These themselves have quite different dynamics, they also have quite different flow in terms of many other metrics including the timing of profitability, and cost in the near term, and so on. But anyway with respect to credit, I would characterize credit line increases tend to write when they happen, they have a benefit with respect to losses and then overtime the charge-offs on a more delayed basis build overtime.","Originations tend to, they have a momentary kind of benefit from the speed boat effect that they have, but then they tend to peak earlier and then actually improve over the longer-term. And again our credit guidance is just a sort of comp positive all the different things that are going on. We have sizable credit line increased activity, we have very significant origination activity that\u2019s been going on over the past year and we hope will continue. And the most important thing, we have wanted to do is just make sure that as we started signaling sometime ago, the charge-off math of this very good development for Capital One is pretty predictable and we want to just make sure we got in front of that. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.","Chris Donat","Okay. So no real change in either from the originations or the credit line increases in consumer behavior kind of pre-crisis versus post-crisis, right?.","Stephen Crawford","Not, not well, so not in terms of the shapes of these curves. The consumer behavior pre-crisis was tended to lead to what turned out to be higher losses and a lot of things back then that was not nearly as cautious the consumer is now. So just about anything we do these days versus an equivalent action in 2006 or 2007 Certainly we would expect peak in a better place, but this is - and but the main thing as we were also saying is that paradoxically even as we are guiding to higher credit losses and frankly guiding to more growth in credit losses and it appears that our competitors are, this is in the context of a very stable and good credit environment. It\u2019s in the context of originations that are coming in very much as expected and consistent with what we\u2019ve seen recently and one that is really therefore entirely. Just the result of charge-off math associated with the acceleration of growth and then frankly going strikingly from a shrinking situation into one of some pretty good growth.","Chris Donat","Got it. Thanks very much.","Richard Fairbank","Thanks you.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","Our final question this evening comes from Brian Foran [Autonomous Research].","Brian Foran","Hi, I guess the only thing I left was on the rep and warranty reserves. I guess any color on the 1.1 billion going to 700 million, was there settlement and should we expect originally reasonably possible losses and that kind of stuff to come down in tandem?","Stephen Crawford","Well the reasonable possible losses left away to the 10-K, but yes I mean it was settlement activity that we\u2019re the primary driver of the reduction in the reserve.","Brian Foran","Great, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","Thanks Brian.","Stephen Crawford","Okay, well, with that I\u2019ll just say thanks to everyone for joining us on the conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One and remember the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norris","Thanks very much, Laurine. And welcome everyone to Capital One\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One\u2019s website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there.","In addition to the press release and the financials, we\u2019ve included a presentation summarizing our third quarter 2014 results. With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Steve Crawford, Capital One\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Steve will walk you through the presentation.","To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One\u2019s website, click on Investors, and click on Quarterly Earnings Release. Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One\u2019s financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today\u2019s discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials.","Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Steve?","Stephen S. Crawford","","Thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $1.1 billion or $1.86 per share in the third quarter. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.94 per share and had a return on average tangible common equity of 15.7%. Included in continuing operations results this quarter were higher linked-quarter revenue, flat linked-quarter non-interest expenses, higher provision for loan losses driven by $214 million allowance build, partially offset by lower charge-offs.","There were a few non-recurring legal reserve changes in the quarter, I would like to highlight. First, a $27 million contra revenue impact; second, we had charges in non-interest expense, which were offset by a $28 million benefit in our domestic card business. And last, we had a $70 million charge from rep and warranty expense and discontinued operations.","Turning to Slide 4, net interest margin increased 14 basis points in the third quarter to 6.69%, primarily driven by a higher average balances in our domestic card business and the third quarter having one more day worth of recognized income. Average interest earning assets were up quarter-over-quarter driven by higher average loan balances in our domestic card, auto finance, and commercial banking businesses.","Turning to Slide 5, let me cover capital trends. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized fully phased-in basis was 11.8% in the third quarter, compared to 11.6% in the second quarter of this year. With the benefit of phase-in our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.7%. And while we have yet to enter parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches, we continue to estimate we are above our target of 8%.","We reduced our net share count by 3 million shares in the quarter, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We completed approximately 500 million of our share buyback program in the third quarter, and we expect to buy an additional 1 billion over the next two quarters.","Let me close the night with a brief update of our 2014 expectations. We continue to expect pre-provision earnings to be about $10 billion, excluding non-recurring items. Traditionally, our marketing expenses were seasonally higher in the fourth quarter. That seasonal increase in marketing as well as our operating expense investments in growth, which Rich will review in more detail will drive an increase in non-interest expense in the fourth quarter of this year, which will carry into 2015. We highlighted for you last quarter that allowance releases were less likely going forward. In the third quarter, we build allowances as we grew our card loans and expectations for future card growth will likely drive allowance build in the coming quarters.","With that let me turning the call over to Rich.","Richard D. Fairbank","Thanks, Steve. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 7 with our domestic card business, which delivered another quarter of strong results. Ending loans were up about 5% year-over-year and about 3% from the linked-quarter, stronger than typical seasonal growth in the third quarter. Continuing momentum and new account originations and credit line increase programs drove loan growth in the quarter. Purchase volume on general purpose credit cards, which excludes private label cards that don\u2019t produce interchange revenue grew 17.5% year-over-year.","Revenue margin for the quarter increased 34 basis points to about 17.4%, consistent with normal seasonality. Revenue dollars grew about 6% from the linked-quarter, driven by growth in average loans and the seasonal increase in revenue margin. Year-over-year, revenue dollars were down about 4% as the revenue impact of our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio was partially offset by strong underlying growth in average loans.","Non-interest expenses increased $17 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher marketing expense. We expect both operating expenses and marketing to increase in the fourth quarter; driven by loan growth, the expected seasonal ramp in marketing and continuing opportunities, we see to drove customer relationships, purchase volume, and loans. Domestic charge-off rate improved 69 basis points on a sequential quarter basis to 2.83%. We believe the sharp improvement in the quarter is temporary. The third quarter is usually the seasonal low point for card losses, but we think seasonality drove only about half of the improvement that we saw in the quarter.","Most of the remaining improvement was the result of better than seasonal delinquency rates we experienced in the first half of the year flowing through the charge-offs in the quarter. We\u2019ve already seen this short-term delinquency benefit reverse itself. We think the 2.83% charge-off rate is an unsustainable low point, and that losses are headed up from here. In the short-term, we expect normal seasonal increases in the charge-off rate in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2015. Beyond seasonality, the temporary delinquency benefit I just described has run its course which will add to the upward trend in the charge-off rate in the fourth quarter.","Longer term, loan growth will start to impact the charge-off rate in 2015. As new loan balances season, they will start putting upward pressure on losses. While the impact on the charge-off rate will be modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond. Pulling together both the short-term and long-term factors including seasonal variability, we expect the quarterly domestic charge-off rates throughout 2015 to be in the mid-to-high 3% range.","In addition to rising charge-offs, we expect allowance additions resulting from loan growth. We aren\u2019t counting on further economic improvement helping our credit loss nor are we projecting renewed economic weakness. Of course, changes in a still tenuous economic recovery could substantially impact our current loss expectations. Our current business remains well positioned. Loans, purchase volumes, and revenues are growing, and we are delivering strong and resilient returns.","Moving to Slide 8. The consumer banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans were flat compared to the linked-quarter and declined modestly from the prior year. Growth in auto loans continues to be offset by expected mortgage run-off.","Auto originations increased 14% year-over-year. Most of the growth came from prime originations as we continue to capture additional prime share from our existing dealers. On a linked-quarter basis, auto originations were essentially flat.","Ending deposit balances declined by about $1.5 billion or 1% in the quarter. Year-over-year deposit balances declined about $800 million. We\u2019ve had an abundance of deposits since the ING Direct acquisition, and we\u2019ve been allowing the least attractive deposits from Capital One\u2019s legacy direct bank to run-off.","Consumer banking revenue was flat compared to the second quarter. Year-over-year revenue declined by $61 million or 4% driven by the impact of persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances, and margin compression in auto. Auto loan growth partially offset these negative revenue impacts.","Non-interest expense increased $29 million or 3% from the prior year. The increase resulted from growth in auto loans as well as a change in the geography of where we recognized auto repossession expenses, which are now included in operating expense rather than in net charge-offs.","Provision for credit losses increased $55 million from the linked-quarter driven by expected seasonal trends in auto charge-off. Home loans credit trends remain favorable and continue to perform well inside the assumptions we made when we acquired the mortgage portfolios.","Our consumer banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the phase of continuing challenges. While we expect that auto returns will continue to be resilient and well above hurdle, we expect that they will continue to decline as we move from exceptional levels to more cycle average performance. And in our retail deposit business, we expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low rate environment will continue to pressure returns even if rates rise in 2015.","As you can see on Slide 9, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. Loan balances increased about 3% in the quarter and 17% year-over-year. Most of this growth is in specialized industry verticals in C&I lending and CRE.","Loan yields declined 11 basis points in the quarter and 48 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by increased competition and our choice to originate more variable rate loans. Revenues increased 3% from the second quarter and about 10% from the prior year. The year-over-year increase was the result of growth in loan and deposit balances across the franchise, offset by declining loan yields. The stronger increase in non-interest income was driven by the Beech Street acquisition and growth of fee generating business.","Non-interest expenses were up 18% from the prior year as a result of growth including the Beech Street acquisition and continuing infrastructure investments to drive future growth. In the quarter, non-interest expense was flat. We continue to closely manage credit risk. Charge-offs, non-performing loans and criticized loans all improved in the quarter and remain at exceptionally low levels. While commercial credit results remain very strong, the current levels are not sustainable through the cycle.","Commercial Banking competition continues to increase pressuring margins and returns. As competition continues to increase, it\u2019s likely that the pace of our commercial loan growth will be slower in 2015 and closer to overall industry growth rate. But we expect our focus in specialized approach will continue to deliver strong returns in the commercial bank.","I\u2019ll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 10. We posted another quarter of solid results for the company and across our businesses and we continue to return capital to our shareholders as we execute our announced $2.5 billion share repurchase program. As Steve mentioned, we are on track to deliver 2014 pre-provision earnings of about $10 billion. We expect growth in full year revenues in 2015 driven by strong growth in average loans. While the efficiency ratio will vary from quarter-to-quarter, we expect the full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be between 53% and 54% excluding non-recurring items.","Our expectations for both the remainder of 2014 and 2015 include the impacts of investments to drive future growth to be a leader in digital banking and to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. Continuing opportunities to grow our domestic card business are expected to drive higher marketing expense in the fourth quarter and in 2015. Marketing efficiency, cost to acquire new accounts and the NPV of our marketing investments are strong.","We are also making significant investments in digital and technology, banking inherently is a digital product and digital will transform banking over time. The momentum around digital is building across financial services. Consumers increasingly expect elegant and robust digital experiences from all companies, including banks. Software is a predominant way consumers interact with their banks even today and that engagement will only go up. Activity in the payment space from financial services companies and non-banks is accelerating.","The ability to efficiently store and use vast amounts of data will unlock new opportunities. Capital One is well positioned to succeed in a digital world and we are investing in the foundational infrastructure and capabilities to be a digital leader. We are continuing to expand Capital One 360 as a national digital banking platform. We are bringing in significant native digital talent, engineers, product developers, designers and data scientists. We are very active in mobile and in payment. For example we are one of only a handful of banks, included in Apples launch of Apple pay in September and shortly thereafter launched our Capital One digital wallet.","We are focused on delivering an exceptional user experience to our customers and recently acquired a leading design firm in San Francisco called Adaptive Path. While the financial cost was modest, Adaptive Path has been a pioneer in the UX field and they will make a big impact on our customer experience. Also, Capital One has a deep heritage as an information based company and Big Data is tailor made for us. We are investing in our Big Data infrastructure to enable rapid psycho analysis in the generation of even more powerful insights and new services.","As we are reminded of almost daily in the media, there are significant threats to information security across all industries, including financial services. At Capital One, protecting customer information is paramount and requires that we are ever vigilant in our defenses. We\u2019ve made significant investments in this area over the years and we will continue to invest aggressively. Ultimately, the winners in banking will have the capability of world-class software company.","Most of the leverage and most of our investment is in building the foundational underpinnings and talent model of a great digital company. To succeed in a digital world, the company can\u2019t just boast digital capabilities onto the side of an analog business. At Capital One, we\u2019re embedding technology, data and software development deeply into our business model and how we work. For example we\u2019re focused on building reusable plug and play middleware using restful APIs, modern software development and design, integrating our platforms and making them scalable in real time and building a powerful and flexible data infrastructure.","These foundational investments while not only the most visible are glamorous aspect of our digital journey create sustainable competitive advantages and position us to continue to thrive as banking goes even more digital. We\u2019re also investing to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. We are enhancing our capabilities, infrastructure and talent to meet heightened expectations for risk management and regulatory reporting. We are continuously improving processes for capital and liquidity management including CCAR and the new LCR requirements, and we\u2019re investing to deliver on the broad set of emerging regulatory requirements.","The expectations for large financial institutions continue to rise and we\u2019ll continue to invest to keep pace with these requirements. Pulling up Capital One is delivering attractive risk adjusted returns today and we expect that will continue. We have the financial strength to invest in our future without comprising current financial results. We remain focused on the leverage that create and sustain high performance.","We\u2019ll continue to pursue growth opportunities in card, auto and commercial banking. We\u2019ll maintain our long standing discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilient, and we will actively work to return capital to shareholders, as capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver value to our investors.","Now, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We\u2019ll now start our Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any further follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Lauren, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe Bruyette & Woods","Good evening. First question just on your expectations for charge-offs, I appreciate the color, is it fair to assume the ramp in the reserves was kind of related to that as well as the growth and maybe you could just remind us of the methodology you use to determine reserve adequacy? And I guess second question, I\u2019ll ask upfront just the growth in the balances, it\u2019s pretty encouraging, what are you seeing that\u2019s different from maybe a year ago that\u2019s driving that growth in balances in card? Thank you.","Stephen S. Crawford","","I\u2019ll take the first. I think Rich will take the second. You are spot on in your observation about what drives the allowances, it\u2019s really two factors, loan growth which we\u2019ve been talking about returning in the second half for a while and then also the higher delinquencies which translates into higher NACO likely in the future.","And basically, we have an extremely low quarter of NACO this quarter. As Rich talked about, we expect that to normalize and that replacement effect also has an impact on allowances. So going forward, you should absolutely be focused on loan growth and then to the extent that you believe delinquencies in acres are headed up, and that\u2019s going to have an impact on allowance and obviously if you thought the opposite, the opposite would be true, but it\u2019s really both factors.","Richard D. Fairbank","And Sanjay, what we\u2019re seeing is continuation of what I\u2019ve been talking about for \u2013 in a sense, talking about what we\u2019re working on for a number of years, and talking about the traction the last several quarters, the traction that we\u2019re getting, it is really in both originations and in line increases. In originations, we in the areas that we have really chosen to focus on including the top of the market with the heavy spender segment and in revolvers other than high balance revolvers.","We have seen really growing traction in those areas, and that\u2019s a good thing to see. The other big effect is line increases. Line increase is something that is always a central part of how we manage our business. As you know, we were kind of experienced sort of a line increased brown-out, starting really in some sense back in the throes of the great recession. We\u2019re very conservative and then of course we had the Card Act and the rules associated with proof of income before we could do line increases.","So in some sense, what you see now is moving from a browned-out line increase situation through now where we\u2019re back into equilibrium in doing that and also catching up with some deferred line increases along the way. So there is a lot of strength in both areas, and I think we\u2019re encouraged not only by the traction, but by the prospects for continuing traction.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, a couple of follow ups. One is just on the ALLR ratio itself. I guess your point that expecting NCOs to come back up, are you using a forward look of I would say 12 months, 18 months, and I also just wanted to understand if \u2013 how you are assessing what ratio to get that ALLR up to today?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, it\u2019s actually different, Betsy, based on product, but the big driver is card and card, and the most important timeframe is the next 12 months, so it\u2019s really the view of what\u2019s going to happen to loss rate over the next 12 months, it\u2019s going to be the principal driver. In addition to that, you\u2019ve also got to factor in what the growth will be.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good evening. Steve, when you think about the 53% to 54% efficiency ratio for 2015, can you give us a sense of what type of PP&R would be associated with that. I know you noted, Rich noted that you expect growth in revenues for the coming year, but Rich also gave a long list of things that you needed to invest in, so I guess if we do continue to see balance sheet growth at the pace that we are seeing, can you just help us understand what might be a good base level for us to anchor to, thanks.","Stephen S. Crawford","Yes. So I think Rich did a couple of things, he reconfirmed at 53% to 54%. He also said we expect loan growth to really drive the revenue outlook. So, I think we\u2019ll leave it up to you to really figure out what you think a reasonable rate of loan growth is, and that\u2019s probably as far as we are prepared to go in 2015 in terms of forecasting PP&R.","Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then if I could ask one follow-up question, Rich, you talked a lot about digital investments, Steve spoke about opportunities to make a business more efficient in the past. I know you guys are talking about a 53% to 54% next year, which is essentially flat on a core basis. But as we look out over the next few years, do you think there is enough leverage in the investments that you are making now that we should see continued efficiency improvement over time?","Richard D. Fairbank","Ryan, I think that digital, there are many benefits to digital investment. I would \u2013 the economics ultimately of going digital are pretty dramatic. The marginal cost of a digital interaction is virtually zero, and we are far from that in the analog activities that we do. A couple of things I want to say about that, first of all, I don\u2019t even think the biggest benefit or the most compelling case for digital is just to lower costs even though I do believe that that is the end game.","This is one of those few things in life where it\u2019s pretty much everything gets better, but we are talking about being able to be faster, more efficient, a better customer experience, better controlled in an intense regulatory environment, much more able to innovate a better associate experience, so there is a lot of things that come on this journey.","From an economic point of view, we have tracked digital investment, and also the clear savings that come from that, most importantly from driving customers to digital. Just because you build it, they don\u2019t necessarily come. So we have a lot of efforts on that and we are making a lot of progress.","That said, the tally right now for the measurable parts is we\u2019re spending more than the manifest savings are, and I think actually that differential will continue because there is a lot to invest in, but it\u2019s very clear to me that we can see savings and we can see a lot of other benefits happening. But the thing I want to leave with you is this is not a program, this is not a project, this is not a one year kind of thing. I mean we\u2019re essentially talking about \u2013 we happen to be living through probably one of the biggest revolutions in the history of the world up there with possibly fire at [will] (ph).","So that said, I think there\u2019s a lot of transformation to go on in banking. And so, I think that the impacted digital investment will put upward pressure on efficiency ratios as opposed to downward in the near and medium-term. Longer run its direction is clearly downward, but I just wanted to leave you with that.","Jeff Norris","","Next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Ken Bruce of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good evening. I guess I would like to delve into what you\u2019re seeing within the portfolio or just generally that\u2019s leaving you to believe that that delinquencies are heading higher teens, just looking at some of trust data that you see a little bit of a seasonal effect, but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something specific that you\u2019re kind of focused on or what\u2019s kind of leaving you to believe that we\u2019re going to pass the best in delinquencies?","Richard D. Fairbank","","Well, so, let me separate out sort of the comments I often make about where we are in the cycle versus things related to Capital One and the strategies that we have. I don\u2019t have a changed point of view about where we are in the cycle. We\u2019re in an extraordinary time. It\u2019s hard to imagine. As an industry loss is getting much better than this. I\u2019ve been wrong before that over the last few years. It\u2019s really quite extraordinary where we have come to. But this is not. When we\u2019re talking about delinquencies and charge-offs going up, this is not calling a turn in a sense of \u2013 finally the credit card industry has gotten beyond its lowest point. At some point that\u2019s going to happen.","What we have going on here is much more \u2013 is partly just mechanics that we want to share with you and then most importantly, it\u2019s the growth story. The mechanics are that we had an unusually low third quarter. And so, coming back often unusually low third quarter is part of the math that we want to make sure that everybody understands. And within that of course you have the seasonal effects, but also we\u2019ve seen \u2013 in our history we watch very, very carefully for changes in flow rates that we see across the business.","There was a particularly positive good surge in flow rates in the first half of this year that just looking at the mechanics of that, that has sort of reversed itself not into something bad but more of a just kind of reversing of that particular surge. That\u2019s one effect that kind of going on here. But as we look forward, so first of all we\u2019re reversing out of the unusual momentarily low of this quarter. And then you pretty much from there you\u2019re looking at seasonality and we\u2019re heading into the seasonal ramping part of the year. And then you have the growth, the dynamics of growth taking over from there.","So this isn\u2019t really about the charge, the credit card industry, it\u2019s really about Capital One and the effect of the very positive story that we see developing in terms of our growth, but we want to make sure people understand that what comes with that territory is increasing losses, particularly compared with our environment of not much growth and even shrinking over the last few years, and we want to make sure investors just understand the charge-off math associated with that.","Kenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And everybody is focused on credit card growth, it seems that the success that you\u2019ve all had is being kind of looked at by others jealously and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve seen any change in the competitive landscape based on others behavior?","Richard D. Fairbank","So I think the competitive landscape in card continues to be intense, but strikingly stable. And again I would compare that you\u2019ve often heard me talk about, I think both the commercial business and the auto business are getting kind of into a degrading state of competition and as they regret towards the main and so on. I think that so, but the card business, the pricing is relatively stable, you\u2019ve had mail volumes increase by about 16% over the last year and so we got to keep an eye on that. And by the way that mail volumes increasing in the context of where the world is increasingly going to digital so that the total amount of marketing is even greater than kind of what you see in mail volumes.","So certainly there\u2019s more \u2013 there\u2019s competitive intensity there, but I think the real thing that\u2019s going on is there\u2019s \u2013 the surviving and successful players in the card business have looked back in their rear view mirror as they\u2019re tripped through the great recession. And they have figured out where they\u2019re good and where they\u2019re not so good, and they have staked out in most cases strikingly different strategies.","And I think each of those strategies makes a lot of sense for the particular issuer and it\u2019s playing to the strength of the particular issuer, but I think it helps to contribute to a rationale competitive environment in which in its own way we can kind of all succeed. And one thing kind of helping us a little bit after all of these years of the card industry and total growth growing nowhere you have seen in the last few months just looking at revolving credit date I think inching up from near zero to in March 1.5%, April 2.6%, May 2.5%, June 2.9%, July 3.4%, August 3.3%.","So it\u2019s a little bit of rising of the tide as well. So these alleged jealous competitors, I think, are feeling very good about how they\u2019re doing in, it\u2019s a pretty stable industry. Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","Thank you. Good evening. There is a kind of focus on auto and \u2013 so I had a couple of questions that I\u2019ll ask upfront. Rich, can you give some perspectives around how the auto business at Capital One has transformed from its early years to where it is today and the extent to which during that time there has been a remixing the way from what was then maybe a bit more of a focus on sub-prime customers to perhaps a bit more of a focus on prime today?","And just kind of bring us to where your mix of prime versus sub-prime is currently? And maybe you talk about the relative attractiveness of each of those segments in the current market? And then finally maybe just doesn\u2019t necessarily have to follow that the risk of loss is greater in sub-prime given collateral quality and to the extent to which used car prices still remain pretty strong? I know there is a lot there, but I would appreciate any color on that. Thank you.","Richard D. Fairbank","And you say as the risk of loss greater in sub-prime, greater than \u2013 what greater than it was before greater than prime, what did you\u2026","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","Yes, I mean, I guess you\u2019d maybe just talk about like risk adjusted margins and how they have changed in both prime and sub-prime and how collateral plays into that?","Richard D. Fairbank","Okay, thank you, Bill. So, Capital One, in 1998 we entered the auto finance business with the belief that this highly fragmented industry was going to go national and we wanted to bring information based strategies and the national kind of strategy to that business and we bought a sub-prime credit card company, Summit Acceptance Corporation. So our initial foundation came out of the sub-prime side and over the decade and a half that we\u2019ve been doing it since we have migrated to a pretty much full credit spectrum perspective.","This is not only to leverage scale economies, but what\u2019s very clear is that the real leverage is in deep dealer relationships and there is economic benefit in that and I think in terms of the quality, the kind of loans that come out of that, it\u2019s a win-win to build deep dealer relationships. And also it is our nature. If you look across the businesses that we do, that we tend to try to play across the credit spectrum and tend not to specialize just in one particular place.","So this has been a long journey over this period of time, but you can see the continuing move toward not only near-prime, but so much growth in prime. And I think \u2013 and most of this is a matter of solidifying and deepening the exiting dealer relationships that we already have. So I think it\u2019s a win-win as we do that.","Now when you think about the economics of the business, sub-prime has high margins and higher losses and it\u2019s all about how well one can play the credit risk management game. And I think this is not for the faint of heart. This is companies that deeply invest in that and we have 15 years experience in auto and couple of decades experience in the card business and underwriting in that particular segment and we feel very good about the risk adjusted through cycle returns that we experience there. And I think our rearview mirror experience in the Great Recession is confirmatory as well","Near-prime by the way is just in between everything that I\u2019m going to say about prime and sub-prime. On the prime side, this is very thin margins and very low credit losses and that is a business that where scale matters and every expense dollar is really important and so on. But I think we\u2019ve managed to build one of the top positions in that business. And while the returns are much lower we are comfortable with those returns. They\u2019re much lower than sub-prime. We\u2019re comfortable with the returns and we\u2019re very comfortable with the integrated economics we\u2019re getting in this business.","Just one comment about the cycle for a second. The extraordinary returns a few years ago in the auto business as competition headed for the hills, have now pretty much regressed very close to the mean. Some prime remains a little bit above in terms of returns at this point and the prime business is really right there at the intense point in the cycle from a margin point of view. But overall things here we feel good.","Stephen S. Crawford","","Also look for additional information on the mix of our auto portfolio in our upcoming 10-Q.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Don Fandetti with Citigroup.","Donald James Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Yes. Rich, I have some question around Apple Pay. It seems like the banks may be paying some type of fee to Apple. Obviously, you can\u2019t talk about the specifics. I was curious if you can offset that outside of fraudulent. Secondarily, I know the networks are creating a vault and charging the banks. And there\u2019s been some talks that the banks might create a vault. I was wondering if you consider that as well.","Richard D. Fairbank","","Okay. Don, we don\u2019t get into the economics of our contract with Apple. But the decisions that we make come with the belief that this is an important thing for us to do. And I think it offers a good, opportunity and upside for us. The vault that that bill is referring to let me just comment for a second, one of the key elements in security, that\u2019s a very important breakthrough is that, card numbers are not going to be embedded inside the secured element on a phone. Instead, one-time single-use or a few times use tokens will be in a sense, sent to the phone. So that the risk of extended fraud is massively reduced.","Visa and MasterCard are creating a vault and there is other activity that\u2019s going on of some alternative approaches, as well just in the nature of an evolving industry. I think people aren\u2019t leaving single solutions as the only way to go. But whether it is coming from Visa and MasterCard or from a banking industry vaults are really actually from individual issuers vault. There\u2019s work going on in all three of those dimensions, but the big story there is, this tokenization is a game changer in terms of security.","Donald James Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Thank you.","Jeff Norris","","Next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert Napoli \u2013 William Blair & Company","","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just on the credit card business, Rich, I mean your growth just over the last few months has just really accelerated and it is there \u2013 are we getting to high single-digit growth or double-digit growth in the credit card business or is it just \u2013 this is just kind of a one-time catch up in bringing the credit lines \u2013 kind of catching up with the increases in credit lines that you had delayed for several years? Pretty stark increase in loan growth from 0% to 5% in the last three or four months.","","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, it\u2019s funny given the heritage of the company that we would think numbers like this are\u2026","Robert Napoli \u2013 William Blair & Company","Right, go ahead.","Richard D. Fairbank","Are so big, but all jokes aside of course we did live through the period where not only where we \u2013 so you had \u2013 we\u2019re going from an environment where we had a very cautious consumer and we ourselves had a certain challenges that we had to deal with that I talked about earlier. And then we also had sort of the running off of some of the HSBC highest risk things and then our multi-year is still going on avoidance and running off of high balance revolver.","So that\u2019s a lot of things that sort of conspired to generate some anemic and frankly negative numbers in terms of our growth. And what\u2019s going on here Bob is not really a kind of one-time effect, on the line increases there is a bit of a \u2013 there is some element of kind of catch up with that, but I would more leave you with \u2013 this is really the product of the steady work we done from a number of years both in the line increase innovation side and on originating in the segments, we know so well. It\u2019s actually continued traction there. You know as well enough to know that we\u2019re not going to make a forecast of growth, but you can also tell that that we feel pretty good about the traction we have right now and we do look forward to seeing continued growth.","","Robert Napoli \u2013 William Blair & Company","Then last question is just on the commercial business, you\u2019ve had very good growth there, but loan yields \u2013 well credit is phenomenal, your yield has dropped almost 50 basis points and deposit costs are relatively flat year-over-year, and you talked about very intense competition. But how does \u2013 where do the loan yields flattened out here, does the growth really slow down because it\u2019s too competitive. Can you really generate the returns you\u2019re looking for with the trends that I\u2019m looking at?","","Richard D. Fairbank","Well, look at \u2013 I think that the nature \u2013 let me comment for a second about the nature of how I think credit cycles work. When you\u2019re in the sort of good part of the credit cycle, which has been like the last few years where borrowers are more careful and lenders are more careful and maybe a little more scarce, as you go on in the cycle, I think there is a very kind of classic pattern that occurs that as competition increases, lenders, particularly those who have strong memories of a recent recession like we all do here, what happens is the competition becomes almost singularly focused on price.","And I think that prices fall until you get kind of down to that point where there\u2019s not a lot of room there. And then you kind of move to phase two in the industries \u2013 in the cycle evolution where people start compromising various underwriting terms. I think most of the \u2013 I describe commercial that this battle has been played out on the pricing side, but also there is certainly other things going on the C&I side.","The impact of the CLO market and the covenant light loans has put a lot of pressure on sort of the lower end of the marketplace, but it\u2019s not impacting banks that much at this point, but we have a wary eye on that. I mean, just the percentage of loans in the institutional market that are covenant light is substantially higher than before the great recession. So we certainly have to keep an eye on this. And in other areas, individual areas you start to see some loosening of some underwriting standards in the industry, but I think all in all if the things aren\u2019t too in a bad place yet.","The key thing we\u2019re doing is focusing on segments where we are comfortable with the segments and for us that\u2019s mostly the specialty lending segments that are not as subject to 8,000 banks who are looking for assets, trying to go out and see if they can generate business. This is kind of like the card business where highly sophisticated limited number of players, who know what they are doing are competing in these spaces. So the net effect of all of that is I\u2019m going to leave you with. I mean, we still feel that there is good business to be had in commercial, but you should be thanking as this regresses to the main our growth is going to do the same.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","","We will take Chris Donat with Sandra O\u2019Neil.","Christopher R. Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners, L.P.","","Hi, good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask about the marketing spend in the third quarter, which typically at least in the last few years has been down from the second quarter, but it\u2019s uptick this year. I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s reflective of opportunities you\u2019re seeing that are then translating into new account growth, or is it more tied to other campaigns, or something like Quicksilver. Just little explanation about where we are in the third quarter also with your comments of expecting an increase in the fourth quarter.","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, so it\u2019s a very natural thing for everybody, when they think marketing to think of TV ads, because that\u2019s what you all see unless you\u2019re blessed by having your mail box full of some of our solicitations, and so on. I want to say that just as a reminder, the amount of money we spend on television advertising is a modest portion of the entire expenditures that we do in marketing.","So my short answer is that a lot \u2013 there you\u2019ve seen the seasonality of marketing spend and a bunch of that comes from campaign seasonality. So things like our sponsorship of a lot of things in the NFL, I mean in college football and things like that, there\u2019s a whole seasonality there. Campaigns you see like Quick Silver and various things, there\u2019s a lot of hard wiring in advance of some of that stuff. But the increases that you see beyond the normal seasonality really are a reflection of real time seizing of the opportunity that\u2019s going on at Capital One, as we see growth opportunities.","So there\u2019s kind of a fixed component in the near term and there\u2019s a variable component. And we\u2019ve always said that in the end that variable component is pretty sizable, as well. And you\u2019re just seeing the manifestation of kind of seizing the moment and taking advantage of that","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll take Rick Shane with JP Morgan.","Richard Barry Shane \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","Thanks guys for taking my question. I actually want to circle back a little bit on the question upon Bob Napoli raised. When we look at margins, particularly in the card segment, when we strip out, sort of the impact of the HSBC portfolio and the run-off there, it actually looks like your margins have been pretty stable. Rich I know you\u2019ve given a lot of metrics, related to 2015 outlook, in terms of credit and expenses. And I don\u2019t want to push too hard in terms of getting you to give us one more. But give us a sense, I mean, do you think that we are \u2013 and again you guys have talked for a long time about margin erosion and then backed away from it. Do you think that we\u2019re at that inflection point now?","Richard D. Fairbank","You\u2019re talking, Rick, about the card business?","Richard Barry Shane \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","I am talking about the card business.","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes.","Richard Barry Shane \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","Yes.","Richard D. Fairbank","I don\u2019t see evidence that we are. I mean look, I\u2019m the last guy you\u2019ll ever see saying, read my lips, no price reductions from here kind of thing. But now I see people intensely competing in the segments where they see their strengths. All of them are sophisticated, they all have fresh memories from the great recession. And I \u2013 look, yes, we have been one that has been predicting margin decline for a number of years.","And so first of all, you probably shouldn\u2019t be asking me giving my credibility that has been lost over that subject, but I see again a very competitive but stable rational environment. And probably in the longer run, there will be pressure on that, but I don\u2019t. It sure has a different feel for me again than the other segments we play in, where things are only going in one direction.","Richard Barry Shane \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","Got it. Yes I mean, I think, if it is that \u2013 several years ago, you talked about margin compression following Card Act and eventually sort of threw your hands up and said, hey, we\u2019re not just seeing it, it feels that way still.","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, I mean, again, a lot of my predictions about the margin compression back in the post Card Act days, really was sort of thinking through the mechanics of all the aspects of the Card Act and how that would play out and some of that stuff. It didn\u2019t play out exactly as we had predicted. The other thing that\u2019s going on, I really want to draw another thing too into this conversation in both the commercial and the auto space, if I were to calibrate that compared with the card business. In the commercial and auto space, you literally had people heading for the hills for a whole period of time as the great recession was raging. A lot of auto players literally liked bailed out of the business.","You had a lot of particularly European players bail out of the business so much capital markets money, and so on leaving the commercial space. And so supply itself has really changed over this period of time and it\u2019s led to margins to really go up and then to really go down. In contrast, in the card business, all the players who pretty much entered the great recession are still the same list of players on the other side of it. We were all a little wiser now, but we\u2019re all very committed to the card business and pretty much doing all the things that continue to make it successful. So the card business never had the spike in margins that occurred in the other businesses nor does it have the kind \u2013 the regression to the mean therefore that occurred in the other businesses.","","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research","Hi, good evening. Can you hear me?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, Brain, go ahead.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research","","Okay. I guess I don\u2019t know want to \u2013 I know you said you don\u2019t want to give revenue guidance. I guess the question I have is you\u2019re being fairly explicit about expenses going up and we are at a $12 billion annualized run rate, so it feels like the current consensus is 12.3%, it feels like up is something more than that and you\u2019re still talking about a 53% to 54% efficiency ratio. Just to make those two die out, would revenue growth have to be in the high single-digits just to make the math work?","Richard D. Fairbank","No, Brain, if we\u2019d wanted to get that specific by line item we really would. There is a lot of moving pieces in the environment. We\u2019re trying to do a lot of the same things \u2013 a lot of things at the same time, keep our customers, our regulators, and our shareholders delighted and particularly in this interest rate environment that\u2019s a handful. So we feel comfortable with our guidance of 53% to 54%. We\u2019ve tried to give you senses as to what\u2019s going to drive the top-line growth next year, which is really loan growth. We just talked a little bit about how we feel about loan growth. I think given where we are that\u2019s probably as far as we\u2019re prepared to go.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research","Fair enough. Maybe a follow-up on a separate tack is marketplace lending or peer-to-peer whichever term you prefer I mean how do you think about it both as a competitive threat and as an opportunity for Capital One?","Richard D. Fairbank","We have a great interest in all of the innovations that are coming out of the digital space. I think one thing that is a classic thing that banks do and I always worried that we resemble that description is to focus on things the way that we do it and miss the fact that they\u2019re really break-through things going on. I think they are \u2013 so the peer-to-peer lending, which is pretty much non-exiting activity on the banking side is clearly picking up quite a bit of steam in the startups and in the digital space. I think there is a \u2013 it is our view that all of the opportunities in the digital space and we pretty obsessively study those including a bunch of lending ones.","The peer-to-peer lending opportunity is not one that\u2019s at the top of our list in terms of the opportunities. I mean we\u2019re going to be very close students of what\u2019s going on, but I think there are number of other really clever things that are happening with startups that we\u2019re a lot of more interested in. I think there is a \u2013 when you think about peer-to-peer lending and all the risk issues associated with that, all the regulatory environment we live in and kind of the things that we have learned and \u2013 that I personally, for example, have learned in over two decades of building a consumer lending company. There are a lot of challenges and a lot of risks in there. So what we\u2019re going to do is probably be a very eager observer and we\u2019ll go from there.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","Our final question this evening comes from that Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks for taking my question. A bigger picture question then a fairly focused one. Rich, given \u2013 all the commentary you gave us in terms of your focus on improving the digital offerings and at a time when a lot of the traditional commercial banks are spending a lot of time and effort on doing the same thing. Can you give us a sense as to your \u2013 the trend in your level of comfort and your ability to keep deposits and maintain deposit pricing relative to maybe where \u2013 how you were thinking about that a couple of years ago?","Richard D. Fairbank","","Are you talking about the asset liability, sensitivity or\u2026","Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","I guess I\u2019m really talking about deposit data, one of the questions we get most often from investors is Capital One spends a lot of time talking about their digital offerings and I think that in some cases gets investors worried about the potential for outflow of deposits faster at Capital One than at a \u201ctraditional bank\u201d even though those traditional banks are now following down the path of Capital One trying to focus on digital acquisition of deposits.","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes. So first of all, you know, so much \u2013 when I gave my little spit flying little passionate speech about digital a few minutes ago.","One thing I want to say is the way digital is transforming banking goes far beyond what I think the thing people mostly think about, which is, today there are branches and tomorrow there is a branch in people\u2019s pocket. And look that is very important component of that whole thing.","And by having bought ING Direct, by having before that already build to digital bank of our own, and having a big commitment to digital innovation and having a heritage of 20 some years being a direct marketing company, I\u2019m very interested in the opportunities there. But the bulk of our digital investment itself and capabilities is really for things that kind of extend beyond some of the narrowest view about just moving to a bank in your pocket kind of thing.","Let me comment on deposit stickiness. And I really appreciate that you asked the question. If the conventional wisdom out there is gosh well the only way that these, some of these online banks have got, they\u2019ve used price as a way to generate their business. Again having 10 years experienced ourselves in building an online direct bank and then having bought ING, we have a window that shows how very different that the actual world that we live in is, versus some of those perceptions. And a lot of it, and it really pivots around what is it that is drawing customers into a bank like ING Direct, for example, and now Capital One 360.","Many years ago at its very beginning ING offered one of the highest rates paid. And over the years it had a very explicit goal that we are going to move into building of franchise and building a brand, and the benefit of that is that we\u2019re going to get people to come for us for something other than just being number one in the league tables with respect to rate. And over time the ING franchise has, now Capital One 360 has moved way off the frontier of where the hot money goes.","And in fact, we now have well more than a decade of experience of just seeing how long live these customers are, and also how below this franchise is, the customer loyalty is really extraordinary. And so while I would say that relative to the branch on the corner we in our own planning are assuming a deposit data that is higher than those most sticky of deposits. I think that people are going to be pleasantly surprised by the resilience of these deposits.","You make the other point, which is really important to, which is that there is a blurring of the lines here over time as more and more banking becomes digital. And I think, especially with Capital One strategy ourselves to kind of create the fusion of the truly kind of ING oriented digital bank and the physical distribution Capital One that we are and I think that as our own lines blur also you\u2019re going to see the industry lines blur and I think that over time it is a franchise with surprising striking resilience.","Stephen S. Crawford","","And, Rich, just to add, extending that beyond just how online versus in-branch deposits respond, I think the way your whole liability mix responds to changes in environment is a much bigger question. It\u2019s a function of your wholesale, retail mix, what\u2019s ensured, what\u2019s not ensured, the size and duration of your deposit relationships. And as we look at that we don\u2019t feel disadvantaged relative to peers. And I think if you look at our asset sensitivity, you\u2019d find that lines up pretty closely with the average peer bank.","Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Thanks, Steve. And then a quick question for you perhaps. You mentioned the LCR requirement. How far long are you on that? And was the decline in the yield on investment securities this quarter versus the second quarter driven by some of the actions you\u2019ve taken over the three months?","Stephen S. Crawford","We have been rotating. There will probably be a little bit more, but that\u2019s not a big impact on margin. We\u2019re going to be fine in terms of meeting the transitional requirements. LCR isn\u2019t a huge issue for us except there is a little bit of a margin compression and obviously there is some OpEx getting our systems in a place where we\u2019ll be able to calculate all the stuff on a daily basis. It\u2019s a good example of the regulatory cost that Rich was mentioning.","Jeff Norris","","Well, thank you everyone for joining us on the call today.

To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our fourth quarter 2017 results.","With me this evening is Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Blackley, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Scott will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and the press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements.

And for more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our annual and quarterly reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Blackley. Scott?","Scott Blackley","Thanks, Jeff. Turning to slide three, I will cover results for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, Capital One posted a net loss of $971 million or a loss of $2.17 per share. Excluding adjusting items we earned a $1.62 per share in the fourth quarter and $7.74 for the full year of 2017.","Adjusting items in the quarter, which can be seen on slide 14 in the appendix of tonight's slide deck, included the following: $1.77 billion or $3.61 per share of tax expense related to the impacts of the tax act. $76 million or $0.10 per share of restructuring expenses largely related to the shutdown of our mortgage originations business. And $31 million or $0.07 per share from the build in our U.K. payment protection insurance customer refund reserve.","In addition to the adjusting items in the quarter, I\u2019d also like to highlight a few notable items that also impacted the quarter. $169 million or $0.22 per share of charges for a mortgage rep and warranty settlement which is included in our discontinued operations.","$113 million or $0.15 per share of charges related to our Commercial Taxi Medallion lending portfolio. Before I go into our results for the quarter, I\u2019d like to spend a minute on a few tax reform items which are highlighted on slide four.","The total net impact of tax reform on Q4 earnings was $1.8 billion of which the biggest piece was the DTA write-down reflecting the change in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.","For 2018, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 19% plus or minus. I\u2019ll caution that since tax reform was only recently passed there is still the potential for adjustments to all of our current tax related estimates.","Pre-provision GAAP earnings decreased 5% on a linked quarter basis. Provision for credit losses increased 5% on a linked quarter basis as a smaller allowance build compared to the third quarter was more than offset by higher charge-offs. We have provided an allowance roll-forward by business segment, which can be found on table 8 of our earnings supplement.","Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across our businesses. In our domestic Card business, we built $118 million of allowance in the quarter driven by seasonally adjusted growth and the effects of the small tail of growth math on credit losses in 2018. ","Allowance in our consumer banking segment increased $29 million in the quarter. The allowance in the quarter was driven by a planned accounting change to accelerate timing of charge-offs of repossessed vehicles which was partially offset by an allowance release as hurricane-related losses came in lower than our prior estimate.","Net reserves in our commercial banking segment were impacted by our move of a significant portion of our Taxi Medallion business to held for sale. We\u2019ve marked that portfolio to our estimate of a reasonable market clearing price and coupled with other Taxi related adjustments, this drove provision expense of $113 million in the quarter.","In the quarter we settled the mortgage rep and warranty litigation matter which drove a loss of $160 million -- $169 million in discontinued operations. With this settlement, we have closed all of the material active litigation from our legacy rep and warranty related exposures.","Turning to full year 2017 results, Capital One earned $4.1 billion or $7.74 per share on an adjusted basis. Adjusted pre-provision earnings of $13.4 billion were up 11% year-over-year as higher revenue more than offset higher non-interest expense.","Net income for 2017 on an adjusted basis was up 4% as higher pre-provision earnings more than offset higher provision for credit losses. Full year efficiency ratio was 51% excluding adjusting items down from 53% in 2016.","Turning to slide five, you can see that reported net interest margin was down 5% or five basis points from the third quarter primarily driven by lower domestic card yields from the full quarter impact of the Cabela\u2019s portfolio, as well as slightly higher rate paid on consumer deposits.","Net interest margin was up 18 basis points on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by higher mix of card assets on the balance sheet and the benefits from higher short-term interest rates.","Turning to slide six on common equity tier 1 capital ratio, on a Basel III Standardized basis was 10.3% which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.2%. We continue to believe that CET 1 under stress is our binding constraint.","After digesting the effects of tax reform and adjusting our capital plan, we believe our CET 1 ratio on a fully phased in basis will trend back towards the mid-10% range. Lastly, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve at the end of December, while we cannot comment on any aspect of our regulatory feedback we are committed to addressing the Federal Reserve\u2019s concern with our capital planning process.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rich. Rich?","Richard Fairbank","Thanks Scott. I\u2019ll begin on slide 10 with fourth quarter results for our domestic card business, which include a full quarter of impacts from the addition of the Cabela\u2019s portfolio. The run rate Cabela\u2019s impact on charge-off rate, delinquency rate and revenue margin played out as expected in the fourth quarter.","Ending loan balances were up $8.2 billion or about 8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding Cabela\u2019s, ending loans grew about 2%. Fourth-quarter purchase volume increased 15% from the prior year.","Excluding Cabela\u2019s, purchase volume increased about 8%. Revenue for the quarter increased 4% from the prior year; revenue margin for the quarter was 16%, down 73 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by the expected 65 basis point impact from Cabela\u2019s.","Non-interest expense increased 1% compared to the prior year quarter. The efficiency of our domestic card business continues to improve. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.08% and the 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 4.01%. Excluding Cabela\u2019s, the charge-off rate was 5.36% and the 30 plus delinquency rate was 4.18%.","The full year 2017 charge-off rate was 4.99%. Excluding Cabela\u2019s, the charge-off rate was 5.07%. In the second half of 2017 we\u2019ve seen the effects of growth math moderate and we continue to expect a small tail in 2018. As growth math runs its course, we expect that our delinquency and charge-off rate trends will be driven more by broader industry and economic factors.","Slide 11 summarizes fourth-quarter results for our consumer banking business. Ending loans grew about $2 billion or 3% compared to the prior year. Average loans were up $2.6 billion or 4%. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up $3.9 billion or 2% versus the prior year with a 12 basis point increase in deposit rate paid compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.","In the quarter, we exited the mortgage originations business. We determine that our originations business did not have sufficient scale to be competitive in a market where scale really matters. Scott discussed the adjusting item related to our exit, which runs through the other category.","While fourth-quarter auto originations were down 5% compared to the prior year quarter, the auto business continues to grow with Ending loans up 13% year-over-year. Competitive intensity in auto is increasing, but we still see attractive opportunities to grow. We remain cautious about used-car prices and our underwriting assumes that prices decline.","As the cycle plays out, we continue to expect the charge-off rate will increase gradually and loan growth will moderate. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter increased about 9% from the fourth quarter of last year driven by growth in auto loans as well as deposit spread and volumes.","Non-interest expense for the quarter decreased 3% compared to the prior year quarter driven by our ongoing efforts to tightly manage cost. Provision for credit losses was down from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily as the result of a smaller allowance build. Compared to the sequential quarter, provision for credit losses increased, driven by additions to the allowance that Scott discussed.","Moving to slide 12 I\u2019ll discuss our commercial banking business. Fourth quarter Ending loan balances decreased $2.3 billion or 3% year-over-year driven by our choice to streamline and pullback in several less attractive business segments, late year pay downs on agency multifamily loans and the write-down of Taxi Medallion loans.","Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 average loans increased 1% and revenue was up 2%. Non-interest expense was up 11% primarily as the result of technology investments foreclosed asset expense related to the Taxi portfolio and other business initiatives.","Provision for credit losses was $100 million up $34 million from the fourth quarter of last year. Scott already discussed the fourth-quarter impacts from the decision to move most of the Taxi Medallion portfolio to held for sale.","The charge-off rate for the quarter was 85 basis points. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 4.1% down 20 basis points from the third quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.4% down 80 basis points from the third quarter.","The ongoing recovery in oil and gas markets has improved the credit performance of our oil and gas business. We\u2019ve seen our E&P portfolio return to health but we continue to see credit pressure in oilfield services. We\u2019ve provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves and other metrics for the oil and gas portfolios on slide 17.","Capital One continued to post year-over-year growth in loans, deposits, revenues and pre-provision earnings. We continued to tightly manage cost even as we invest to grow and drive our digital transformation, and we continued to carefully manage risk across all our consumer and commercial banking businesses. We met our guidance for 2017 coming in at the high end of our domestic card charge-off rate guidance, the low-end of our total company efficiency ratio guidance and delivering 7.4% growth in EPS net of adjustments.","Our 2017 results put us in a strong position as we enter the New Year. Loan growth decelerated in 2017, but we still see opportunities to book attractive and resilient loans in our card, auto and commercial banking businesses. Marketing was down a bit in 2017. We expect marketing in 2018 will be higher than 2017.","On the credit front, the impact of growth math on our overall charge-off rate began to moderate in the second half of 2017, and we expect a small tail of growth math in 2018. As growth math runs its course, we expect that our domestic card charge-off rate trends will be driven more by broader industry and economic factors. Our efficiency ratio improved significantly in 2017. Over the long term, we continue to believe we will be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gain.","We expect the new tax law will also give us a significant boost. In the near term, we expect a majority of the tax benefits will fall to the bottom line. Why only a majority? I believe markets behave in predictable ways passing some of the benefit from companies to consumers and the economy.","A surge in tax benefits as a way of working its way into the marketplace through increasing competition including higher levels of marketing, lower prices and higher wages. Responding to these actions will likely consume some of the tax benefit in 2018, and these competitive effects will likely increase over time.","As all these effects play out, we will continue to lean into our long-standing investments in talent, technology, innovation and growth. We are bullish about the long-term benefits of our investments.","Taking all of this into account, we expect that our current trajectory, coupled with the new tax law will enable us to accelerate 2018 EPS growth net of adjustments and assuming no substantial adverse change in the broader economic or credit cycles.","Pulling up, in 2017 we advanced our quest to build an enduringly great franchise with the scale, brand, capabilities and infrastructure to succeed as the digital revolution transforms our industry and our society. We made strategic moves to position our businesses for long-term success. We continued to grow and serve customers with ingenuity and humanity.

","Now, Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.","Jeff Norris","Thank you Rich. We\u2019ll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, investor relations team will be available after the call. Leanne, please start the Q&A","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey good evening guys. Rich, maybe you could expand a little bit on the last comment regarding accelerating EPS. I guess, one, would that exclude the benefits of tax. And when I look back on 2017, you may 7.74 yet there was almost $0.50 of notable items, you had business exits like mortgage [indiscernible], so can you maybe discuss or give us a little bit more color on the components of the accelerating EPS? And I have one follow up.","Scott Blackley","Ryan, this is Scott. I\u2019m going to start and talk about the kind of some of the items that were in 2017. If you think about it, there\u2019s -- in this business we always have a few things that come and go. We make decisions about trade-offs along the way. So we feel like 7.74 is a good benchmark to start our guidance for 2018. Beyond that, I would just say that we call those items out as notable because I think they are important for you to understand kind of the trends but as I mentioned, I think there\u2019s trade-offs that we make along the way when we look at those kinds of things. Rich?","Richard Fairbank","So Ryan as you know, we typically do not give EPS guidance, and we are not giving a specific 2018 EPS forecast. In the prior quarter we told you that we expected solid EPS growth and then tax reform passed, which is clearly a good guy for EPS growth, although we expect the benefit to make its way into the marketplace over time. The timing of how that plays out is hard to predict. So all said, we expect that our current trajectory coupled with the new tax law will enable us to accelerate 2018 EPS growth net of adjustments, and assuming no substantial adverse change in the broader economic or credit cycles.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Maybe I could on a different point, so when I think about some of the comments that you made on credits, we have growth math fading, last quarter, there was mention of back book normalization, you have Cabela\u2019s plus the impact of tax reform should be positive. So we heard from another issuer that some of their recent vintages have been, have been getting better, so while I understand that you don\u2019t want to give credit guidance or for EPS guidance, can you maybe just talk about how you are thinking in terms of credit going forward, and that and I guess a small piece for Scott, you talked about a small piece from growth math and seasonal growth how should we think about reserves going forward? Thanks.","Scott Blackley","So yes, we\u2019ve said that in 2018 growth math still has a small upward tail. And then eventually it becomes actually a good guy in the long run. The earlier vintages of our front book, vintage 2014 and 2015 have stabilized and eventually they\u2019ll start coming down gradually as I mean that would be our expectation.","Now of course losses on the newer vintages of our front book 2016 and after which are earlier in their seasoning process are still increasing. So when we take the blend of all of that the risk of the overall front book is still increasing modestly in 2018. But we are getting pretty close to the point when maturation on earlier vintages of growth fully offsets the impact of newer growth and this is all again kind of what we call growth math.","Richard Fairbank","Ryan, just to come to your last question on reserves, from here going forward I think that the biggest drivers of what\u2019s going to impact the allowance as Rich said, really are the things that are going to be impacting our overall loss rate, which are broader industry events in trends, economic factors and the growth that we have during each period.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you, good evening. Maybe to approach Ryan questions a little bit differently. When we think about expenses in 2018, I think Rich you talked about the efficiency ratio and Scott that 51% and the fact that marketing might go higher, could you talk about how that efficiency ratio might trend through 2018 as you are reinvesting a little bit of the upside from tax?","Richard Fairbank","Well my primary comment about tax, the tax effect was how we think over time, and I\u2019ve seen if - I think there are some parallels that I\u2019ve seen in the past of how these things have a way of making their way into the marketplace. So again that one we\u2019ll have to see over time. With respect to the efficiency ratio, we\u2019ve been working so hard on this, and it\u2019s kind of a blend of what I might call old school and new school progress, old school being just the classic really work hard and drive every penny of savings, and new school of course really is leveraging the benefits of the extraordinary technology transformation that is literally going to change everything about how the industry works. It\u2019s certainly going to change everything about how Capital One works and change how the business works, how the customer interaction model works, and it will affect how we work, and the nature of our underlying operating model.","Now that takes many, many years. That\u2019s a continuous evolving process, but we\u2019ve seen 300 basis points over the last couple of years of benefits. And that that\u2019s a blend of the old school and new school kind of thing. We don\u2019t have any -- we are not making any specific guidance about 2018, and frankly efficiency ratio can vary in any given year. But I think over the long run, we continue to believe that we can achieve gradual efficiency improvements driven by growth and the many types of productivity gains that come from technology transformation.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And maybe on credit quality just specifically when we think about where the opportunities might arise going forward I mean is there a greater opportunity go a little bit more downmarket as a result of some of the tax benefits in terms of profitability. I mean, can that impact credit quality as we look ahead. And then just to clarify on Taxi Medallion, I mean should we expect, that that portfolio will be sold and there wouldn\u2019t be any major impacts going forward?","Scott Blackley","Yes, why don\u2019t I start with the Taxi Medallion? So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we put the majority of that book in held for sale. That means that I\u2019ve got an expectation that we are going to be able to sell that within a reasonable period of time. We marked it at a price that we thought was a reasonable estimate of where that would clear the market. So while we\u2019ll have to see where that settles out we feel pretty good that we\u2019ve put that risk principally behind us, and that we won\u2019t be talking about that any further. But again, that\u2019s a portfolio that at this point it\u2019s going to be carried at the lower cost to market. And so if we did see any adjustments, we would make those along the way.","Richard Fairbank","With respect to the tax reform, the impact on the U.S. consumer and maybe specifically the subprime consumer, I\u2019ll give you just a few thoughts on that. I think, it\u2019s hard to predict how this will play out. If likely there will be positive effects, both to the consumer and to the broader economy. While there is some direct benefits to the consumer, I think with respect to this particular tax reform the primary benefits of this are indirect, and they are going to play out over time, and in many ways it\u2019s a little bit a flip side of the same coin of what I was saying with respect to what happens to the tax windfall relative the company, and I believe firmly that it\u2019s just overtime makes its way into the marketplace in for in terms of more competition, lower pricing, higher wages, more investment and these things do have an impact on consumers.","Now with respect to the subprime consumer, it\u2019s possible that this might have a stronger impact. More subprime borrowers struggle with day-to-day expenses and modest increases in wages, and take-home pay will likely have a somewhat differential impact. But I think we shouldn\u2019t exaggerate this impact because many subprime book borrowers are doing well in the current economy with relatively solid incomes. So we are not baking any impacts into our outlooks for subprime credit although we are certainly hopeful that tax reforms will have a benefit.","I do want to put a cautionary note relative to the credit opportunity and that is because my primary point about tax reform and trying to predict how it plays out is one of predicting competitive effects and the way things move into the marketplace.","I think the biggest driver, I mean, other than very big changes in the economy, the biggest driver of our appetite to grow credit and particularly in this segment is really driven by the supply and demand \u2013 the supply and demand that we see in the credit marketplace. And if we look back to the -- I think there's an interesting lesson. I myself want to go off -- go back and dusted off a little bit from the 2005 bankruptcy reform.","The 2005 bankruptcy reform created somewhat of a windfall in the marketplace. And what in that period of time now of course there were lot of factors going on. But we saw that windfall make its way into the marketplace in the form of more up marketing, more aggressive pricing and frankly in that particular case also, and again there are other things going on, more aggressive underwriting. And so, at the end of the day the competitive intensity became problematic.","So, I think \u2013 so we\u2019re going to have to see how this thing plays out, but we are not putting into our credit forecasts or really our business growth forecast, the direct impact of this because we\u2019re going to watch as it plays out. But if I pull up, I'm hopeful that we can find similar growth opportunities in the near-term by overall how the marketplace appears to us and one factor would be this one.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","Hi, Rich. If you look at the December domestic card delinquencies on a year-to-year basis, they actually improved a little bit again in December. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that trending? And then, I think in the past on the charge-off rate in card you sort of have called it out when you expect it move. So is no news, good news meaning that maybe you could come hang out around this sort of five -- low 5% range?","Richard Fairbank","So, Don, I think that our domestic card charge-off rate increased on a month-over-month basis by 21 basis points between November and December. And that's kind of in line with what we would expect from normal seasonality. Now when things come in just consistent with seasonality, that's a good thing because there is also other effects, growth math and things going on, so we certainly saw that as a good month. On a year-over-year basis the increase in our December losses was a few basis points more than December, I mean, more the November, excuse me, but the underlying trend of moderating year-over-year increases is clear. So it\u2019s another month of performance that's consistent with our own expectations of how growth math works. But with every month that plays out we like the confirmation of that and so we view it as a good thing. But I again noticed our guidance about a small tail of growth math etcetera. Our commentary on this is really unchanged from the last quarter and frankly several quarters, but this is certainly playing out consistent with how we would've expected.","Don Fandetti","Got it. We were sort of looking ex Cabela's on the delinquencies, but quickly on the auto delinquencies, it looks like they were up a good bit year-over-year? Was there some type of one-time adjustment?","Richard Fairbank","Yes. On auto nonperforming loan side there was an impact of -- we made an accounting adjustment to include some of the repossessed assets as loans, we move those at other, that\u2019s impacting that. I don't think that I can recall anything otherwise that would impact DQs particularly in the quarter.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Richard Fairbank","Sorry, I think our own view of the data we see over the -- the monthly data we've seen this quarter is consistent with our view that we've been talking about that, I think the auto business is really performing quite well from -- and probably the industry right at this moment performing quite well. From a credit point of view, we worry about the things that the risk that are out there like used car prices in particular and possibly a increase in competitive activity, but for right now my observation is the auto marketplace is in a pretty good place competitively.","The competitive intensity steps up a bit in the fourth quarter which is why our origination volume was down off the kind of unusually high levels of a year ago where the competition had backed off quite a bit. But I think we're still seeing generally performance that\u2019s consistent with the middle of the cycle and something that confirms our own confidence and happiness about our own choices and are performance.","Jeff Norris","Now, next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good evening. How are you?","Richard Fairbank","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Two questions. One just on the growth math, how much growth math do you think was in this quarter versus the prior quarter, I\u2019m just trying to understand if we saw some deceleration already that you\u2019re looking for?","Richard Fairbank","We are seeing deceleration, but my point is not so much a \u2013 well, I mean, yes, we've seen it in the second half. We saw the deceleration in the third quarter. I'm speaking of our growth math itself and that's the impact on the year-over-year loss rate driven by our front book. So, we saw deceleration in the third quarter and again on the fourth quarter. So, I mean, every quarter there\u2019s small effect, but it's all part of the natural phenomenon here and I think that's why we expect a small tail in 2018.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just the follow-up on the use of the tax benefit, you are in a position where you could have pretty important impact on your earnings if you ratchet up the marketing. And I get your point that in prior periods when you had one-time changes, there was lot of heavy competition that might not have had a long tail benefit to it, but we're in a different spot now with the pretty permanent decline in the tax rate.","So, I\u2019m just wondering if you think that -- given that more permanent tax rate change doesn't make us to wait and see what others do or take a leader position in trying to get that incremental customer in the door with a stepped-up marketing program? Why wait to see what the competitors do?","Richard Fairbank","Well, Betsy, I think that we have a hypothesis about how this thing plays out over time. I think we already carried into -- on Capital One we carry an investment agenda that we believe very much in and that we will continue to invest in. I think we feel pretty good about the growth opportunities that are there. We\u2019re going to take advantage of them. But I think we are going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to continue doing the kind of things that we've been doing. And my primary point -- my kind of two points about the tax law is, one, we\u2019re reluctant to give guidance to investors about how much this is going to drop to the bottom line because I think it will have a way over time to make its way into the marketplace. And of course we\u2019re going to need to respond to that.","And my other point is that, I think there will be impacts that it has on the consumer and I think in the near term particularly some of those may be good, but I think what -- we already feel pretty good about our growth opportunities. Marketing is going to be a little up over last year and we\u2019re going to just watch very carefully how this plays out. I'm struck by others who say -- who are so confident about what percent of the tax impact is going to fall to the bottom line because I don't feel that we have that particular ability to predict this because I think it's the marketplace thing.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Brendler with Buckingham.","Chris Brendler","Hi. Thanks. Good evening. I just like to talk about the domestic card for a second, growth ex Cabela's has slowed down to low single digits, it\u2019s obviously a competitive market but you're still out there with this pretty aggressive marketing on both the Quicksilver and Venture products. Is that something that you expected to rebound in 2018? Or is just a new normal? Thanks.","Scott Blackley","Well, I think you've seen our purchase volume metrics there and purchase volume growth continues to be pretty strong. The slower growth of Capital One outstandings is probably partly a comment on the marketplace a little bit, but the direct impact to the marketplace, but I think it's more so a comment about the choices that we have made. So I want to you know we kind of think back to the last -- really back to 2014 in sort of early to mid 2014 we said that we anticipate an outsized growth benefit and told the marketplace we expected to grow significantly.","And in the second half of 2014, all through 2015 and into 2016 we grew pretty much at the top of the league tables. Around that time, we started flagging that we are concerned about certain supply -- competitive supply issues out there. We\u2019re very carefully monitoring what's going on in our own metrics. And we started to dial back a bit. Not a huge dial back, but dial back progressively around the edges in 2016. In early 2017 you remember when we said that we saw in our own data and in industry data a gapping out of vintage curves a bit. In the second quarter 2016 vintage and we said it striking that it happened, but it's not surprising because this is sort of the natural effect.","So, over this period of time we have been as the marketplace has been increasing in supply we have dial back and want to be sure that we can get confirmation about exactly where that read is with respect to the consumer and the impact of competition. Over the course of this year competitive intensity has settled out a little bit. Supply -- the growth of our revolving credit, it has slowed down. It\u2019s still above GDP growth of course, but I think there are a number of signs that things are settling out a little bit and that's a good sign. What we worry about is whether things rapidly go toward a bad place competitively and I don't think that is happening.","So hopefully there will be a little more growth opportunity next year than there was this year. But I think mostly the numbers on the outstanding side that you see from Capital One are really a reflection of choices on our part and the actual -- the marketing that we\u2019re doing and the products that we are selling we feel very good about it and I think are generating nice results.","Chris Brendler","Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up, I\u2019ll ask about deposits, the consumer deposit cost picked up little bit this quarter. You also saw some decent growth in the consumer deposits. I guess the question all time about your online deposit business and how robust that business is and how sensible is to rising rates. My sense is its doing pretty well. It's hard to see with your current disclosures. Can you just talk about the deposit pricing environment and what you see going forward little bit of focus on online versus offline? Thanks.","Scott Blackley","Yes. I think if you want to understand Capital One on the deposit side, I think the first thing I would say is just study direct banking and study local banking because we\u2019re blend of the two. And we -- our deposit pricing will reflect that blend overtime. And for example, at the end of last year we made some pricing moves and a little bit at the beginning of this year that will make their way into our numbers as we make sure on the direct side of the business that we stay in a reasonably competitive place.","The other thing to understand about Capital One as you think about our deposit business is that we overtime are working to build the national business. We overtime have brought in -- we have grown a lot, our outstandings have grown a lot both from organic growth but also from acquisitions like the GE Healthcare acquisition, the Cabela's acquisition. So if you look at the deposit-to-loan ratio it's on the low end of sort of our norms and overtime we would expect that to grow because their assets have grown, they will be growing and we\u2019re building a national banking capability.","The reason I mention that is that pretty much any bank who is looking to grow its deposits quite a bit will end up paying up more for deposits in a bank who is at the high end of the deposit-to-loan ratio. So it's really not just an issue of what somebody's beta is, it's really kind of \u2013 its kind of a -- its the double strategic question of what beta of a business is and what is the growth appetite and needs of that particular business.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","Thanks guys for taking my question. Hey, Scott, one of things that jumped out to me is that the tax rate that you\u2019re suggesting for 2018 substantially lower than many of the other companies we\u2019ve spoken. I assume that this is a reflection of differences between GAAP and tax accounting. And I'm specifically wondering if this is another signal that charge-offs which drive tax are going to potentially exceed provision which drives GAAP?","Scott Blackley","Rick, I think actually the answer is a bit simpler than that. If you think about Capital One virtually the lion share of our income is from U.S. sources. And so taking down the domestic tax rate from 35 to 21 was a huge tailwind for us, because that impacts the lion share of our income. And then on top of that if you think about we do have some tax-advantaged assets that we own that generate some credits and that's what takes the fully loaded rate inclusive of kind of the stack cost down to the 19% level. So, I don't think there's more to it than that simple explanation.","Rick Shane","Got it. It\u2019s interesting because, historically, your tax rates been a little bit lower, but this is substantially lower. Just one quick follow-up question, the $62 adjusted number, does that include or exclude the discontinued operations?","Richard Fairbank","The $62 excludes discontinued operations. And you can see -- we got a slide there in the appendix that gives you the specifics of what we adjust out.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good evening. Rich, if we see year-over-year change in delinquencies that you talked about earlier actually turned negative which doesn't seem that far-fetched given that we were at 70 basis points year-over-year change back in February down to the kind of like around six now. And I wonder if you could maybe help us think about whether that could actually provide a basis for releasing reserves, all else equal?","Richard Fairbank","So, one thing I want to say as you look at the year-over-year change in delinquencies, of course, think about the Cabela's impact that will be in the new numbers and not in a year ago's numbers, so all the way up until the fall basically the fall of next year they will sort of the that effect, so we\u2019ll have to keep that one in mind. So, the year-over-year change in delinquencies or charge-offs or any of these are going to be driven really by a combination of growth math and industry factors.","The good news is the growth math is reaching the latter stages of being a bad guy if you will. Long run we think it can be a gradual good guy. But of course we have the industry effect that I don't want know to -- I want to make sure we shine a little bit of light on that. We\u2019ve talked about in the last couple of quarters, earnings calls about back book. If you look at -- if you want to get probably the purest, look at sort of industry effects, just go to the securitization trust and just look at everybody\u2019s back books.","And what you will see is for many years the back book -- everybody's back books were a good guy relative they were improving year-over-year. And what striking if you graph the year-over-year change in people's back book delinquencies and also charge-offs you just see this packed kind of set of lines that goes from the negative below the horizontal axis which is a good thing and it just moves over time to the horizontal axis and even in the last year it has been above that which is a nerdy way to say it's gone from being a good guy to a little bit of a bad guy.","So there are industry effects. It's very natural that at this stage of the cycle there would be industry effect. And the other thing for each issuer than is on top of whatever happens with each of our back books is to think about what's happening to everybody's front books. Capital One is I think a little benefited by the fact that we\u2019re farther along in that particular journey than some of the other players, but it is through the everybody's front book that most of the industry normalization happens because it is-- the credit hungry people that get the new accounts and then that tends to be right there at the frontier of how normalization happens.","So, we believe there is an industry effect that is happening. We expect it will continue and we\u2019ll have to -- and how that thing plays out relative to the growth math going from overtime for us from a bad guy to a neutral guy, to a good guy. That\u2019s going to in the end drive our overall credit numbers.","Bill Carcache","Thanks Rich. And if I could just follow-up, it seems like that all the discussion around the things we\u2019re talking about with delinquencies bode well for revenue suppression. Can you talk a little bit about how we should think about the trajectory I guess on revenue margin? I think there's a lot of focus on slowing growth and the impact that that's having on the top line. But I wonder just if there are some offsetting benefits that we should also be thinking about kind of along those lines. Any thoughts would be helpful? Thanks.","Scott Blackley","Yes, Bill, this is Scott. So, certainly suppression is been driven by the same set of factors that have been impacting the credit metrics and the allowance. So as those start to moderate, I think that we would certainly expect that suppression will also be driven by broader industry factors and the things that are impacting our overall loss rate.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra","Thanks. My question was about, when I look at the portfolio, the subprime portfolio has continue to come down from 37% earlier in the year to 34% to end the year in the fourth quarter. Should we -- given the underwriting refinements that you've done, should continue to see that trend continue going forward? And then just as we think about when the growth is coming from higher credit score does that change the shift between transactors and revolvers and any implications of those on the loan yield? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","Yes. Ashish, I think that -- I don't think there's any big news with respect to what's happening to the subprime mix Capital One. I mean, how many years has it been that we\u2019ve been generally around the third? That number did rise during the growth surge of 2014 through 2016, that number rose, and I think it's headed back to little bit more normal levels. So on inside Capital One and the conversations we\u2019re having, we don't see a big mix conversation happening in every segment and sub-segment we look at the market and see what it has to give us. And there was a little bit more a few years ago and I think now it's probably more just to kind of normal mix.","With respect to transactor versus revolver, that is not much about subprime mix. That is really most driven by the growth in heavy spenders and the success of our efforts to drive purchase volume. And when you look at that growth rate and for many years now it's been outstripping the growth rate of outstandings, it's a manifestation that the transactor component depending how you define it, that mix of transactor and basically spender inside our portfolio is growing over time.","Ashish Sabadra","That\u2019s helpful. And then just regarding the window of opportunity and my understanding you\u2019ve start, sounded cautious and looking at the competitive environment there. But what are the metrics that you\u2019re watching for in particular? Is there anything like you called out a couple of them? So given that competitors have been burned in the second half of 2016 with aggressive promotions? Do you think the large issuers will be a lot more cautious this time around? Or will they take the benefit of the windfall? So just any more color on that front? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","Yes. Well, I tend to simplistically look at the marketplace as the revolver marketplace and the spender marketplace. And they are two different marketplaces. Certainly, the most intense one competitively is the spender marketplace. And we have just seen sort of steady ratcheting up of rewards and other forms of giveaways, very striking what has happened over the last few years with respect to upfront bonuses, and also by the way that some of the co-brand products and the little bit of an arms race there with respect to some of their offerings, all of this has happen on a pretty gradually intensifying basis over the last several years.","To your point though, I think it has moderated a bit. Certainly the early spender bonus has moderated a little bit. I sense a bit of, I mean, this is with the small B, but a bit of settling out with respect to the spender competitive marketplace. But it settling out at a very intense level and I think that I would guess from my years of experience in this thing, only the players that have really build a branded franchise based position in this marketplace are going to be able to continue to grow profitably and we are one of those and we continue to do like our chances. But we certainly watch very carefully that marketplace.","And one thing that we are focused on is because the value of this franchise is primarily driven by how long your customers stay with you. Is nothing but expensive to get them and they tend to over the long term be an amazing franchises of low attrition and tremendous credit performance and heavy spending and all of that nice stuff. But -- so, we tend to be on the low side with respect to going after all the promotional near-term kind of stuff. It's a little -- makes it a harder way to make a living, but I think that we like the long-term performance with that philosophy.","In the revolver marketplace what -- certainly the best news in the revolver marketplace has been the stability of pricing over many years. APRs have been stable and actually increasing a little bit over time. And if you \u2013 while it\u2019s hard to exactly get a really good metric on the industries APR in this marketplace, I would say, I think it has increased a little bit more than interest rates have. So relative to say that the middle of the OOs when things were going crazy, I think that's a good sign relative to the marketplace.","To your question what we worry most about is just the amount of supply and how aggressive people are in expanding credit boxes and going out there. And while I think pricing has been stable. There was some aggressiveness in that revolver marketplace that we were uncomfortable with in 2016 in particular and somewhat in 2017, I think people have dialed back a little bit. I think things have settled out a little bit and that might be a good sign.","So, all-in-all I've said this for many years relative to a lot of markets I've e seen, I think the credit card market is intensely competitive but really pretty darn rational. And I think it's \u2013 there\u2019s an opportunity to grow successfully, profitably and resiliently, and we believe that we see that opportunity in front of us.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.","Chris Donat","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to revisit from a little different angle the question of deposit pricing, and Rich I\u2019m wondering with some of the investments you've made in technology over the last few years, if you're in more of a place with deposit pricing where you were decades ago with the other side of the balance sheet on loan pricing and being better able to target or at leasing market on a more direct basis, that\u2019s competitive advantage that other traditional brick-and-mortar banks don't have. Anyway I'm just wondering where you think you stand, competitively on the technology related to deposit pricing?","Richard Fairbank","So, I don't -- I wouldn't say that I think the big advantage that we hope to obtain is the technology for really micro-targeting deposit pricing. Although that certainly \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of investment in that across the industry. I think the technology that I am bullish about being very helpful to us is actually the consumer facing technology of online banking and being able to have a great online experience combined with and build on the shoulders of an infrastructure that we spent years investing in to modernize and integrate from our direct bank and our local bank to modernize and integrate and in a sense rebuild the full technology stack to be able to really credibly offer online banking backed by a thin physical distribution and be able to compete against some of the really great established players. So, my bullishness is really more about that technology than necessarily a real advantage in terms of a micro pricing at the margin.","Chris Donat","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just one question on your expectations for used vehicle pricing, you said you\u2019re looking for them to be down and that seems appropriately cautious and conservative. But do you think \u2013 were these expectations set before factoring in the tax act or does that not really factor into I expect these vehicle prices to play out this year?","Richard Fairbank","We have not yet rolled any particular assumptions about attacks impact making its way into the used-car pricing. I think if you just look historically at used-car pricing, it is not a lot of science and amazing analysis behind. Honestly, if you just eyeball used-car pricing it just has been, it sat for a long long time at very high levels, and while cars I think are lasting longer and so on, I think this thing had only one way to go, and it has gone down.","Interestingly, Manheim does not reflect this, but our own where we have a Capital One index our own index which is has a little bit more of an end, a mix of used cars then some I mean in older cars that certainly has gone down. It\u2019s been locally, it\u2019s been lately stable and even probably rising a bit over the last few months. But I think that the way I look at this from a underwriting point of view, it doesn\u2019t matter how high, how where used-car prices are. What really matters is where they end up relative to where they were when people underwrote them.","And so when an industry is sitting near all-time highs, while Capital One puts in our own underwriting quite a significant decline in used-car pricing. My intuition is the industry just gets too comfortable with the recent history of high used-car prices. And so again, it\u2019s not about where you are, where you are whether they are high or low, it\u2019s just whether the where they are on underwriting versus going forward. And I think there is a way higher chance that they are going down from here than that they are going up and that that\u2019s concerning from an underwriting point of view.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks. Rich, you had mentioned that the prospects of your strong growth opportunities and it\u2019s been referenced a couple of times in the call that you\u2019ve had some fairly significant deceleration on the credit card and a little bit of deceleration in auto. Maybe and the fact that you think that the competitors could get a little more aggressive following seeing those big tax benefits. So maybe if you could just tell us where you think that growth, where we should be expecting that growth to come from?","Richard Fairbank","Yes, so first of all your list is a compelling list of things to be concerned about. And I don\u2019t want, when I say that I\u2019m hopeful for know some enhanced growth opportunity, this is off the base of where we came in with a not counting Cabela\u2019s to 2% year-over-year growth in the card business. So it\u2019s a bit of a low bar of competition when we are talking about up or down from here. But not being flip and about that, what I would know on the positive side, let me start with the negative side. So the negative side is the potential, the potential impact of competitors getting more aggressive, but from this windfall and the empirically some of the same things that we seem competitively particularly last year, and also the fairly high levels of growth of credit, of indebtedness of revolving credit for example.","On the positive side is, over the last number of quarters a little bit of a reduction in supply. You can feel people trimming in their underwriting a little bit. We also have the benefit of more and more months of watching vintage curves settle out. You just no matter how many years I\u2019ve been in this business, it you can, you can believe these things go up and settle out and someday they go down but it\u2019s comforting to see them move in the way that we would expect and so as we get more of our own experience watching these curves settle out and then retro analyzing on every micro segment and so on it tends to lend itself to a little bit more of a growth opportunity.","But we\u2019ll have to see how this plays out. This is not a -- that I\u2019m not sitting here saying I really think there\u2019s a big dramatic growth play here. I just feel pretty good about the opportunity in card. I think if I could comment on auto, the experience over the last number of years has been in a business that\u2019s intensely -- it\u2019s, it\u2019s got amplified, the impacts of competition get amplified and auto because there is an auction, there is an auctioneer sitting in the middle of our lending. And so, the we have seen the value of some competitors backing off in the auto business, you\u2019ve seen such significant growth from Capital One. Lately, it\u2019s a little bit more competitive than before. I think if I pull way up and calibrate relative to all times in the cycle, I think the growth opportunity is still pretty good in the auto business, and the overall -- the industry dynamics for an industry that is so hypersensitive to supply I think are pretty good.","Moshe on the commercial side, we really haven\u2019t talked much about that. I think probably for all players certainly Capital One that the latter part of the year, growth was kind of slow. I think overall though in the commercial space, the and I think that there is a lot of supply out there. I think investors have been pushed out on the risk curve a little bit to seek returns, and I think that the and the impact of nonbanks in the lending space is becoming more significant. So I think our view is pretty moderate there, but we\u2019ll have to see.","Moshe Orenbuch","Just maybe a quick call upon on capital, your capital levels right now are kind of a \u2013 just actually just above where they were at the beginning of the CCAR cycle last year. And so how do we think when you said significant capital distributions in which we think about comparable amounts to what had been in the, in the plan for 2017. As we go for it and recognizing you should have more higher levels of earnings in...","Richard Fairbank","No, Moshe when you think about capital distribution, I mentioned that we want to see our CET 1 kind of drift back to what we think of destination levels is as kind of in the mid-10ths. And so, in the near term I think some of the positive effects of tax reform are going to help us to get there, while still having room for growth, and for capital distribution. And then in overtime, we\u2019ll see exactly how earnings play out and how much competition we see, but if there\u2019s a windfall from tax reform that is enduring that certainly gives us more opportunity for growth and for capital distribution.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari","Good evening. Just another way to ask the vintage question. If I\u2019m looking at the domestic card charge-offs and the current charge-off rate ex-Cabela\u2019s of 536, that\u2019s up from the 464 last quarter. And I know the seasonality there, but can you tell us how much of that 70 basis point differential or a 70 basis point change was from the front book of -- front book growth math versus back book deterioration? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","John, there were -- there was I\u2019m not \u2013 not really going to precisely break those two things out, but that they were both factors in that. And the over the -- in 2017 the back book effect grew and the front book affect over progressive quarters declined consistent with our growth math. But both -- but both factors were meaningful in the year-over-year delta, but the bigger of the two was the growth math.","John Pancari","Okay, all right that\u2019s helpful. Thanks, and then lastly, the on the auto originations that I heard, what you said about that it still represents an opportunity for you, the growth in the auto business but also flagging that it\u2019s still somewhat competitive, as we look at originations I know there are down 5% year-over-year. What\u2019s \u2013 how should we think about overall originations as you look at 2018, is it fair to assume that we are up low single digits?","Richard Fairbank","Gosh, we are the company that has no sets, no growth targets for any of our businesses, because we believe so strongly that in a risk management business and a business in which underwriting isn\u2019t just an actuarial science, it\u2019s really driven by adverse selection and the nature of supply and demand at the margin we make predictions internally as we budget, but and if you just look at our prior behavior, in fact I\u2019ll take you back to that I think it was the last quarter of 2015 when we cautioned, we came in with a really big drop in originations and said that what we had been generally cautioning about really was kind of quite a bit a big deal competitively with respect to some bad practices and the nature of supply, so we had much lower volumes there.","By the time we had fully gotten our investors to internalize our concerns we posted a very, it\u2019s almost like record originations and origination growth in the following couple of quarters. So I think that what I would, so what we do is we describe the conditions that we see in that marketplace, but as a company that doesn\u2019t set growth targets, we work incredibly hard to create growth opportunities, but at the end of the day we take what the market will give us.","And as I said before, the auto business relative to something like the card business is amplified in the impact of competitive effects, and therefore we see the opportunity for as long as we can, we generally like this part of the auto site, marketplace where it is, but it is noteworthy that in the fourth quarter, we posted a lower origination then we have for some time now, and I think that\u2019s just because the competitive thing is in fact stepping up a little bit.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please.","Operator","And our last question for the evening comes from Ken Bruce with Bank of America.","Ken Bruce","Thanks, good evening guys. My question relates to the guidance that the earnings growth will accelerate in 2018 and off the 7.74 benchmark. I mean most of us I think had expected that to occur anyway just with the with cold spring beginning to release of the earnings growth potential of the tax rate going from your high 20s to 19 should really put that on steroids. I\u2019m trying to kind of figure out if you are just being extremely cautious around what \u2013 what or conservative around kind of what that acceleration can be or if you are seeing anything that as you think about the competitive intensity and the potential for this to be competed away that it\u2019s coming sooner than later. I mean, I think that that would take place over some period of time. Most of your bank peers are trying to rebuild capital after the DTA write-downs and the like so, if you could just maybe kind of give us some thought as to kind of where your are most concerned about repricing [credit card and auto] loans lower or other kind of really aggressive marketing activity that could significantly undermine your earnings growth potential assumes to me as can be really good.","Richard Fairbank","Well I mean as we \u2013 so first of all how we feel about our business and its prospects is very similar to where we were at the day before. And in fact last quarter when we were talking to you and so what happened this quarter will along came the tax reform bill. So are we -- so the first of all we are the same company with the same kind of feeling about our prospects that we had prior to the tax effect. And our point is, in the near-term the tax thing have to be I mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine that it couldn\u2019t be a an important good guy relative to financial performance for ourselves, and really everyone else.","And all we are saying is, that we are very reluctant to get in the prediction business and in fact not only reluctant to get in the prediction of business, but my own experience from just doing this business for over two decades now is I have seen windfalls and shortfall that hit the industry over the next couple of years they have a striking way to make their place there that their way into the marketplace.","So examples, I mentioned the example of the bankruptcy reform in 2005. There is the tax act of 1986, and I wasn\u2019t born yet so that was more reading a history book there, but from our little kind of retro study of that and not as experts, but that there was a lot of sort of making its way into the marketplace there. And then conversely, when I\u2019ve been struck over the years how when the times get tougher and tighter in their credit pressures and things like this, there are ways that their credit card business in particular has a way of offsetting that with respect to the overall metrics.","So for example, how volatile the credit card charge-offs are, and it\u2019s a little bit of a scary exercise to take any P&L of a credit card business and then just project the wild volatility that can happen with respect to losses and then you say, well gosh if losses were that high and you just had all the same things that would be terrible or if losses got incredibly good, you would be printing money at a staggering kind of level. But the offsetting effects that happened in the marketplace have been striking to me in both directions over the years.","So, I look at this and so my point is partly we certainly don\u2019t want to be in the guidance business about that number but you all can draw your own conclusions and we are not by the way, I want to make it clear, we are not going to try to be one that sets an arms race off at all with respect to this. This is more of a just a prediction that things have a way of going into the marketplace and that my caution to investors would be I wouldn\u2019t book this stuff before it, totally happen to be the biggest question is not whether it is when and the timing and to your point there is a good case to be made that this is a gradual thing it\u2019s not an immediate thing and therefore particularly in 2018, this I think stands to be quite a good guy.","Ken Bruce","Thank you. And just lastly, and hopefully quickly the in terms of the increasing competitiveness in auto is are you seeing that in terms of expanding of credit box again, or are you seeing it in terms of pricing or something else?","Richard Fairbank","No, I think it\u2019s a mild, it\u2019s little a locally mild thing. I, like we go running down the streets waving red flags when we see bad underwriting process and practices. We, we don\u2019t really have anything new to report there. I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything dramatic. I think what is happening is we\u2019ve had an unusually benign if you will period of competition in the 2016 and 2017 period. That I think we will look back at that and say, it normalized from there, and I think that it\u2019s just a natural thing. People move into those spaces a little bit more. Some of the folks that maybe had backed off a little bit, particularly one of them is stepping it up a bit and I think all this is natural, so it \u2013 I think it\u2019s much more likely this thing will normalize competitively than that it will be as good as it was for these last couple years for us.","Jeff Norris","Thank you very much everyone for joining us on this conference call today. And thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have.

With me these evenings are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Steve Crawford, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer.

Steve?","Steve Crawford","Thanks Jeff, I\u2019ll begin tonight with slide 3. Capital One earned $1 billion or $1.84 per share in the first quarter. Pre-provision earnings increased 10% from the fourth quarter to $3 billion as we had higher revenues and lower marketing and operating expenses. Provision for credit losses increased linked quarter driven by higher charge-offs and a $286 million allowance build including $73 million of allowance build in our oil and gas portfolio. ","As you can see on slide 4 reported NIM decreased 4 basis points from the fourth quarter to 6.75%, driven by one last day of recognized income and a full quarter of lower yielding GE commercial assets, partially offset by higher interest rates.","NIM increased 18 basis point year-over-year fuelled by strong growth in our domestic card business.","Turning to slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 11.1%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.9%. We reduced our net share count by 12.8 million shares in the quarter. As we completed our previously announced incremental 300 million in repurchases in the first quarter. We are on track to complete our remaining C card authorization by the end of the second quarter of 2016.","As we continue our parallel run for Basel III advanced to purchase, we estimate that our common equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was above our target of 8%.","Let me now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard Fairbank","Thanks Steve, I\u2019ll begin on slide 7 with our domestic card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our ending loans and average loans were both up 14%. We continued to like the earnings profile and the resilience of the business we\u2019re booking.","First-quarter revenue increased 12% from the prior-year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margin declined modestly. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%. As a reminder, payment protection revenue contributed about 25 basis points to full-year 2015 revenue margin. Because we completed the exit of our back book of payment protection products at the end of the first quarter, we expect this contribution to go to zero in the second quarter revenue margin.","Purchase volume in the first quarter increased about 20% from the prior year. Net interchange revenue for the total company also increased 20%. Although the two growth rates were the same this quarter, we\u2019ve consistently emphasized the need to look at longer term trends to understand that interchange growth without the quarterly volatility.","For the past several years, on an annual basis net interchange growth has been well below domestic card purchase volume growth. We\u2019d expect this divergence to continue as we continue to expand and strengthen our rewards franchise by originating new rewards customers and extending rewards to existing customers.","Also a few of the largest merchants have negotiated custom deals with the card networks that will make their way into interchange revenue overtime. First quarter non-interest expenses increased compared to the prior-year quarter, with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments.","As we've discussed for several quarters, two factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is growth math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio.","The second is seasonality. All else equal, the first quarter is the seasonal peak for charge-off rate. Our guidance for domestic card charge-off rate remains unchanged. We expect the upward pressure from growth math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4% with quarterly seasonal variability. Based on what we see today and assuming relative stability and consumer behavior the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we still expect full year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4s with quarterly seasonal variability.","Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rise in charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the quarter. We expect allowance additions going forward primarily driven by growth.","Slide 8 summarizes first-quarter results for our consumer banking business. Ending loans were down a little less than $1 billion compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by planned mortgage run-off. Ending deposits were up about $5.3 billion and versus the prior year.","Auto originations in the first quarter were $5.8 billion, about 13% higher compared to the first quarter of last year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, originations shrink particularly in subprime. This quarter, originations growth was stronger including in subprime. We had good success with our originations programs and it appears that competitive intensity may have softened a bit in the quarter. But we wouldn\u2019t take much from any one quarter of results. We still feel the same way about this business as we have for several quarters. We remain very vigilant about competitor practices, in our underwriting we assume used card prices declined further. We continue to focus on resilient originations and we continue to expect gradual or normalization of margin and credit.","Consumer banking revenue for the quarter increased modestly from the first quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was offset by margin compression in auto and declining mortgage balances.","First quarter revenues were also aided by rewards liability release associated with discontinuing certain checking products. Non-interest expense increased compared to the prior year quarter driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing.","First quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, mostly as a result of growth in auto loans and a modestly higher auto charge-off rate. We also added to the consumer banking allowance for loan losses in the quarter. As we previously discussed, we expect auto charge-offs to increase gradually and in the first quarter we observed a decline in used vehicle values.","These two factors drove the allowance addition. In our retail deposit businesses, customer needs and preferences are changing driving changes to the function, format and number of our branches. Like all banks we\u2019ve been optimizing both the format and number of branches to better meet the evolving needs of our customers as banking goes digital.","In 2015 branch optimization costs were about $50 million. We are planning to accelerate these efforts and we expect branch optimization cost to be elevated in 2016. We are still formulating specific plans and timings, but based on what we see today we expect to recognize branch optimization expenses of about $160 million in 2016. In the first quarter, actual charges were $11 million. This category rather than the consumer bank P&L.","We expect several factors to put pressure on our consumer banking financial results in 2016. In the home loans business planned mortgage run off continues. In auto finance, margins are compressing and charge-offs are rising modestly. And our deposit businesses continue to face a prolonged period of low interest rates. We expect these factors will negatively affect consumer banking revenue, efficiency ratio and net income in 2016 even as we continue to tightly manage cost.","Moving to slide 9, I\u2019ll discuss our commercial banking business. Ending loan balances in the quarter increased 27% year-over-year, and average loans increased 24% including the acquisition of GE Healthcare Finance business.","Excluding the $8.3 billion of loans acquired from GE ending loans grew about 10% year-over-year. While competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in both CRE and CNI, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals.","Revenue in the first quarter increased 14% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Revenue growth was below average loan growth because of continuing spread compression. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and taxi medallion portfolios.","Provision for credit losses increased $168 million from the prior-year quarter to $228 million, as we continued to build reserves. We\u2019ve been building reserves over the last six quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans. Downgrades of oil and gas loans drove first quarter increases in criticized and non-performing loans.","The commercial bank criticized loan rate was 5.6% in the first quarter comprised of the criticized performing loan rate of 4% and the criticized non-performing loan rate of 1.6%. We continue to focus on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. As you can see on slide 10, our total oil and gas loans ended the first quarter at $3.2 billion or about 1.5% of total company loans as some exploration and production customers drew on their lines in the quarter.","Unfunded exposure decrease to $2.7 billion, total exposure including both loans and unfunded exposure decline to $5.9 billion, we expect that oil and gas loans will continue to present challenges and we've been building reserves to reflect that concern.","At quarter end approximately $262 million of our total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This allowance is about 8% of total oil and gas loans.","Including unfunded reserves plus allowance we hold $359 million in total reserves allocated to the oil and gas portfolio. While our current reserves fully reflect all the information we have today as the turmoil and the energy industry continues future developments could lead to further reserve builds and possibly increasing charge-offs.","I'll close tonight with some thoughts on first quarter results and our outlook for 2016. We posted another strong quarter of growth in domestic card loan balances and purchase volumes driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue, as well as related increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses.","Non-interest expense decreased 6% from the linked quarter driven by seasonal declines in marketing and operating expense. First quarter non-interest expense does not represent a run rate for the remaining quarters of 2016 for several reasons.","The first quarter is typically a low point for non-interest expense. Our businesses continue to grow. We expect about $100 million in elevated branch optimization cost to impact the remainder of 2016, and we expect the net impact of FDIC surcharges and premium changes to add about $20 million to quarterly operating expense beginning in the third quarter of 2016.","Provision for credit losses increased in the quarter. We added to the allowance for loan losses, primarily because of domestic card loan growth and the expectation of higher domestic card charge-off rates because of growth math.","We expect these factors to drive further allowance builds in 2016. We also build commercial banking reserves in the quarter to reflect increasing risk in energy loan. Our efficiency ratio guidance is not changing.","Compared to 2015, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio with continuing improvement in 2017 excluding adjusting item. To be clear there were no adjusting items in the first quarter.","We planned to deliver efficiency improvement despite the additional pressure from elevated branch optimization cost, higher FDIC expense and deterioration in marketing expectations for interest rate.","We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time, and we continue to tightly managed cost across our business. Pulling up, we continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks, as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.","Now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions.","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We'll now start Q&A session. As currently the other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any questions after the Q&A session, Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Sam, please start the Q&A session. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Rich, I heard you say don't look just in each quarter in terms of like growth rate of interchange income, but you had a couple of quarters where it's kind of match or been close to matching the level of the growth rate in spending volumes. Could you just talk a little bit about what will cause it, I mean, if you're saying that it will diverge and go lower, like what is the cause in the future. Have you got specific plans for growth and can maybe just relate that to how you see the competitive environment for rewards right now?","Richard Fairbank","Okay, Moshe. So the most important point is to just reflect on the volatility of this number and particularly as we turn in the second consecutive quarter of where this \u2013 the number meaning the net interchange growth number where it is as high as it is, we go out of our way to remind folks that there's a lot that goes in to this particular calculation and these contribute to its volatility.","So, let me start Moshe with just the volatility side of this thing. The net interest interchange metric includes partnership, contractual payments and international card and consumer bank net interchange and also we update our rewards liability every quarter based on points earned and redeemed the redemption mix and redemption rates. And so, any one quarter we probably spend more calories explaining that volatility than we do just reporting it just to make sure that folks focus on the longer term trends.","If you look at the full year 2015 compared to 2014, our net interchange grew 11% compared to purchase volume growth of 21%. So, if we get pass the quarterly noise part of the conversation. Let's talk about why net interchange growth has generally lag domestic card purchase volume growth and why we also expect that to continue. Our rewards programs have been and continue to be very successful with -- yes of course strong growth in flagship products like Quicksilver and Venture and our Spark card, but we're also building a long term franchise very consciously and consistently by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers and extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards.","And as you can imagine this entails some near term cannibalization when we do this. But it's all part of building stronger, deeper customer franchise. And those trends \u2013 I mean we're well on our way with respect to those trends, but they will continue. And also -- and this is something that will be a newer effect in the numbers that's not in our prior numbers, a few of the larger merchants have negotiated customer interchange deals with the network and those economics on negotiations that have now happened will make their way into the interchange metrics for card players.","So, you ask the question about rewards competition. This is a very competitive space, I think the competition has intensified a bit over the past years, over the past year really issuers are continuing to introduce new offers, upfront bonuses have been gradually increasing over time. I still look at this, as the player its generally rational, intensely competitive and our strategy is design to go right into a marketplace like that.","So, we'll keep an eye obviously on interchange risk, I mean, that's a different orthogonal factor, but I think that we still feel pretty optimistic about that. That variable overall in the marketplace and all-in-all as we post another quarter of pretty strong performance we \u2013 it\u2019s really more of the same story that we've seen in the past and despite intense competitive we still see a window of opportunity to grow and beyond sort of the notion of window here I think this is just part of the same strategy of Capital One to invest in and going at the top end of the marketplace and I think we're very pleased with our success.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thanks very much.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Rich Shane with JPMorgan.","Rich Shane","Thank you for taking my questions. Really there is sort of related, Rich, you've been very clear about your decision to be little bit more cautious in auto. Over the last several quarters you're actually going back probably four, five quarters, you've been pretty bullish on the opportunity in the card space. Do you see that opportunity still being there? And in light of the growth that you're experience now, I understand the growth math impacting losses into 2016, why are you so confident that they're going to start to flatten out into 2017 as you continue to grow? ","Richard Fairbank","Okay. Rick, several questions there. First of all you mentioned auto and card, so let me do a little cross calibration relative to those two. We see growth opportunities in both businesses, in fact you saw an auto actually growth stepped up a little, although we went out of our way to say, don't get carried away with that. I think our message is really the same as before, frankly, in both businesses our message is really the same as we had last quarter.","On a cross calibration, I think the auto business is a little bit further along in the sort of the natural evolution of a market and the competitive dynamic associated with that and I think we see less growth opportunity there even though at the margin we're both vigilant and very much working to capture the opportunities that are consistent with our underwriting.","On the card side, I think that the marketplace is despite very competitive is still, I'd say it's very rational. The competitors have staked our different positions in the marketplace with different strategies and several are succeeding all at the same time. Where we are finding growth is an opportunities that are through the result of investments for years and strategic focus and testing and a lot of things that give rise to a more sustainable growth opportunity. Again, I still would flag nothing last forever and we'll take this one quarter at a time. But we feel the same way about the card business as we do a quarter \u2013 did a quarter ago.","I think there are still lags on the growth opportunity here. And again, it will all be down within abandons of caution and knowing that window is always open and close, but I think we still are quite bullish about this opportunity. Now, then you said, so what about growth math? The growth math, because we have the \u2013 the key thing about growth math that is \u2013 that's so central to our explanation about credit at the moment is not just that we're doing a lot of growth right now. And as you know Rick, growth entails sort of peak losses on a vantage in the first couple of years before a thing settled out.","So you have that component, but the fact that it is on top of almost we never quite seen before the extend of such a season resilient back book that the juxtaposition of high growth on top of a highly season back book creates particularly more dramatic growth math effects. All of that said, it's also the case that if you overlaying a bunch of vintages that have the same credit growth dynamics, there is just a natural seasoning effect that occurs. Frankly whether growth continues or whether growth slows down that becomes a pretty strong effect in causing the credit effects of growth math to settle out in the latter part of the time horizon that we have provided guidance for.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good afternoon. The couple of questions, one was just on Richard mentioned, the custom deals that the larger networks has struck with some of the larger merchants. I just wanted to get a sense from you as to the pace of impact on your fee rates that you're anticipating from this. Is it something that is a few basis points over a year time or it just tens of basis points over a couple of quarters? Maybe give sense of magnitude and timing and then whether or not you feel that as it plays out to other merchants, this is just something we should put in our model for the next year or two?","Richard Fairbank","So, I think there are some \u2013 there are really kind of a couple of one-off things that have happened, that have been negotiated and those will become enduring effects relative to those merchants. So those effects will make their way over the course of the next number of quarters into a change in the run rate of interchange from those couple of merchants. And I don't think this is just like a see [ph] change in how the industry works, but we just wanted to flag that these I think well known things that have gone on in the marketplace, have a natural impact as they flow into any of the major card players.","Betsy Graseck","So, is it changing your go-to-market strategy with rewards as you indicated with this, this is just kind of noise in the background as oppose to we have to change, how we are thinking about rewards with this custom deals happening?","Richard Fairbank","The reality is the merchant marketplace even though it\u2019s a lot more consolidated than it was years ago, it still when you really stand back and look at it a strikingly fragmented marketplace and this does not have any impact on our overall strategy.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. Rich, you talked about possibly more provisions in the oil and gas portfolio, could you just talk about the sensitivity going forward?","Richard Fairbank","So, I think that, look, I don't think we want to be in the sensitivity business. I think we did scenario last time that went through sort of the mathematical impact of a one unique set of assumptions about prices and all that happened is our own provision was different, but the external scenario was different and our own allowance build reserve and everything else ended up being unique.","So, I think what I would say is this. It maybe useful just to pull back and just talk about the provision in the quarter for a minute and then I come back and comment on your question, but if we look at our -- we had a $157 million of the $228 million commercial provision expense was related to energy and $18 million was due to charge-offs mainly in the oil and field services segment. We build reserves by $139 million, and of that our unfunded build was $54 million.","As we used higher utilization assumptions for some borrowers given the somewhat defensive behavior that we saw during the quarter, and then lower oil and gas prices run off on hedges and declining collateral values also impacted our borrowers and contributed to the reserve build. And then there were some odds and end to round out the build in provision.","So, I think that what we have done in terms of allowance and unfunded reserve builds reflects what we see with our customers and in the marketplace at this time, but I think it is also the nature of markets that sometimes feed on each other that I think that they still needs the deleveraging of the oil and gas industry, still needs to happen. I think we've reserve for that which we see and I think it's our expectation that it will take a while and have continuing credit impacts as this thing fully plays out.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And just a follow-up, just that revenue margins disclosure going forward in terms of protection products, how much of the 25 basis points was in the first quarter, that's going to go to zero on the second quarter? And then when I look at the U.S. card \u2013 sorry the domestic card revenue margin, that came down quite significantly year-over-year. Could you just maybe talk, speak to the trajectory going forward maybe? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","Okay. First of all, to your cross-sell question. As we mentioned we fully exited cross-sell at the end of the first quarter and we'll have no cross-sell revenue in the second quarter. But yes, some of that affect happened in the first quarter, the first quarter was I don't have the exact number in front of me, but something in the neighborhood of half of the -- is around 10 basis points and being the amount of revenue that we got and that was around 10 basis points. So that would be your answer on that.","The domestic card revenue margin, it's interesting how stable that has been over the years. That has been \u2013 there's been a lot of factors that have worked in opposite directions on that margin. There is certainly been a macro effect that we've been flagging over time in terms of things that we call franchise enhancements where we continue to make choices in the customers favor and that have a bit of impact on revenue.","The most dramatic of these in recent years has been this cross-sell effect and it is now fully playing out. I think the biggest impacts on revenue margin going forward will not be so much of the franchise \u2013 further franchise enhancement, although here and there those always go on. I think it\u2019s the \u2013 whatever happens in the competitive marketplace which is every intense, and we will continue to monitor that, but I think we're going to stay out of forecasting business with respect to revenue margins.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to David Ho with Deutsche Bank.","David Ho","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to talk about some of the asset sensitivity and I know it's been coming down the last three or four quarters. I know that the outlook on rates obviously continuous to evolve but certainly little lower here versus your expectations. Can you talk about just your balancing strategy and how do you think about positioning this year?","Richard Fairbank","Yes. It's not our policy and try to end up with a large asset sensitive position that's kind of naturally what we end up with as a result of the balance sheet that we have. So we find ourselves in an asset sensitive position but I think we probably if we could do it in an efficient way work to not have as much sensitivity. I should mention we do have some work underway that suggest deposit pricing may not lag as much as we've originally estimated. ","There's no final decisions estimate on that point and we probably won't had a more fully formed analysis of that until the second quarter in terms of how it might change our disclosed impacts. But we're taking all of the actions that we can at our accounting friendly to manage the interest rate risk. And really what we're trying to do is balance kind of near term net interest income sensitivity which longer term changes in economic value.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs","Ryan Nash","Hi, good evening guys. Steve, maybe you could follow-up a little bit on that last comment you made about that deposit pricing likely won't lag as much you expected, what is it given that betas have been extremely low across the industry? What is that you're seeing that leads you to the conclusion that it might not be as low.","Steve Crawford","I think we are all struggling with and as you look across the industry at management comments, with the extraordinary change in the actual balance sheets of different depositories and then the extraordinary influence of central banks and the market place and a real uncertainty is to how regulation impacts, deposit flow is going forward and the nature of completion, we're not a period where history provides much comfort to try and figure out where we're headed.","So, I think it\u2019s just not surprising that we will continue to be to look at our assumptions on interest rate, sensitivity and risk management and frankly trying to be creative about how this environment which is so different and unlike an unprecedented to how that's going to unfold and what that should mean for how we manage interest rate risk.","Now if in fact things due change and our model suggest we are less sensitive, I think that will be a good thing and we'll have avoided for instance, putting on more hedges than we would have otherwise done. So, but I think this is something that everybody in the industry expresses a lot of uncertainly about and its continuing to look at what the implications of that our for rate risk and rate risk management.","Ryan Nash","See if you let, let me interrupt, almost 10% expenses are up 6%. I take the fact that there some headwinds over the next couple of quarters from the branch optimization from the FDIC, but if we continue to see loan growth at these various strong levels, can you help us understand just the magnitude of efficiency improvement, do you think you can continue to drive similar like levels to what we've seen year-over-year, would you expect to see somewhat of a deceleration. And what is a future benefit of the branch optimization that you're doing this year? Thanks.","Steve Crawford","Yes. We really spend a lot of time on the guidance that we gave last quarter and Rich talked about some of the challenges that have emerged over the last three months to that guidance which were absorbing and keeping where it is. And I think with all the puts and takes that's about as far as we prepared to go. Obviously the branch optimization in and of itself on a narrow basis creates savings, but we're also investing in that business in other places and really what we want to do is talk about this on consolidated level. Rich, I don't know whether you have anything to add.","Richard Fairbank","Nothing.","Steve Crawford","Okay.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Brendler with Stifel.","Chris Brendler","Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just wonder to see if you any additional color you provide on the strong purchase volume growth in the U.S. card business, 20% is very strong and it seems like most of your competitors are trying to piggy back on Quicksilver and other successes in the cash back space. Any thoughts on the competitive environment with that 20% growth, can you sustain that level?","And I'd also like you to address the private label businesses, is that contributing to that strong growth or is that actually dragging on that. It seems to me you haven't really invested or done a whole lot of private label since you bought that HSBC business? Thanks","Richard Fairbank","Okay. Chris, the purchase volume continues to be strong, let's talk about where we're seeing it. We're seeing it across various segments in our business that are growing nicely and obviously the spender and rewards business is growing in our revolver business where we focus on revolvers rather high balance revolvers, we see it in small business. But the growth results from success of our rewards programs, it results from new account origination but also credit line increases. And there is an element of this as you're familiar with the fact that we over the last couple of years increased credit line quite significantly making up for kind of a brown-out that preceded that period of time.","Now we're in equilibrium with respect to credit line increases. But as people utilize extra line as you have new originations just the utilization of the card, all of these thing help grow purchase volume. So, the purchase volume numbers are the results of direct success in spend oriented programs as well as it\u2019s a byproduct of all the growth that's going on at Capital One.","Can we sustain this? I think that we're in a good competitive position, but obviously a lot of other competitors are investing heavily and have a lot of very successful things that they're doing, so we will continue to take this opportunity as far as it will take us but we're cognizant of the intense competition there.","Private label with respect to growth rate is in a different place because that's relatively modest growth rate, because we have not been adding lot of big partnerships. Some of our existing partnerships are having nice growth but that business is in an intense competitive period around auction prices and we've gone to a bunch of auctions. We've tended to come up empty handed lately because of \u2013 we're not been willing to go to some of the extreme levels that we have seen where the market clearing price goes.","All that said, we like the partnership business and I think it has continued opportunity, but in that business that is so auction driven, I think we have to be very respectful about the nature of the auction pricing cycle within that business and make sure that we don't do unnatural things for the seek of growth.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Citi.","Don Fandetti","Yes. Rich, if you look around at the major card issuers, it looks like consumer credit very strong. But if you look on the edges for example, the marketplace lenders, they're starting to have problems, and I was just curious if you thought that could be canary in the coal mine or if you think that just a more of a reflection of aggressive growth and maybe not having good credit underwriting in their DNA?","Richard Fairbank","First of all, I want to start with your opening point, consumer credit and especially card credit have been exceptionally strong for some years now. And for Capital One if you peel away the effects of growth math that's still very much the case. And when we look at our back book for example credit is strikingly stable with some pockets have even continuing improvement.","And this very strong credit environment has been the result of for ourselves and the industry highly -- highly seasoned back book is made up largely of customers who weathered the great recession, a more disciplined consumer who is less likely to be over stretched or over indebted and a economy that has slow though it has been sort of on a long sustained kind of recovery here.","But from where we sit today, my biggest worry and it kind of gets to your question is the potential impact of growing a competition and actually the growth itself that we see of credit around us. We\u2019ve seen a growth of revolving debt creep up to about 6% recently. That\u2019s pretty high relative to the low and sometimes negative levels since the recession.","And both consumers and creditors have been very cautious. Beyond card growth, we\u2019ve seen growth in other non-mortgage debt. We\u2019ve seen it institute [ph] in lending, auto lending and installment lending and we are watching that closely as well and installment lending which I think the banks have gradually returned to has been the primary asset class for the alternative lenders and you may remember we had an installment lending book that into the great recession was probably our worst performing portfolio.","So we -- my point is primarily a installment lending point but the broader point is all of this -- the math of the amount of growth that we see in the credit market place is not lost on us. Now it is in the context of a particularly on the card side growth being flattish for a long period of time so we are not overly alarmed by just a surge of growth but we\u2019ll certainly have to keep an eye on this. And we know that in the end the growth, the things that we see in the market place with respect to growth not only affect our growth opportunity they can affect credit with the selection quality of new originations and can impact existing customers who take on more debt from other players.","So, all of that is stuff that we look at, at this point Don we have not seen these effects in our performance. We\u2019ve reaffirmed our guidance but it\u2019s just a reminder why we focus so much on resilience. We don't set growth targets in company. We focus on capturing highly resilient opportunities when we have them and in the end always that we're in the risk management business, but right now net-net we still feel very good about our opportunity here and we feel very good about the credit outlook.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill.","Ken Bruce","Thanks. Good evening. I would like to piggyback off of the questions around credit. I guess you've talked about the general performance. Can you address the subprime portfolio, subprime credit card portfolio that's obvious grown a whole lot. And then just interested if it's in performing in line with your original expectations and if you could dimensionalize how you expect the economics of that portfolio to perform over the next year, 1.5 years? Thank you.","Steve Crawford","Ken, it is performing consistent with our expectations, and we've been that business for a long period of time and what we see is consistent with what we've learned over the year about that business and we like its profitable business. We like its resilience and we're continuing to grow in that of one of many segments that we're growing in at the moment.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Wassterstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wassterstrom","Thanks very much. Maybe just a follow-up on that last point. Could you give us a sense of -- in the new accounts that are being booked, how they compare from a FICO stratification standpoint, or some other underwriting metric to the historical growth?","Richard Fairbank","Yes. We're growing in segments in which we have a lot of history and a strong track record even through the great recession. We're in our branded card business. It\u2019s probably not exaggeration to say when we look at the major places we're investing, we're growing in all of them with the exception of one \u2013 we are growing in all of those and there is one place we're not growing, we're actively working to continue to dial that down and to shrink it and that's the high balance revolvers.","The combination of these factors has driven our portfolio mix of 650 and below assets, a little higher over the past year. Generally though our portfolio mix has been about one-third plus or minus, I think recently it\u2019s been a little bit more on plus side.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Arren Cyganovich with D.A. Davidson.","Arren Cyganovich","Thanks. Excuse me, there is -- one of your competitors in the online banking business had acquired a brokerage and wealth management company. I was wondering what you see as the opportunities? I know you have some of that business that you've built organically. And are you pursuing that strategy? Is there an opportunity to grow that or acquire other businesses related?","Steve Crawford","We're not \u2013 we're certainly in that business. We're not a big player in brokerage and wealth management space. I think that it is not \u2013 it\u2019s an area on an organic basis we continue to work to growth opportunities. We're kind of a small player. I don't think that the big wirehouses are shaking in their boots about Capital One. But especially for our existing customers we've got some really nice, very refreshing high value products for our customers, but it still off of a very small base at this point.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matt Burnell","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Rich, I wanted to follow up on a couple of earlier questions in terms of you've mentioned for several quarters the opportunity, particularly for growth, particularly in cards. I am curious what you see as a potential yellow flag or warning signal that might signal to you that maybe that growth opportunity is coming to an end? Is it economic factors or is it some of the competitive factors that you mentioned earlier?","Richard Fairbank","So, I think \u2013 look, the economy is always a wildcard there, but I don't think that is where that \u2013 as our growth I think is going to be more driven unless there's a dramatic kind of change in the economy. I think it\u2019s going to be much more driven by the competitive environment and the related impacts of that competitive environment on the credit environment.","And we just learned long ago one of the things that makes this business what it is in terms of the opportunity to make money and get growth opportunities, but on the same its always something that we have to remind ourselves is the relationship between competitive practices that both how intensive the marketing is, the underwriting practices, the pricing and those things, how much they impact not only growth but ultimately make their way into the credit side of the business as well.","And this is one business where our own customers and a lot of credit business this customers have a lending product from one bank. In this case people can have credit cards with a lot of players and then of course they hold the lending products from others as well. So as I have said and I still actually would describe the credit card market place this way, on a cross calibration with the rest of the industries that we are in, I think this is the most rational of the market places.","But certainly the thing that we are watching the most is the level of supply out there and I think the underwriting competition has been very rational which is a good thing, but we will continue to watch that competition and then look for impacts that can come with that, that would signal to us that it would be appropriate to slow down or whatever.","But again, you always know us, we are always in the go out and look out and [Indiscernible] at things to worry about, but I think that we continue to like the opportunity in the current space.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our final question today comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.","Chris Donat","Hey good afternoon, thanks for squeezing me in, me in here. Was just curious to follow up on the last question, as we look at the disclosures in your 10-Q we see that your subprime credit card balances have been growing in the high teens or even 20% in the fourth quarter. In terms of the competitive landscape are you really facing much competition or do you have a lot of running room compared to what other issuers are doing?","Richard Fairbank","So one of the things that has been striking to us is the amount of -- there\u2019s a lot of consumer credit is in that space. There is a number of major competitors are actually growing in that space and also what impacts that business a lot is the what spills downstream from the prime business as consumers migrate. And so, when you -- and you can look at the overall disclosures on how much the various banks have of 660 and below. And you can see that there is a pretty sizeable amount of business that each of the players have. I think they have different strategies with respect to them.","Capital One\u2019s case we explicitly actually target certain pockets within that business, other players it\u2019s more of a byproduct of more generalized marketing that they do and some of the retail bank players I think they are going to this space with your own customers that they know well. So I think that it\u2019s a more competitive space then I think sometimes urban legend will have it, but that Capital One I think just has a more unique approach to the business and one of the striking things I\u2019ll mention again about the card business is the major card players have staked out unique strategies for how they play in this business and relative to most businesses that we are in I am struck by the differences in those strategies and frankly look around and see a lot of successful players doing smart things given where they are and the bone structure of assets that they have and it leads to the simultaneous success I think of a number of players.","Richard Fairbank","Well thank you everyone for joining us on the conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. As I mentioned before the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Thanks again.

To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One\u2019s website capitalone.com and follow the links from there.","In addition to the press release and the financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2014 results. With me today is Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Steve Crawford, Capital One\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.

Steve?","Steve Crawford","","Thanks Jeff. I will begin tonight with slide three Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $2.04 a share in the second quarter and had a return on average tangible common equity of 17.5%. We reduced our net share count by 11.1 million shares in the quarter reflecting our share buyback actions. Included in continuing operations results for this quarter were higher linked-quarter revenues, flat linked-quarter non-interest expenses, a lower provision for loan losses driven by lower charge-offs and a $100 million allowance release, a $37 million addition to our reserves regarding UK cross sell, which was split almost evenly between non-interest expense and non-interest income. In the UK refunds to customers who bought payment protection insurance is an industry wide issue and continues to be in the headlines.","Our reserve build reflects the fact that while the number of customer claims we receive is continuing to fall, it hasn't fallen as quickly as forecasted. The reserve build does not reflect any change in how we calculate customer refunds. It is possible that we may further add to reserves if we determine that we need to change the calculation of customer refunds. And finally, we had an $18 million benefit related to mortgage rep and warranty which includes the provision of $11 million before taxes in discontinued operations and a benefit of $29 million before taxes in continuing operations.","Turning to slide four, I'll touch briefly on net interest margin. Reported NIM decreased 7 basis points in the second quarter to 6.55%, primarily driven by lower yields and average balances in our domestic card business partially offset by the second quarter having one more day worth of recognized income. Average interest earning assets were up modestly quarter-over-quarter primarily driven by higher average loan balances in our auto finance and commercial banking segments.","We are updating our expectation for mortgage runoff in 2014 to about $6 billion based on our current view of rates.","Moving to slide five, I\u2019ll briefly cover capital trend. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized fully phased-in basis was 11.6% in the second quarter of 2014 compared to a Basel III standardized fully phased-in equivalent ratio of 11.7% in the first quarter of this year. With the benefit of phase-in, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.7%, down 30 basis points from the Basel III standardized equivalent of 13% in the first quarter of this year. And while we have yet our parallel run for Basel III advanced approaches, we continue to estimate we are above our target of 8%.","Last, we reduced our net share count by 11.1 million shares in the quarter, reflecting our share buyback actions. We completed approximately 1 billion of our share buyback program in the second quarter and we expect to buy an additional 1.5 billion over the next three quarters. We have demonstrated our commitment to return capital and understand it remains an important part of the return equation for our shareholders.","I\u2019ll close tonight with the brief update of our 2014 expectations. We continue to expect pre-provision earnings to be about $10 billion, within a reasonable margin of air. And we continue to expect some modest but principally offsetting changes with higher revenues offsetting higher expenses relative to our expectations earlier this year. While we had a release of allowance in the quarter, going forward as we return to growth and considering the charge-offs remain below historical averages, we\u2019re less likely to see going forward.","With that, let me turn the call over to Rich.","Richard Fairbank","Thanks Steve. I'll begin on slide seven, which shows another strong quarter posted by our domestic card business highlighted by a return to year-over-year growth. The year-over-year trends in loans and purchase volume continue to reflect our strategic choices which focus on generating attractive sustainable and resilient returns.","Ending loans were up about 4% from the first quarter and about 1% year-over-year. We had expected year-over-year growth to resume sometime in the second half of 2014. The early return to year-over-year loan growth resulted from increasing traction in the segments we\u2019re emphasizing including reward customers and revolvers other than high balance revolvers as well as the success of credit line increase programs.","The collective impact of these factors was greater than the continuing impact of our choice to avoid high balance revolver. Purchase volume on general purpose credit card, which excludes private-label cards that don't produce interchange revenue grew about 16% year-over-year.","Revenue margin for the quarter increased 13 basis points to about 17.1%. The increase resulted from expected seasonality and higher non-interest income partially offset by a decline in loan yield. Revenue dollars were down about 10% year-over-year driven primarily by our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio.","Non-interest expenses improve by $32 million from the prior quarter driven by operating efficiencies partially offset by a modest increase in marketing. We expect an increase in marketing in the second half of 2014 driven by both the expected seasonal ramp and because of the success and continuing opportunities we see in growing customer relationships, purchase volumes and loan.","On a linked quarter basis charge-offs and delinquencies were in line and continued strong underlying credit performance and better than seasonal expectations. The charge-off rate improved 49 basis points to 3.52% driven by seasonality as well as the diminishing impact of aligning HSBC branded card customer practices with Capital One practices the 30 plus delinquency rate improved 19 basis points to 2.83%.","Our card business remains well positioned we returned to year-over-year loan growth a bit earlier than expected despite continuing run off and our choice to avoid high balance revolvers. We are delivering strong sustainable and resilient returns and we continue to generate capital and solidify our customer franchise.","Moving to slide eight. The consumer banking business delivered another quarter of solid results ending loans grew about $335 million from the first quarter and declined about $1.2 billion from the second quarter of last year. One a year-over-year basis continued growth in auto loans was more than offset by mortgage run-off. Auto originations increased from the first quarter and remained on strong growth trajectory. Subprime originations were relatively stable while prime originations grew as we continue to capture additional prime share from our existing dealers. Ending deposit balances declined by about $2.4 billion in the quarter consistent with normal seasonal patterns. Year-over-year deposit balances declined about $640 million.","We had an abundance of deposits since the ING Direct acquisition and we've been allowing the least attractive deposits, the runoff.","Consumer Banking revenue increased about $18 million or 1% compared to the first quarter. Year-over-year revenues decline by about $66 million or 4% driven by the impact of persistently low interest rate on the deposit business declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto. Auto loan growth partially offset these negative revenue impacts.","Non-interest expense increased $28 million or 3% from the prior year. The increase resulted from growth in auto loans as well as a change in the geography of where we recognize auto repossession expenses, which are now included in operating expense rather than in net charge-offs.","Provision for credit losses increased modestly in the quarter at about $76 million from the prior year. The year-over-year change resulted from a swing in the allowance from release in the second quarter of 2013 to a modest build this quarter related to auto loan growth. Auto charge-off rate improved in the second quarter, driven by expected seasonal patterns in the higher proportion of prime loans in the portfolio.","Home loans credit trends remain favorable and continue to perform well inside of the assumptions we made when we acquired the mortgage portfolios. The overall consumer banking charge-off rate remains below 1%.","Our consumer banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing challenges. In auto second quarter growth and performance were very strong, but we expect that auto margins and returns will continue to decline as we move from exceptional levels to more cycle average performance. We expect that auto returns will be continue to be resilient and well above hurdle.","And in our retail deposit business, we expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low rate environment will continue to pressure returns even if rates rise in 2014.","As you can see on slide nine, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. Loan balances increased about 5% in the quarter and 18% year-over-year, driven by growth in specialized industry verticals in C&I lending and CRE. As competition continues to increase it\u2019s likely that the pace of our commercial loan growth will moderate over time.","Loan yields were stable in the quarter but declined 34 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by lower market pricing from increased competition and our choice to originate more variable rate loans. Revenues increased 7% from the first quarter and about 10% from the prior year. The year-over-year increase was the result of growth in loan and deposit balances across the franchise, partially offset by declining loan yields. The stronger increase in non-interest income was driven by the Beech Street acquisition and growth of fee generating businesses.","Non-interest expense was up 17% from the prior year as a result of growth in loan balances and continuing infrastructure investments to drive future growth. In the quarter, non-interest expense was up about 5%. We continue to closely manage commercial credit risk and commercial credit results remain very strong. Charge-offs, non-performing loans and criticized loans remain at exceptionally low levels that are not sustainable through the cycle. Commercial Banking competition continues to increase but we expect our focused and specialized approach to deliver strong results in the commercial bank.","I\u2019ll conclude my remarks this evening on slide 10. In the second quarter of 2014, we posted another quarter of solid results for the company and across our businesses and we continued to return capital to our shareholders as we execute our announced $2.5billion share repurchase program.","We're delivering these results in an operating environment that has both encouraging trends and continuing challenges. Credit remains relatively benign and our domestic card business is growing. On the other hand, the interest rate environment remains challenging and competition is picking up, particularly in auto and commercial.","Capital One is earning very attractive risk adjusted returns and we continue to focus on multiple levers to sustain our profitability. We'll continue to pursue growth opportunities in card, auto and commercial banking as growth remains a high priority. We'll maintain our long standing discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilience. And we will continue to manage expenses tightly in the context of investing to drive future growth, be a leader in digital banking and continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements.","We're on track to deliver 2014 pre-provision earnings of about $10 billion. We expect the 2015 pre-provision earnings will rise with growth in average loans driving increased revenues partially offset by a higher non-interest expense as we continue to invest to sustain growth and return. While the efficiency ratio will vary from quarter-to-quarter, we expect the full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be between 53% and 54% excluding non-recurring items.","Capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver superior and sustainable value to our investors. We continue to generate strong earnings and work actively to return capital to shareholders.","Now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?","Jeff Norris","","Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to see the other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow up questions after the Q&A session, Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Justin, please start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","","Hi, good evening guys. On the 2015 efficiency, the 53% to 54%, can you just give us some help understanding what type of backdrop you are assuming; are there expectation for rising interest rates; or any sort of acceleration in growth either in your loan portfolio or in the economy from the current levels?","Steve Crawford","","Yes Ryan, I think we gave guidance on 2015 on efficiency ratio and only gave guidance on that because we largely want to avoid forecasting other items. I do think it was important for us to express kind of what we think the potential is to drop additional revenues to the bottom-line as we move into 2015 but also to give you a real sense of what we think some of the investments are that we are making to ensure that we can sustain the returns we have which we think are very good and also grow going forward. So I mean you can see what\u2019s happening in general on loan growth around the industry. And I think we leave it up to you to try and figure out where you think that\u2019s going to go over the next 18 months.","Jeff Norris","You have a follow up Ryan?","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Thanks Jeff. You've obviously had some of the strongest growth that you've seen in quite some time and I take your point that we're likely not to see much in terms of the reserve releases going forward. But how should we just think about provisioning for growth? Should we think about charge-offs matching provisions from here or do you feel the reserve is at a good place and it could likely stay at the current levels?","Steve Crawford","Yes. Well, I think most people have been in the card industry have consistently assume that we\u2019re at the end of the period of improvement and they have been consistently wrong for a long period of time. We just thought like it was important to say with where charge-offs are, which is pretty historic levels that we would bet against additional reserve releases going forward.","I think a lot of people have continued to make that assumption over the last couple of years and they have been wrong.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","Sure. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Thank you. I guess Rich you mentioned that loan yields were a headwind to other positives for the card revenue margin. I was wondering if you can just help us think about loan yield on the new loans that are coming on relative to those that might be running off and maybe those that you were originating pre-recession or card act. Just wanted to try to get a sense of kind of how that's progressing?","Richard Fairbank","Well, I think Ryan. First of all I just do want to say just a contextual thing and your question may or may not have been simulated by that. Average loan yield is sort of it had some funny dynamics over the past several quarters and year-over-year it starts officially heightened because of the Best Buy held for sale in 2013, by the Best Buy held for sale accounting and so on. But if you kind of just get beyond some of the noise in the current movement and perhaps it\u2019s really better for me to speak in terms of revenue margin.","I think there is a striking stability in revenue margin that really goes back a number of years when you think back to revenue margin in 2011 was around 17% then in 2012 we added HSBC and adjusted for purchase accounting, purchase accounting margin was also around 17% and then in 2013 if you really normalized for the Best Buy impacts and deal related items revenue margin was kind of in the low 17% range. And we had some offsetting things that were going on there from the removal of Best Buy\u2019s low margin business roughly offset by a bunch of moves we made on things like payment protection, stopping the origination of that and some other kind of franchise enhancements. And we\u2019ve also said that I think on a calibration across all the businesses that we operate and I think the most stable business in terms of the yields and the margins in the business overall is the card business. And so unlike say on the other end if the continuum on the auto business where we say the new originations are definitely at lot lower yield and margin and then what the back book has.","I think the best way to think about it Ryan is that this, I mean Sanjay the front book has pretty strikingly similar kind of revenue dynamics to the black book. And I think that\u2019s really in many ways a reflection of the stability of our own business model and a reflection of kind of the relative stability of pricing in the card market.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","I think about sub-prime as a function of the total. I mean has that mix moved up in sub-prime, I mean is other opportunities in sub-prime that might not have been there a while ago?","Richard Fairbank","Some ways to more things change, the more they stay the same not to -- pretty similar to the revenue margin story that sub-prime mix in our portfolio stayed pretty similar. The FICO under 660 is been about a third of our outstandings in terms of like currently measured FICOs and that metric has been stable for an extended period of time.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura","Thank you. Good evening guys. Last quarter we saw relatively slower interchange revenue growth relative to your purchase volume growth, but this quarter we saw very strong than interchange revenue growth of 22% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. Can you give some color around that the dynamic that play here and talk about the sustainability of those trends?","Richard Fairbank","Yes. In the same way I cautioned when it was very poultry last quarter than it surges this quarter really kind of give you the same caution. In any individual quarter, the net interchange metric is -- I wouldn\u2019t put too much reliance on trend reading based on that. The net interchange metric first of all includes a bunch of things. It\u2019s got partnership contractual payments in it, it\u2019s got international card in it and we periodically adjust our rewards liabilities based on what we are seeing in terms of customer trends, redemption rates and things like that.","So and over the last few quarters as you say, net interchange growth has generally lagged general purpose credit card interchange growth significantly. But overall what we have said is that we expect the trend to have interchange growth lag general purpose credit card growth. We\u2019d expect this, a lag with some volatility quarter-to-quarter to continue. And let me explain just a little bit what\u2019s behind that.","Our rewards programs have been and continue to be very successful and we are also though in addition to aggressively marketing new rewards originations, we are also working to build our long-term franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers and extending rewards products to some existing customers who don\u2019t have rewards. And all of that means some near-term cannibalization but overall I think it really helps deepen the customer franchise. But those are facts I think will last for an extended period of time. So again, we feel very bullish about the ability to grow general purpose purchase volume, interchange should lag that with some quarterly volatility, but overall the economics of our rewards products, we feel very good about them. And what we're doing there is, over time we're building, growing that interchange revenue, additionally what comes with the territory of this business is the spenders build balances over time and they build finance charge revenues gradually over time and then you get the charge-offs for low attrition and kind of the long-term franchise dynamics is a whole thing.","So, I appreciate the call, because I think it's important to understand why the interchange does have a lag there relative to the purchase volume, but to our part it's something we're investing in and feel very good about.","Bill Carcache - Nomura","Thank you for that detailed explanation that dynamic, that's really helpful. If I could as a follow-up, do you believe that we\u2019re at a point in the recovery where perhaps the near prime revolver is finally starting to feel the benefits of what today many would argue has been a rather lop sided recovery favoring the affluent?","Richard Fairbank","I think that, I'm always a little cautious about using the recovery word. I mean this thing is if we're talking about recovery with a small r, I think in general certainly I think the recovery has been more manifest at the top of the market. But I think, yes, I would support the notion that I think we see across our business, some modest signs of some strengthening across the broader spectrum of the mass market. But I think these are all in the context of fairly modest effects at this point.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","And our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the PPNR guidance and the OpEx guidance and just understand does this suggest that there is going to be some degree of incremental operating leverage heading out into next year or are revenues and expenses moving up more or less in lock step?","Richard Fairbank","I think -- go ahead Steve.","Steve Crawford","Yes. So, I guess it depends upon what your frame of reference is. I think our GAAP efficiency ratio in 2013 was a little over 55%; the first two quarters of this year we\u2019ve been operating around 54.5%; and next year we\u2019re talking about somewhere between 53% and 54%. So, if you\u2019re defining operating leverage solely with respect to efficiency ratio, that number is going down over time.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, thanks for the clarity. And just a follow-up on the customer refunds issue. I think Steve you said that it\u2019s playing out a little bit differently than you\u2019d anticipated. I was just curious as to why you think that is?","Steve Crawford","It\u2019s just the submissions in terms of that they\u2019ve been coming down; they just haven\u2019t been coming down at the rate that we expected. There is a little bit different of a trend line which is why we increased the number by 37 million. And a big part of that could be that there has been a fair amount of media about PPI recently; that could be one of the things that kind of drove the increase.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","And the next question comes from Brad Ball with Evercore.","Brad Ball - Evercore","Rich, in talking about the growth that we saw this quarter, you mentioned three drivers: You said reward; non-high balance revolvers; and credit line increases. Can you give a sense as to which of those is driving the most receivable growth and are those the same drivers that you expect to drive U.S. card balance growth in the second half or will you be perhaps expanding the market to grow in the second half?","Richard Fairbank","Yes, I mean all three are important factors, I think that the investments in originating new account, all the efforts on originating new accounts be they on the top of the market side or in revolver other than high balance revolver. That has been a very study kind of growing thing. That is increasingly picking up traction and we feel good about that.","The credit line increase thing has been a little bit more volatile as you recall really going back to the beginning of 2012, there is a bit of a brown out related to that as we retooled our capabilities in the context of some regulatory guidance that came down about the need for having income before we did a credit line increase.","And the pattern of that is the problem solving to get solutions for that. We kind of got to a good place in the latter part of last year and then so we started initiating credit line increases on a growing basis around that time. And so part of the sort of surge that you see this quarter reflects that affect. It is not entirely -- it\u2019s not a one quarter little blip, there is actually continuity and continued momentum in that one as well. So but that one is a little bit more of a surge than the other two effects that are just very steady kind of growing effects.","Brad Ball - Evercore","Great. And then separately on auto finance you mentioned that prime grew this quarter from capturing share, I think you had said in prior quarters that you were seeing some increased pricing pressure on prime. What\u2019s the dynamic there and what\u2019s your outlook for auto finance growth in the second half?","Richard Fairbank","","Yes. So, it\u2019s a little -- you are a careful student of what we say because we have said as we have talked about the marketplace that the most competitive part of the credit spectrum is prime and that\u2019s really in fact in terms of margins at a near cycle low in many ways although the underwriting is generally healthy but the pricing is really tight. In the subprime space things are compressing but are still at a healthier play. So then kind of the question is so why are we flat in subprime and growing prime, it is what we are doing is deepening our dealer relationships. In our dealers where we have a very strong position and in subprime, we have a lot of opportunity to grow in prime. And it's really -- there are two things going on, one is I think we feel good on a standalone basis about the economics of the prime business, although it's certainly on the lower end of returns and by the way of losses of the various things that we do. But, I think the biggest benefit is the deepening of the dealer relationships and the benefits that come across the credit spectrum in terms of the quantity and quality of the deal flow that we get.","So, we feel, even as one time we've got a cautious eye on the pricing side on prime we feel good about this expansion that we just wanted to flag that most of the growth is coming, most of the incremental growth is coming on the prime side.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","And the next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup","Rich I know you've made some comments about card loan growth, but I just wanted to follow up. Is your sense that we'd be more likely to sort of keep out here in terms of industry card loan growth or do you think that we're potentially in an earlier part of the stage here?","And then secondarily, do you think any differential in terms of the health of the consumer on the lower or high end.","Richard Fairbank","Yes. So it's always hard, it's probably definitionally hard for anybody in the middle of these businesses to tease out the effects of industry growth versus one the growth that we ourselves are generating through our good innovation and marketing and so on.","I mean you can see we\u2019ve had some pretty striking sort of step forward here in the sense that going from I can\u2019t remember something like a minus 3% year-over-year to a low single -- now a positive growth number in card, despite all the stuff that we\u2019re running off. And as I look at it just from our kind of more narrow perspective I just see across all the things that we\u2019re investing in we went out spent a lot of time testing and we\u2019re rolling out on things that we\u2019re testing and we\u2019ve had a growing amount of innovation and we\u2019re rolling that stuff out and it feels, it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re just riding an industry tied up. I think this really feels very much like what we expected from the test that we did and the roll outs are performing very well and consistent with that and they\u2019re sort of expanding in that sense.","I am really pretty cautious to declare any kind of industry effect I\u2019ve seen for such a long period of time that the virtually zero and for a long time kind of negative growth in terms of revolving debt and of course I do want to say too as we continue to just stay so at the [sounding] performance on the credit side. We should all remember that this effect that has kind of exceeded the expectation virtually anybody out there I think is certainly one of the important factors there is the flip side of the consumer cautiousness that\u2019s holding back to growth.","So, I don\u2019t think as an industry we\u2019ll get a package of a bunch more growth and just still like record low credit. What I do feel is very good about our own growth programs that we\u2019ve steadily invested in and I think we've got good traction there and we hope to continue.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","Moving on the next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Bob Napoli - William Blair","Thank you, good afternoon. The private-label card business, I would just like some updated thoughts on that and what you're thinking about as far Rich about opportunities. Are you seeing more opportunities obviously Nordstrom, you\u2019re going to have a big file coming onto the market, you have a big competitor that's coming public, the GE capital spin-off, Synchrony I guess, just some updated thoughts on your opportunities if you're seeing more or less and excitement about that business?","Richard Fairbank","Well, gosh we certainly like the business. It\u2019s three to four, probably four years ago, we didn\u2019t have partnerships. So in some sense we\u2019ve come a long way since then with over 20 partners and $15 billion of outstandings. Of course the biggest single effect of that was the purchase of the HSBC business, but also before that we had pretty actively entered the market and going after top of the line players [Kohl\u2019s] being the flagship kind of partner there.","So our view of this business is, it is a real natural for Capital One, because we're already a big player in the card business. And I think this business is also crying out for innovation, whatever digital innovation any of us are thinking about in banking, if you want an industry that is incredibly they need of digital innovation, it is the retailing business and I think that that an opportunity to leverage business and I think that that an opportunity to leverage our own digital innovation and that space is very exciting to us. And what we are trying to do in that space is not -- is even though scale matters a lot and it definitely matters a lot and all you have to do is look at the loss of scale that came from our walking away from Best Buy to see some of those marginal economics; scale really matters. And so that\u2019s why we are very focused on growing. But I think each of the different players sort of has their different strategy. We are certainly trying to go more toward the higher end of the market in terms of the real quality retailers who are focused on building a franchise, deepening their customer relationships through the card as kind of the flagship and central nervous system of that transformation and that\u2019s really our sweet spot and I think where we can create a unique positioning.","You may have noticed that in an unusual move Kohl\u2019s with whom we already had a contract for many years still proactively went out and thought to extent that by another five years because they were so and again you have to look at their own words on this, but very happy with the relationship we are building and said that in order to really invest to build the long term franchise with us, they wanted an even longer commitment because they felt we were soul mates about leveraging the cards really build the franchise.","So that we see great promise in that business. In the near-term we have the challenge of that scale really matters and we are kind subscale. Yes, there are a lot of -- well there are several things that are sort of floating around in the market right now. And we will have to see how that thing turns out. But I really want to say that we still -- I still go back to the core principles that while growth really matters, what matters more than that is that we have quality partners who are motivated to do this for the right reason and a contract that really works. And where we find that, I think we want to be in a pole position to get those deals and I think over time, I like our chances.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","And the next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Great, thanks. Rich, I saw and I heard you say something about the deposit margins coming down, even if interest rates rise. Could you kind of go over that, because I wasn't sure I got that?","Steve Crawford","Yes, I'm not sure that that was in the comment. What I think he said which is not inconsistent with what I think the rest of our peers are saying is that even if we have a near term rise in interest rates, that doesn't mean that you'll be showing better spreads in the consumer banking business.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Got you. And would you say that the terms of the Kohl\u2019s contract are comparable to what they have been, because in the past, I mean your disclosures showed that you kind of remitted 90% of the revenues over to them. It's not clear what -- I mean maybe you could talk a little bit about what that partnership actually does for Capital One?","Richard Fairbank","Moshe, I don't know, if we want to get into the details of the Kohl's contract, I think that, I think both we and Kohl's have felt that economically this is a good program for both sides, in fact I think in acid test our partnership, is it really works economically for both side. And some of the elements of this are kind of structured a little differently from some of the other programs that are out there, but not in a way to have adverse economics for us it\u2019s just -- if you compare that structure to some others it\u2019s a different way that the revenues flow and the payments work. But underlying, it\u2019s a good program that with attractive economic opportunity for us and the renewal was while there were some changes in the terms, it was directionally along the similar lines.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","And the next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good evening. Question on the purchase volume; you had a nice increase there obviously year-on-year up 11% and up significantly from last quarter. Just you talked through earlier about the drivers to the increase in the loan balances, I am just wondering if you could kind of parse out the different drivers to the purchase volume increase by the different products, the clients types that you have?","Richard Fairbank","Yes. So, the purchase volume Betsy is and here I really speak about the general purpose card, obviously there is purchase volume growth going on, on the private label side, but we\u2019ve kind of more called your attention to the general purpose side since of course that\u2019s where interchange and the branded, the branded card business is for us. So, we talked about year-over-year growth of 16% which is even up on what we\u2019ve seen recently. The two effects that are going on is continued growth in the spender side of the business, both in consumer and in small business as a result of a lot of the marketing and customer experience work that we've been doing. And then also Betsy another factor that has boosted this is credit line increases and because of course what's happening is as people are selling their new credit lines, they're doing it through purchases as well. So that certainly added to this significant growth number.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","I know the credit line increases typically with (inaudible) strategy you've got increases primarily targeted towards the lower end of the customer and near-prime customers as opposed to prime customers. Is that the way the credit line increase has been going recently I mean giving effect [you to brown] I'm just wondering if credit line increases are across the board in terms of the quality sort of customer or are they still move likely to be skewed towards near-prime than the super prime?","Richard Fairbank","I mean our credit line -- so I am going to go back to what led us to have a bit of a brown out in line increases and that was this regulatory requirement that one needed a validation of income before one did a line increase. So our line programs work across our entire portfolio, there was more impact on the lower end because we tend to start with lower lines and then the mechanism and then there are more line increases to get to a destination than say where you to get a venture card you would be starting with a pretty high line.","So the differential impact was more on the lower side of the market of our portfolio, but really the effect and our roll out now of full capabilities and line increases is targeted across our whole portfolio.","Jeff Norris","","Next question please.","Operator","","Next will be Matt Howard with UBS.","Matt Howard - UBS","Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the expense guidance again, just going back to last year the original guidance was (inaudible) under $600 million decline or improving efficiency. I guess what\u2019s just changed as it just more opportunities you are seeing to take share or is there some other competitive dynamic that would suggest otherwise?","Steve Crawford","","Are you talking about -- I thought I heard you say expense efficiency?","Matt Howard - UBS","The operating expense, the previous guidance were forward to fall last\u2026","Steve Crawford","","So if it\u2019s operating, we really haven\u2019t changed our guidance for \u201814 what we did tonight was add a bogie for 2015. With respect to our original guidance for \u201814 all we have said is that we expect higher revenues and higher expense relative to our original estimate.","Matt Howard - UBS","Okay. And just in terms of the pre-provision guidance I thought you said sort of higher $10 billion but higher revenue offset by higher expenses. We just didn\u2019t know why the guidance were to fall year-over-year why would that have changed?","Steve Crawford","","The guidance for the efficiency ratio to fall?","Matt Howard - UBS","For the overall operating expense number.","Steve Crawford","","I am not sure I am following.","Matt Howard - UBS","I will follow up [offline]. Thanks.","Jeff Norris","","Next question please.","Operator","","And that will come Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","","Good afternoon thanks for taking my question. Just one question, Rich you mentioned in terms of the commercial loans a little bit of slowing in the loan growth there and I saw specifically in commercial real estate in the multifamily portfolio that was growing and annualized rate little bit about half of the rate of what you've done year-over-year. Is that from you are being tighter on underwriting or is that just a drop in demand across your markets?","Richard Fairbank","It's probably not technically either, we haven't tightened our underwriting nor have we loosened it. And I don't think demand is going down; if anything, I think demand is going up a little bit. I think -- but maybe I'm parsing words here, I think what's happening in some of these markets is that the markets are heating up in terms of competitive activity and some of the pricing in these spaces.","So, what we have done and then multifamily is a good example of that. We are very working hard to grow, but not by lowering our underwriting standards. We work really hard within the context of our standards to get all the business that we can. And one of the things that we've said in parts of the commercial business probably even more so on the C&I side, there are increasing evidence of some underwriting in pricing, softening in the marketplace on the C&I side, certainly the I think the impact on the institutional investor side of covenant light loans, things like this. This is slowly kind of spreading into different parts of the commercial marketplace and that is the biggest reason that we\u2019re saying over time this very significant growth rate that we have, we expect it to moderate just because we\u2019re holding pretty firm on the standards that we will accept for these loans.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay Rich. And then I just want to follow-up on the comment you made at a conference recently about selectively placing branches across your platform. Obviously, you have a number of markets where you already have reasonable branch density. I guess I am just curious at this point given your comments about thinking about branches, if you are more interested now than you might have been in the recent past about making very targeted acquisitions of branches in and\/or around where your branches currently sit.","Richard Fairbank","I think we are in a --- we\u2019re big believers frankly in being on the forefront of the digital revolution in banking and it is clearly sweeping the banking industry. And we\u2019re not just ideally kind of interested in it. You may have noticed that we bought ING Direct that had a very big investment in digital banking. What we have often said though is my perspective from one who\u2019s started out over 20 years ago to build the company that I thought would be a kind of direct only company, over time I\u2019ve really come to appreciate the benefits of physical distribution and face-to-face contact. What we\u2019re trying to do is work backwards from where that market is going as opposed to just try to go recreate what others have done in classic banking. And therefore I think putting in some light physical distribution in key metro areas is part of our future, but I think we're going to go about this trying to go with the market is going and not through the classic kind of go acquire across the country kind of thing.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","And our last question will come from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research","Good evening. I guess on back to the efficiency guide for 2015, I mean if I think back over the past few years, we've been on this kind of transitional period where there was the top bank initiative and scaling up to be one of the top five banks; and I mean I\u2019m sure so that goes along with that; there has been the merger charges; increase in tangible amortization which now running down. And so I guess as I think now, 53% to 54% in 2015 recognizing that no environment is ever really normal or the end game, but would you view 53 to 54 as a roughly normalized level of efficiency for the company or would you still view it as a transitional year to some ultimately lower level?","Steve Crawford","Yes. Look, I think if we were going to talk about something through the cycle, we probably wouldn't pick efficiency ratio, because you can pay dividends and return capital out of what your efficiency ratio is. So I think it's reasonable and we think about what the right through the cycle level of profitability is. There may be a point where that discussion we have. But if we do that, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be around efficiency guidance.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research","Fair enough. I guess as a follow-up and just a small thing. The jump in occupancy expense this quarter; is that a new run rate or was that just something that happened that was idiosyncratic to this quarter?","Steve Crawford","","No, that\u2019s probably closer to a new run rate.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research","Thank you.","Steve Crawford","","Nothing idiosyncratic there.","Jeff Norris","","Well, thank you very much to everyone for joining us on the conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, if you have further questions, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any questions you may have. Thanks again. Have a good evening.","Operator","","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norris","Thanks very much, Leanne, and welcome everybody to Capital One's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the internet. To access the call on the internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2019 results.","With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Scott Blackley, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Scott will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that the presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials.","Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. And for more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our Annual and Quarterly Reports which are accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Scott. ","Scott Blackley","Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with slide three. Capital One earned $1.6 billion or $3.24 per share in the second quarter. Net of adjusting items earnings per share were $3.37. Adjusting items in the quarter included $54 million of launch and integration costs associated with our Walmart partnership, and $28 million of restructuring charges associated with the exit of certain investing businesses. ","Slide 13 of our earnings presentation outlines the financial impact of these costs. In addition to these adjusting items, we sold several small partnership portfolios in the quarter, totaling approximately $1 billion of outstandings, which resulted in a pre-tax impact of $128 million or $0.21 per share, and included a gain on sale of $49 million and an allowance release of $68 million. This collection of partnerships generated about $160 million in annual revenue.","Relative to a year ago, adjusted pre-provision earnings declined 1% with revenue growing 4% offset by non-interest expense growing 9%, which was driven by higher marketing expense in the absence of a non-recurring adjustment to a vendor agreement this time last year.","Provision for credit losses increased 5% driven by a modest increase in charge-offs, coupled with a smaller allowance release in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Let me take a moment to discuss the quarterly movements in our allowance for each of our businesses, which are detailed in table eight of the earnings supplement.","Our card business saw an allowance release of $225 million, the release was driven by the strong economy and stable underlying credit performance, as well as the partnership sale I discussed earlier. In our consumer business, there was a slight release of $7 million, driven by our auto portfolio. Reserves in our commercial business increased by $66 million, primarily related to a handful of credits.","Turning to slide four, net interest margin was 6.8% in the quarter -- 6.80% in the quarter, 14 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. The year-over year-increase is largely driven by the lack of a couple of discrete events that occurred a year ago, including a build to our UK PPI reserve and the net impact of the sale of our mortgage business, which collectively were a 17 basis point drag on NIM this time last year. These factors were partially offset by higher average deposit costs as we continue to see strong growth in and mix shift towards our Capital One 360 Deposit products. Going forward, we continue to expect deposit mix to be a headwind to NIM throughout 2019.","Turn to slide five, I will cover capital. As previously announced, following the Federal Reserve's non-objection of our adjusted CCAR plan, our Board authorized repurchases of up to $2.2 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2020. And we expect to maintain our quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share, which is subject to Board approval. Our common equity Tier I capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.3%. In the near-term, we are well positioned to support the Walmart portfolio acquisition, organic loan growth, the phase-in impacts of CECL and capital distribution.","Based on company performance and the evolution of capital regimes, we continue to believe that our long-term capital need is around 11% CET-1. However, we will keep an eye on the impact and timing of the fed\u2019s tailoring and stress capital buffer proposals, CECL and the evolution of CCAR.","We are well along in preparing to adopt CECL on January 1, 2020. We have been running CECL models quarterly and working through accounting elections that we continue to refine. We expect to provide details on the impacts of adopting CECL in our Q3 call.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?","Richard Fairbank ","Thank you, Scott. Slide eight summarizes second quarter results for our credit card business. Pre-tax income was relatively flat compared to the second quarter of 2018. Year-over-year, growth in loans and purchase volume drove higher revenue, which was offset by higher non-interest expense. Credit Card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic card business, which is shown on slide nine.","Second quarter domestic card results include the impacts of our choice to exit several small partnerships that Scott mentioned. The exits and portfolio sales affected the optics of second quarter domestic card loan growth, revenue and allowance. Ending loan balances in our domestic card business were up $2.2 billion or about 2% compared to the second quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of the partnership exits, ending loans increased about 3%. The growth of branded card loans, which exclude all private label and co-brand cards continues to accelerate. In the second quarter branded card loans grew 4.7% from the prior year quarter. ","Year-over-year growth in new accounts and purchase volume was well above the growth in loans in the quarter. New account originations were very strong in branded cards, particularly at the highest end of the marketplace, as we continue to gain traction in our heavy spender franchise. Led by heavy spenders, domestic card purchase volume growth was 10% from the prior year quarter. Total company net interchange growth was 13%. Notably, we have been able to grow our spender franchise without sacrificing revenue margin. ","Revenue increased 7% from the second quarter of 2018, aided by a gain on sale of the partnership loans. Excluding the gain on sale revenue increased by about 5%. Growth in purchase volume and average loans drove the underlying increase. Revenue margin increased 57 basis points to 16.45% for the quarter, with 21 basis points of the increase from the gain on sale.","Non-interest expense was up about 21% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating expenses increased as we continue to ramp up operational capabilities for a smooth Walmart conversion and launch later this year and because the second quarter of 2018 benefited from a non-recurring vendor accrual adjustment. Marketing increased year-over-year, as we continue to see attractive market opportunities. ","Credit performance remain stable. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 4.86%, up 14 basis points from the second quarter of 2018. And the 30 plus delinquency rate was up 8 basis points. Pulling up, in the second quarter our domestic card business delivered strong results and continue to gain momentum.","Slide 10 summarizes second quarter results for our consumer banking business. Ending loans increased about 3% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans. Average loans decreased by about 10%, reflecting the trailing impact of the home loans portfolio sale in 2018. Second quarter auto originations increased 5% year-over-year, after several quarters of year-over-year decreases. The return to growth in originations is in fact a direct benefit of our investments in -- is in part a direct benefit of our investments in differentiated digital customer experiences.","Ending deposits in the consumer bank were up 5% versus the prior year quarter, with a 38 basis point increase in average deposit interest rate. Powered by the rollout of our national banking strategy, our strongest deposit growth is in Capital One 360 products, driving a product mix shift toward higher rate deposit products. Over the past year, the changing product mix, rising market interest rates and intensifying competition drove the increase in our average deposit rate.","From here we expect that faster growth in higher rate deposit products will continue to change our product mix. Our average deposit interest rate will depend on several factors, including our deposit mix, the market interest rate environment and competitive dynamics. ","Consumer banking revenue increased about 5% from the second quarter of last year. Growth in auto loans and retail deposits was partially offset by the revenue reduction from the home loans portfolio sale in 2018.","Non-interest expense was up about 4% compared to the second quarter of 2018, driven by marketing for our national banking strategy. Provision for credit losses increased $47 million from the prior year quarter, driven by a modest allowance released in 2019, versus a larger allowance released in the second quarter in 2018.","The auto charge-off rate improved compared to the prior year quarter to 1.09%, which is a large improvement to an unusually low level. Better than expected auction values and a benign economy continue to support strong auto credit. We continue to expect that the annual auto charge-off rate will increase gradually as the cycle plays out.","Moving to slide 11, I'll discuss our commercial banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances were up 6% year-over-year. Growth and average loans was 8%. Linked quarter growth was more modest with ending and average loans both up about 1%.","Commercial bank ending deposits were down 1% from the prior year. Average deposits were down 5%. Over the past year, commercial deposit customers have rotated out of deposits and into higher yielding investments in the rising interest rate environment.","Second quarter revenue was down 2% from the prior year quarter. Lower average deposit balances contributed to the decrease and the revenue benefit of higher average loan balances was offset by lower loan margins.","Non-interest expense was up 4% compared to the prior year quarter, as we continue to invest in technology and other business initiatives. Provision for credit losses increased compared to the second quarter of 2018. The largest driver of the increase was an allowance build, driven by downgrades to a handful of credits.","Commercial banking credit performance remained strong. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 0.09%. And criticize loan rates were relatively stable, compared to both the prior year and sequential quarters. The criticized performing loan rate for the second quarter was 3.1% and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.5%.","Pulling up, increasing competition from non-banks continues to drive less favorable terms in the commercial lending marketplace. We're keeping a watchful eye on market conditions and staying disciplined in our underwriting and origination choices.","In the second quarter, Capital One continued to post solid results as we invest to grow and to drive our digital transformation. Our marketing investments are building our momentum and creating great value. Our domestic card business posted strong year-over-year growth in new accounts, purchase volume and net interchange revenue. As we continue to gain traction with branded cards and heavy spenders.","In our consumer banking business, our national advertising brand and compelling digital experience enable us to post strong year-over-year growth in retail deposits without being the industry price leader. With the momentum we have in domestic cards and retail deposits, we continue to expect full year marketing for 2019 to be modestly higher than in full year 2018. With more normal seasonal patterns than the exaggerated patterns we saw last year. As always, marketing will depend on our continuous assessment of opportunities in the competitive marketplace.","And as I discussed last quarter, we are now in the seventh year of our technology transformation. We're building a technology company that does banking instead of a bank that just uses technology and our progress is accelerating. Our technology transformation is motivated by many benefits, faster to market, better products, better customer experience, better risk management, more effective operations, more growth, better efficiency.","We are already seeing significant benefits across the company. For example, digital productivity gains are driving operating leverage, since our journey began operating efficiency ratio has improved by 400 basis points, even as we have continued to invest in our transformation.","We are operating today with one foot in the legacy data center environment and one foot in the cloud as we continue to complete our cloud journey. As we migrate an increasing percentage of our applications and data to the cloud we have all those cost and at the same time until we fully exit our data centers we also bear the significant legacy cost as well.","We continue to expect that we will complete the exit of our data centers by the end of 2020, which should generate significant cost and efficiency improvement opportunities beginning in 2021. Until then, we will continue to drive for operating efficiency improvements even with the elevated costs of straddling both the data center and cloud environments.","We expect to achieve modest improvements in full year operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments in both 2019 and 2020. We continue to expect full year operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments to improve to 42% in 2021 powered by the exit of our data centers, continuing technology innovation and Walmart. And we expect this operating efficiency improvements to drive significant improvement in total efficiency ratio by 2021, as well.","As the many benefits from our technology transformation continue and increase, we are well positioned to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create long-term shareholder value. ","Now Scott and I will be happy to answer your question. ","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. Remember as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. And if you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be here and available after the call.","Leanne, please start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question fromSanjay Sakhrani with KBW. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. First question is on the interest rate environment and the broader market expectations of rate cuts. Scott, could you just talk about how we should think about the NIM trajectory in that backdrop. I know Rich spoke to the pressure from higher deposit funding costs. But just how you guys expect to manage through that?","Scott Blackley","Thanks, Sanjay. So as a reminder, I think we have said this many times that we really don't seek to bet on interest rate movements and we try to maintain a pretty neutral rate position relative to implied forwards. So from here I would say that a flatter or inverted yield curve is going to be a modest headwind to our NIM, on flip side of that a steeper yield curve is going to be a modest tailwind.","As you know, the yield curve flattened in Q2 and long-term swap rates are now down to around 2% and at that level of long-term rates. The flatter yield curve has created probably a few basis points of headwind to NIM in our full year 2019 net interest margin. So that's a little bit of where I see the interest rates impacting us.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And then my follow-up question on that partnership loss, was it a matter of misalignment between yourselves and the partner or is it sort of a reflection of a more heightened competitive environment? And maybe Rich, you can just speak to the broader competitive environment while you are at it? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank ","So I don\u2019t think there is any big significance to read into this. What I would say is with our digital transformation and where we are going in our card business, we are focusing more on partners that are industry leaders and scale players and we continue to be very excited about the card partnership business. And of course with Walmart coming on, we have a lot of momentum. We are continuing to build capabilities that differentiate Capital One from other players at auction, so that we can build a growingly valuable partnership business both for ourselves and for the partners who team with us to build their franchise.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","Good evening. Rich, could you talk a little bit about the auto business. Looks like the yields moved up and I know some of the peers that have been reporting recently that are big players in auto lending are talking about rates on new originations being higher than the current portfolio and having arguably some pricing power. Can you talk a bit about that?","Richard Fairbank ","I don't think we're struck by any significant movement in pricing power. I think we're at a pretty good place competitively in the marketplace. As you've watched our business and the conversation we have on all of these calls where we\u2019ll really see a bigger opportunity and there will be pretty sizable growth in originations, then the competition comes in either in magnitude and or in some of their practices and we kind of pull back a little bit.","I think we're in a fairly balanced place right now, I'm not struck by a change in the margin opportunity, but if you -- but just sort of the feel of the marketplace, I think there is a -- there is some growth opportunity. And I think the other thing that we're struck by in Capital One's case at least is the strength of the some of the credit results that we have been seeing. And we're pleased by that.","Don Fandetti","Okay. And just real quick follow-up, the Fed looks like they're going to cut rates do you think that'll have any impact on the card business from a focus on revolver versus transactors. I know that when rates moved up, you did see some change in behavior.","Scott Blackley","I don't think -- are you talking about a change in behavior in our customers, or in terms of the focus that we have in our\u2026","Don Fandetti","Yes, just a change in the focus on revolvers versus transactors. I know when rates moved up there was a little bit of a shift over to revolvers. I didn't know if you thought there would any change from that perspective.","Scott Blackley","Yeah. Over the whole range of interest rates that we've -- the range of interest rates we've had for the last significant number of years, I don't think it's led to real pivots by us relative to transactors or revolvers. I think we are very -- as you know, we're leaning into the opportunity at the high end of the marketplace where we're getting a lot of momentum with the franchise that we're building and these are long-term stable, very low attrition, very valuable annuities and we're capitalizing on that opportunity. And sometimes in our conversations, we talk more about that.","But meanwhile on little cat feed, if you will, we continue to just keep plowing ahead very consistently on the revolver side of the business. And frankly, the growth of -- the continued really strong performance in new originations is not only a top of the market phenomenon, and we continue to have strength across our -- across the transactor and revolver side of the business and this gives rise to growth opportunities as we -- on the revolver side as we grow the -- as customers grow their balances and as we extend higher lines over time.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rick Shane with JP Morgan.","Rick Shane","Guys, thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Hey, Rich, you spoke about the traction in the spender market. I am curious, given the strength in labor and wage growth and frankly low gas prices, how you feel about the middle income consumer? And is that an opportunity that perhaps you should have leaned into a little bit harder over the last year? And will you -- is that something -- is it appropriate to lean in now? ","Richard Fairbank ","Yes, I think that our -- we've had a very consistent strategy for an extended period for a long time relative to the revolver part of the marketplace, which is, one where in this extended recovery is one that I think continues to post strong credit results.","We, if I pull up about, what we -- how things have varied in the last few years. So, we had a significant growth surge in 2014 through 2016. And we all watch a lot of the metrics that Capital One changed significantly. We saw that -- we saw signs of - some signs of concern in the industry vintage curves, gapping out a bit in 2016. And our own results were consistent with what we saw in the industry. We pulled back on originations and certainly launched a more conservative approach toward credit lines. ","Since then, Rick, we have seen -- we\u2019re very pleased with the vintage results that we have seen in 2017, what it looks like 2018. So, there is certainly a strength there that that we note, and it is that that is leading us to open up a little bit more gradually on the credit line side, which is a contributor to the gradually increasing loan growth. But along the way, we have continued to really go for the opportunity in growing new accounts. It's been the sort of the -- our lever of -- the lever that we have dialed is how significantly to open the credit lines, and how quickly to move them.","The actual origination machine has stayed at a sort of wide open over that period of time, and we're getting particularly strong results in the last 12 months in that.","Rick Shane ","Got it. Yes look, I understand hindsight. 2020 and it's easy for my seat to say that and objectively we thought the growth surge that you guys experienced in 2014 and 2015 was a big catalyst. It is interesting to sort of think about it moving forward as well.","Richard Fairbank ","Yes, the other thing Rick is there, I think if you stand back and look on an absolute like-for-like normalized basis, while 2016 had -- we saw the most impact across the industry in terms of things gaping out. On an actual like-for-like basis originations keep normalizing a little bit and exact on a like-for-like basis, the credit losses are a little bit higher. Now capital we are very pleased with our vintage, the vintages of our originations and the choices we made on line increases. With part of that strength comes from the dialing back around the edges that we've had.","And the other thing I want to say is that it's not lost on us. We just -- we, America just broke the record for the longest sustained recovery. We are deep into the cycle. And so our biggest focus is on underwriting for resilience. And -- but in the meantime, we're really pleased with the strength of the originations and we continue to unleash some of that in terms of loan growth on the credit line side.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.","Eric Wasserstrom ","Thanks very much. I just wanted to circle back on the provision explanation for a moment, if I could. I was just looking at the past several quarters worth of the credit loss and provision coverage history. And the losses have gone up at a very moderate pace, a few basis points over the past five, six quarter. But looks like the coverage has come in a bit with this release in this period and just hoping you could give us a little more color on what drove that change in forward expectation in light of that very moderate decline in asset quality over the same timeframe?","Scott Blackley","Well, a couple of things. So in my comments, I mentioned that we've seen very stable credit performance and then an economy that just has continued to really roll forward and it's just a combination of those things honestly as you know in our portfolio, given its size, small moves there can generate $100 million release. So you think about the release in card a good portion of that was related to the sale of the several of the small partnerships that we talked about and the remainder was just driven by the ongoing strength of credit and the economy. ","Eric Wasserstrom ","Okay. And if I can just follow-up on that point, does that imply some sort of -- I mean, the ongoing strength. I guess I'm trying to understand whether that ongoing strength implies to you that you think credit losses will improve from here or just continue at this sustained pace of small incremental deterioration.","Richard Fairbank ","So our viewpoint that is that credit performance that we see is basically flattish and there are number of kind of small effects, offsetting effects, different things that are idiosyncratic about the drivers that make variation off of flat, but on a seasonally adjusted basis things look pretty flattish for us. As we look at other metrics like delinquency flow rates they look strong, they look stable. We of course do have some continued benefits from growth in that being a good guy quietly in the background and I think overlaid on top of all of that that\u2019s probably underlying a little bit of normalization in the current business. And I think in our case there kind of these moderate effects are offsetting pretty much to a draw. So I think things are pretty stable and of course we always have to remind ourselves where we are in the cycle. ","Jeff Norris","Next question, please. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. I was wondering you mentioned I think for the first time you talked about the growth rate of your branded card portfolio at 4.7% and what had that thing growing at an you alluded to the process that you\u2019ve talked about a few times in terms of kind of seasoning the accounts a little longer before increasing their credit line and maybe if you could, just talk a little more about because we\u2019re kind of approaching about a year since you started adding those accounts. And so is it reasonable to assume that that 4.7% would be accelerating from here?","Scott Blackley","So we pointed out the branded metric because partly there has been some things that have been modestly affecting the metrics in the other direction on the partnership side and also of course a lot of the marketing we\u2019re spending, the franchise we\u2019re building that directly is in service of the branded card business that we\u2019re building. So you can see -- well basically while we are not giving historical metrics on those things that that branded card metric is also picking up and it is the primary area that is getting the benefit of the significant surge on account originations.","So I think with every passing quarter we\u2019re opening up a little bit more on the credit lines, and hopefully we\u2019ll continue to have strong account originations. And the combination of those two can be a good guy for the growth in our branded card business. ","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. Could you -- I mean, was that number 100 basis points lower if you went back six months? ","Scott Blackley","Yes, I don't -- we're not going to give the retro numbers, but it has tended to be stronger than the one minus is the branded card in recent periods. And it is growing nicely. ","Richard Fairbank ","Yes, Moshe, I believe, last quarter week gave the metric on the call at just a little over four.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it, okay. Thanks.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. ","Ryan Nash","Good evening, guys. Rich, the industry was able to significantly lag on the way up on deposit pricing, but you've had a lot of banks building out all sorts of digital deposit taking capability. So outside of the negative mix shift that Scott talked about, what are your thoughts on banks like Capital One and the industry's ability to reduce deposit pricing on the way down? And I have a follow-up question.","Richard Fairbank ","I think it is a great question. I'm not going to often I\u2019ll stick my neck out and make predictions. I think here there's certainly an industrial logic for it. We've seen a few of the direct players, three of the big kind of nine direct players have made a move downward, which is noteworthy. And I think the choices that are made by each company is going to be very much dependent on their particular situation, what is their need for deposit growth and what other kinds of pressures are they facing.","But I certainly -- I've always thought it's ironic that people talk about deposit betas as if beta is the number that's the same size on the way up and the way down and a lot of people model things with a number called the deposit beta, but the first thing most intuitively is the betas have to be different on the way up and the way down. And they're going to probably be different for direct players than they will be for regular players.","But I'm heartened Ryan by some of the dynamic moves that we're seeing in the marketplace. But I'm not ready to predict that players will have much movement downward, I think it's going to be harder for -- well certainly the biggest banks don't have anywhere to go because they really didn't chase the rates up regional banks maybe are kind of in between relative to the direct banks and the big banks. But we'll have to monitor this closely. And your question is a good one. ","Ryan Nash","If I could ask just one follow-up, so the stock is trading just above 1.15 times tangible book value for a company that's putting up a high-teens return on equity. What do you think the market is missing about the resilience of the business model or the efficiency opportunity, from the digital transformation over the next couple of years? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank ","Well, thank you, Ryan. I think that Capital One is in a very great place in terms of the opportunities that we see, headline by the digital opportunity. And it is very clear inside our company and you're starting to see some manifestations externally that our tech progress is accelerating and the benefits, which extend across a lot of different aspects of the business from speed to market to product quality, customer experience, risk management, operational effectiveness, growth, efficiency, there's a lot of different aspects of it and it's not all going to manifest itself in a big bang, but we feel we can see traction accelerating in many places.","Now, how that translates into valuation, is very much probably related to also how investors feel about a consumer stock and a consumer lending stock at this time in the cycle as well. So, with respect to that side of the business, Ryan, we -- the number one thing that drives our underwriting is not reaching for growth opportunities. It's a focus on resilience. And I think this served us very well on the last recession we underwrite as if a recession is upon us.","And, I, very much like the resilience of the business that we're booking but I think investors still carry concerns about that. And I think that affects valuation. But if you see a bounce in my step, if you see some -- here the energy in the sort of spit flying passion with which I described this thing. I've been building this company for -- this is the 25th anniversary this year of our IPO in 1994. And I must say that the period we're in reminds me in many ways of the early days of Capital One with the just some really nice opportunities to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and to make a real impact on customers and build a franchise.","And how that makes its way into valuation is one thing well I'll have to look at. But the thing that we focus, most importantly is on getting it to make its way into the metrics of earnings and growth and returns themselves.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin St. Pierre with KSP Research.","Kevin St. Pierre","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Rich, I believe you had mentioned that the majority of the deposit growth was coming through the Capital One 360 products. Some of the other large banks have incorporated mobile and digital slides into their presentations where they give us statistics on mobile users and transaction. I was wondering, if there are some successes, some numbers that you could share with us, both on the mobile front and the Capital One cafes, and even some numbers behind the Capital One 360 products?","Richard Fairbank ","Kevin, we -- there's a lot of traction in all the metrics that you mentioned, we haven't -- I think for a certain competitive reasons have not chosen necessarily to lay all of that out. But directionally the growth in mobile users. The metrics, I've seen at Capital One at the top of the league tables in terms of growth rate of mobile users and dangerously close to the top of the league table in terms of total mobile users, which growth rate and magnitude if they're both at the top that augurs pretty well. ","So on the 360 side, of course, there's -- what's sort of unique about Capital One is that we really have sort of two different banks. We're a combination of a local bank and a direct bank. And we've built overtime a strategy that's more of instead of running around with two businesses, it's more of a fusion of the two.","That said, our metrics continue to be sort of a blend of the performance of the two. But what we're really excited about is the power that comes from building a single phase and a single brand and a single franchise that tries to combine the best of what local banking has, but -- and the best of what a more pure digital bank would have. And we are very pleased with the early results. And we continue to be bullish about the opportunity there.","Kevin St. Pierre","Just following up on that, and maybe also following up on Ryan's question and commentary. I think, if you are at the top of the league tables in terms of mobile users mobile growth, and you could potentially show us that, I'd respectfully say that that might solve a little bit of the valuation issue if you can show that you are slugging it out with the big boys punching above your weight on the mobile digital front, I think that could only help. ","Just a quick follow-up, maybe if you could speak to the preparations for on-boarding, Walmart, both in terms of servicing -- preparing for servicing the customers, as well as any changes you're planning to the structure of the product.","Richard Fairbank ","So, we remain excited and on track, with respect to the launch of the Walmart partnership, and the conversion of the back book, both of which are slated for late third quarter, early fourth quarter. We are working closely with both Walmart and synchrony in this complex conversion, both are being good partners in this conversion. With respect to products and marketing plans, we're going to -- we have nothing to announce on that. But as you can imagine, we're working very hard. And we look forward to our launch date.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Two questions, one a little more of a modeling question. But I just wanted to confirm the portfolios that you sold was that at the end of the quarter? I'm just wondering and I think Scott, you mentioned $160 million of annual revenues associated with the portfolio. And is that in -- is that out of the 2Q run rate, or do we start that from 3Q and maybe you could give us a sense of the expense ratio we should align with that?","Scott Blackley","Yes, that was at the end of the quarter. So that run rate is going to start in Q3. And in terms of efficiency, I don't expect that it's going to have any meaningful impact to the overall efficiency ratio. ","Betsy Graseck","Okay, so same efficiency, okay. And then just wanted to hear what your thoughts were with regard to some of the new competitors that are going to be coming in, I mean we've got Goldman and Apple that are planning on launching a car in the next couple of months. And they've been very vocal about looking to go with a low cost to the consumer solution, no fee and low interest rate. I mean, we'll see what those rates look like when it gets launched, because clearly it's a marketing pitch right now, we don't have any data to back that up. But that's the plan.","So Rich, I was just wondering how you think about that type of new entrant coming in? And, if there was anybody other than Apple, maybe -- or I don't know, maybe it doesn't matter that it's Apple, but just wondering how you think about that? And you mentioned earlier, how you're really underwriting as if a recession is upon us at all points, which makes a lot of sense, and it serves you well, I'm just wondering, do you think that there's any challenge or risk that that could get up ended in a new competitor coming into the market like this?","Richard Fairbank ","Yes, Betsy, it certainly gets our attention when pretty much anything that -- let me start with Apple, anything that Apple does, gets our attention, because they and the other big four consumer tech companies are whether they say it or not are certainly focused on the -- by the way, they don't want to become banks. They are plenty happy, I think to led banks be banks, they're interested in really controlling the front end of banking, which is really the customer interface, the customer experience, that's where the eyeballs are, that's where the interaction is, that's where the data is. And that's where -- that's the less regulated side of the business as well.","So that certainly, as a general point, always has our attention. And I think the tech companies bring a lot of natural assets to the table and they're certainly have good technology. It also gets their attention and players like Goldman Sachs, build a consumer business. Because I think Goldman's a great company and they starting from scratch building a consumer business. I think have done a nice job with what they've done.","So I think I don't have any predictions to make about this, I think, it's nicely put together with nice marketing. And, I would expect Apple and Goldman to be successful with what they're doing. ","As far as we're concerned, we continue to go all in transforming our company from a tech point of view. And that puts us in a position to have great digital customer experience. And","I'm very bullish about our opportunity, even as others step up their offerings and their competition. ","Jeff Norris","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jeffries.","John Hecht","Afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. Can you guys spoke about being somewhat neutral from a rate environment perspective in terms of the NIM. But then you did highlight that your deposits might reflect a headwind for the remainder of the year. I wonder, can you give us, I guess, some color around what type of NIM pressure that might reflect and the cadence of that?","Scott Blackley","Yes, John, we've been signaling that deposit mix and at least during the period where we were seeing rates rise, even some of the deposit rates were putting some pressure on NIM. As you can look at our kind of the movement of our NIM quarter over quarter over quarter for a while, you can see that it's been drifting down just a little bit each quarter. And so that's a little -- just to give you a sense of the trajectory there. I think that, these aren't really significant headwinds, but it's just a pretty much a consistent few basis points every single quarter that we're seeing as pressure.","John Hecht","Okay. And then, just to -- I guess a follow up, tied to that is, how do we think of -- you had a pretty big growth in deposits during the quarter? How do we think about the overall deposit strategy? What's kind of the maximum in terms of the composition of deposits you'd want for liabilities? And how much mix do we -- should we expect in the 360 product?","Scott Blackley","When you think about deposits, we have a relatively high ratio of loan to deposits. So we would love to be able to continue to grow our deposit base. We tried to make sure that we have access to all of the wholesale funding channels that we can. We also take advantage of commercial deposits where they are appropriate for our liquidity profile.","So, when it comes to just where we hope to be on our direct bank deposits and our local bank deposits, and we think that's an opportunity for us to continue to grow. We think we're really well positioned with the products and the digital tools that we have out there in the market. And so, I would expect that we'll be able to continue to see growth in that area of funding of the bank.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please.","Operator","And our final question this evening comes from John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari ","Good evening. On the -- on your operating efficiency ratio expectation to reach 42% by 2021. I know that excludes marketing spend, can you talk about over that period how you think about the trajectory of marketing spend just given the competitive dynamics in the business? Or I guess another way to ask it, you expect that improvement to 42% to improve the total efficiency ratio for the company. Maybe can you give us an idea the magnitude of improvement in the total ratio that you expect?","Scott Blackley","Yeah, John. The reason that we gave our long term guidance on operating efficiency ratio and not total -- I mean, we did give one on total efficiency ratio, but it was less specific than the operating efficiency ratio is because the operating efficiency ratio is there are a lot of dynamics happening in our business.","And in our quest to keep driving down operating efficiency ratios that these effects are, colloquially put baking in the oven. And, what's happening with Walmart and the move to the full revenue share at the end of 2020, for example, that there's an economic change that happens. And also, that's when we're going to be fully kind of in ramping on the front book of Walmart as well.","Then we've got the data center exit, and the timing of that continues to be relatively certain. And we can see the economics that, by the way, don't just happen automatically the economic benefits, but with tremendous efforts to make sure that they happen, we can see that baking in the oven. And there is some other technology innovation, that is in the works that collectively happened to line up around that time period.","And given that we have been spending a bunch of money on technology, our investors have had a lot of questions about technology, and one of the many benefits of the tech transformation is the opportunity to really significantly improve operating efficiency. We shingled ourselves to that.","The marketing is not something that we would lay out our shingle about what it's going to be wanting two and three years from now, that's very much going to be based on what we see in the market at that time. And the opportunities we have to build a franchise, how much traction that we are having in the upper end of the marketplace where a lot of the marketing is directly focused.","And -- but we also didn't want to just exclude that from the conversation because obviously to investors in the end, total efficiency is the thing that drives the bottom line. And that's why even with the kind of range of outcomes that can have on the marketing side, our point was that we think total efficiency ratio can significantly improve by 2021.","John Pancari ","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Scott Blackley"," Thank you.","Jeff Norris","Well, thank you everyone for joining us on our conference call today and thank you for your interest in Capital One. Remember the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great night.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norris","Thank you very much, Mandy. Good morning, and welcome, everyone to Capital One's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.","As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2012 results.","With me today are: Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Gary Perlin, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Gary are going to walk you through this presentation. And to access a copy of that presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors and then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements.

Rich?","Richard D. Fairbank","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin tonight on Slide 3. Second quarter results were driven by purchase accounting impacts and a greater than usual number of other items. Gary will discuss the financial impact of these items in a few minutes. We posted second quarter net income of $92 million or $0.16 a share. We completed the acquisition of the HSBC U.S. Card business on May 1. We're thrilled to welcome the customers and associates of the HSBC U.S. Card business to Capital One. We have now completed both of the acquisitions that we announced in 2011, and we're devoting all the necessary focus to sure-footed integrations to realize the significant value of the deals.","We still have a lot of work to do on integration, but both integrations remain on track. We continue to believe that both transactions are financially and strategically compelling and we remain extremely excited about them.","By 2013, we expect that the combined Capital One, ING Direct and HSBC businesses will deliver attractive financial results and strong capital generation. We'll continue to provide information on purchase accounting and merger-related impacts to help bring these underlying trends into view during the second half of 2012.","The second quarter also reflects a number of other items beyond the expected impacts of purchase accounting. We made significant additions to our reserve for representations and warranties on mortgage loans.","In our U.K. business, we experienced additional revenue and expense impacts from claims related to the industry-wide settlement related to the sales practices of Payment Protection products. Our Domestic Card business had 2 significant nonrecurring items in the second quarter. We, along with numerous other banks, were a party to the interchange litigation and the settlement agreement announced last week. The terms of the settlement have been widely publicized. We are reserved for the monetary components of the settlement, including the temporary reduction in interchange rates. While we'll have to see how the resulting changes from the settlement play out in the marketplace, we don't anticipate a long-term impact on revenues or our business strategy.","We also announced yesterday that we've reached an agreement with the OCC and the CFPB to resolve previously disclosed issues related to our oversight of vendor sales practices of payment protection and credit monitoring products to Domestic Card customers. Between August 2010 and January 2012, Capital One's third-party vendors did not uniformly adhere to our sales scripts and the explicit instructions we provided to agents for how these products should be sold. We are accountable for our vendors' sales of products to our customers and we take that obligation very seriously. In this case, we did not monitor our vendors' performance closely enough. We deeply regret any process breakdown that impacts our customers. When it happens, we fix it and make it right. When we first learned of these breakdowns, we immediately stopped all sales of these card add-on products. We identified impacted customers to provide full refunds. As the order lays out, we decided to refund money to approximately 2 million customers who purchased the product during this period. We made this decision notwithstanding that many of the vendors' sales calls did not raise concerns and we're strengthening internal quality control processes and our monitoring of vendors. We have no intention to sell these card add-on products in the future because the economics of our Credit Card business does not depend on revenues from add-on products and we have a lot of opportunities to grow our franchise in other ways.","A couple of our retail partnerships still sell payment protection through long-term contracts. Looking through the significant noise in the quarter, the strong underlying performance of our businesses continues to demonstrate that we are well-positioned to deliver sustained shareholder value.","Slide 4 provides an overview of solid business results in the quarter. While HSBC purchase accounting dominates second quarter Domestic Card results, the underlying business excluding HSBC deal impacts continued to deliver strong performance. Excluding the HSBC loans and the continuing run-off of closed-end loans, domestic revolving credit card loans grew modestly in the quarter. Purchase volumes also continued to grow compared to the second quarter of last year. Revenue margin remains strong in the 16% range excluding HSBC deal impacts, but including the negative effect of the cross-sell settlement. Credit trends remain stable at historically strong levels with normal seasonal patterns. All told, the Domestic Card business delivered another quarter of strong underlying net income. We expect that Domestic Card growth margin and credit metrics will continue to be affected by HSBC-related items we discussed on the first quarter earnings call. HSBC impacts include: Expected run-off in parts of the portfolio; alignment of customer practices; HSBC's historical charge-off levels; and of course, the effect of acquisition accounting. But even with several quarters of these deal-related impacts on metrics, we expect our card business to deliver strong and resilient profitability and a valuable customer franchise.","The Consumer Banking business posted an exceptionally strong quarter. Ending loans were up modestly with Auto Finance growth outpacing expected mortgage run-off. Average loan growth was stronger with the full quarter effect of ING Direct mortgage loan balances.","Deposits declined modestly. Revenues were strong, driven by higher average loan balances and a modest decline in deposit interest expense, which were partially offset by lower loan yields from the full quarter effect of ING Direct mortgage loans.","Credit remains strong with seasonal tailwinds in Auto Finance. Net income was $438 million. Our Consumer Banking business continues to gain traction with national scale auto lending, local scale in attractive local markets in retail banking and growing national reach with the addition of the ING Direct franchise.","Our Commercial Banking business continues to deliver strong and steady overall performance. Loans grew 3% in the quarter at 15% year-over-year. Revenues were stable compared to the first quarter and up 13% year-over-year. And credit performance continues to improve. Commercial Banking delivered $228 million in net income for the second quarter. We expect the strong and steady performance of our Commercial Banking business to continue.","I'll conclude my remarks this morning on Slide 5. Capital One continued to deliver strong results in the second quarter of 2012, and we remain focused on delivering sustained shareholder value. Because the ING Direct and HSBC U.S. Card acquisitions are such key sources of shareholder value, we're committing all the necessary management time and talent to executed sure-footed and effective integrations. We're also building a great customer franchise. Capital One is already one of a handful of banks that is building a very large and very loyal customer base. ING Direct brings 7 million loyal, early digital adopters with attractive demographics and HSBC has 20 million -- excuse me, 27 million active U.S. credit card accounts. So the acquisitions will strengthen and expand our combined customer base. Over time, these customer relationships are a tremendous source of value as we can expand and deepen customer relationships with new products and services. We've made great strides in delivering a franchise building customer experience, and we expect to preserve and leverage this simple, compelling ING customer experience as we continue to build a great customer franchise across all our businesses. The combination of Capital One, ING Direct and the HSBC U.S. Card business puts us in an even stronger position to create sustained shareholder value through growth potential, strong returns and strong capital generation. We're focused on delivering that value, including distributing capital to shareholders through meaningful dividends and opportunistic share buybacks consistent with our long-standing commitment to maintaining a strong and resilient capital base.","Now I'll turn the call over to Gary to discuss our financial results in more detail. Gary?","Gary L. Perlin","Thanks, Rich, and good morning to everyone on the call. I presume that most of you have had a chance to review in some detail the financial results we published yesterday afternoon. So I'll limit my opening comments to the highlights and a couple of issues that may benefit from a bit of additional explanation.","Starting with the balance sheet on Slide 6, you can see that approximately $31 billion in cash was paid to HSBC on May 1 for its U.S. Card business. On that day, we recorded about $27.6 billion in loans held for investment. The difference reflects the other net assets we recorded in purchase accounting, which are described on Slide 7.","Acquisition accounting starts by separating the HSBC card loans into those which are non impaired and as revolving loans are accounted for under FAS 91, and those which have lost revolving privileges and are considered impaired. The impaired loans are accounted for under SOP 03-3. About 95% of the loans acquired were non-impaired. We posted a $1.2 billion loss allowance for these loans as of June 30. In addition, we added $174 million to our finance charge and fee reserve with respect to these revolving loans, which, as you know, is recorded as a contra-revenue item.","We anticipate modest additions to both these items in the third quarter. Consistent with FAS 91, we also booked a fair value premium of $692 million on these revolving loans at the time of acquisition. This loan premium will largely be amortized through the end of 2013, including $63 million in the second quarter. For the remaining 5% or so of HSBC's loan balances accounted for under SOP 03-3, we established a credit mark of $666 million. This mark absorbed $251 million in loan losses during the second quarter and the balance should largely be drawn down by losses over the balance of the year. The largest ongoing impact of purchase accounting will be the amortization of PCCR, a $2.1 billion intangible asset associated with purchased credit card relationships. PCCR amortization was $85 million in the second quarter. We expect this number will be somewhat higher the third quarter, owing to a full 3 months effect and will continue to amortize on an accelerated basis over 9 years. PCCR amortization, like all acquisition accounting effects from HSBC, will be allocated to our Domestic Card segment.","Slide 8 breaks out the impact of the HSBC Card acquisition on the second quarter, including the acquisition accounting-related entries described on Slide 7, plus transaction and merger-related expenses and the impact of 2 months worth of HSBC Card operations. It's worth remembering that only $10 million of the approximately $260 million in charge-offs related to HSBC loans hit the income statement in the quarter, since the vast majority of such charge-offs were recorded as a reduction in the credit mark for impaired loans I just described. In addition, revenue also benefited from the absence of $45 million in finance charge and fee reversals that were absorbed through the noncredit component of the SOP 03-3 mark.","Among the other items, which affected the Q2 income statement, I'll focus on 2. As Rich noted, we announced regulatory settlements related to cross-sell marketing in our Domestic Card business. $60 million in civil money penalties were recorded in noninterest expense. We also announced that, pursuant to our agreement with the OCC, we were setting aside $150 million in cash to fund expected customer refunds. The total income statement impact of these expected refunds totals approximately $116 million, including a $75 million reserve accrued in the first quarter to reverse previously recognized revenues and an additional $41 million reserve this quarter to reflect the final terms agreed with our regulators. Additionally, we are no longer recognizing revenue for any amounts billed for these products to affected customers. Currently, we continue to bill for products sold to these customers to ensure continuity of coverage for the products until they receive their refunds later this year. This includes approximately $24 billion of build amounts in the second quarter that were not recognized.","The other item I'll mention is the accrual in the second quarter for litigation reserves to cover the interchange settlement that Rich described and other settlements in the second quarter. We have also recorded the effects of a variety of other smaller settled and pending matters, including one we expect to resolve in the coming weeks. As we've been saying all year, 2012 results will reflect a considerable amount of noise due especially to merger-related impacts. While some of those impacts will persist for a while, as indicated in our discussion of the acquisition accounting, we continue to believe the new run rate of our combined businesses will become visible starting in the back half of this year.","Turning to Slide 9, let's touch briefly on net interest margin. Reported NIM for the second quarter was 6.04%. The negative impact on loan yield from a full quarter impact of ING Direct mortgages was more or less offset by a positive impact from the partial quarter impact of HSBC card loans. The modest contraction in NIM on a linked-quarter basis was primarily driven by a decrease in Domestic Card loan yields, primarily as a result of the $174 million finance charge and fee reserve build arising from acquisition accounting as I described earlier. The decrease in asset yields was partially offset by lower cost of funds in the quarter, largely driven by the full quarter impact of ING Direct's deposits. We expect NIM will rebound significantly from here as we experience a full quarter effect of the acquired HSBC Card loans. The longer-term outlook for NIM will, as with most banks, depend on asset mix and especially on the outlook for interest rates.","Before ending, let me quickly cover off on capital on Slide 10. As of June 30, our Basel I, Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.9%. Risk-weighted assets rose substantially in the quarter as a result of the HSBC Card acquisition and related acquisition accounting results in -- that caused our Tier 1 common capital not to rise as much. Our Tier 1 common ratio came in slightly higher than expected, largely as a result of the considerably lower level of goodwill created as a result of the HSBC card acquisition compared to our prior expectations. We continue to be comfortable with our strong capital levels and our capacity to generate healthy amounts of capital going forward, which Rich discussed earlier, is an important element in Capital One's ability to deliver sustained shareholder value.","With that, Rich and I would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I just had a quick clarifying question on the add-on products. Were they sold in the first quarter? On that $24 million, is that a good run rate of what will not reoccur on a go-forward basis? And then I guess, secondarily, just on the private label portfolio, that shrank a little bit relative to deal announcement and even since you've acquired it. Could you just talk about your expectations going forward, in terms of growth and maybe the same for the broader portfolio?","Richard D. Fairbank","Okay. Sanjay, I think the -- probably a good round number estimate for the ongoing impact of this -- the foregoing revenue of this tranche of customers is about 10 basis points, on an ongoing basis, a declining function but when I look out next year, for example, that's the kind of neighborhood of the revenue impact. So -- and again, there are 2 revenue impacts, just to call to your attention for a second. One is the loss revenue from the customers we're remediating. That's the round number of 10 basis points on the Domestic Card revenue margin. And then, we will forego revenues related to future sales of payment protection and credit monitoring because we've chosen to stop selling the products. And the revenue impact of this choice is harder to predict because as we learned over the last few years, credit margins are really driven by competitive dynamics in the marketplace once you get there. On the private label partnership portfolio, there were over 20 partners in this deal. And some partners, through the process of closing this deal, have -- we have separated from several of those. Nothing that's a really material impact there. And this phenomenon of assessing each partner and making sure that our partnerships, as we continue to renew all these contracts over time, are focusing on really great partners that are very focused on making the private label credit card a centerpiece of their franchise. That's where we're going. So we feel very excited about the partnership business. And as a general update, I mean, I think things are going very well with our early relationship building with the partners and getting -- and we're basically reviewing one contract at a time and many of these contracts are multi-years and like free agents, there's always a few free agents coming up every year. We've got a couple of more still working on but overall, I think we're off to a great start with the partnership business and we look forward to growth opportunity in that business. And then you would -- go ahead. You want to talk about growth overall?","Gary L. Perlin","I wanted to just make one other mention here, Rich. This is Gary, Sanjay. The other thing to keep in mind and you saw it over the course of the last year, as our partnership book started to build, prior to HSBC, with Kohl's and other partnerships, there is an exaggerated amount of seasonality in balances in a lot of these retail partnerships. They tend to ramp up more at the end of the year. And in the first and second quarter, you see them run-off a little bit faster. So keep that in mind going forward as our partnership book starts to grow.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Brendler of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a question: you reported, I think, the spending growth in the quarter at 11%, including Kohl's, I believe it was mid to high-teens last quarter. Anything unusual in spending trends or are you just seeing a pronounced slowdown among your card customers?","Richard D. Fairbank","No. I mean, there's a pretty strong seasonality effects with respect to spending. But no, I don't think we see anything overall of note. I think we continue to see really strong traction with respect to our new transactor focus products and we -- the spending numbers that you see are a blend of retailer numbers and the private label and the general purpose credit card spending on our portfolio as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Don Fandetti of Citi.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Rich, I just want kind of talk a little bit about the business, the card business in terms of competition. I mean, we've been talking about the banks moving to the affluent for quite some time here. When we talk with bank executives, they seem to highlight the Basel II RWA inflation and the low end of the credit spectrum. It looks like you're the only large bank focused on that particular part of the credit spectrum. Can you sort of talk about what the larger banks might be missing and could you see increased competition over time if those banks realize that they are not as profitable as they hope to be?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, Don. I think your observation is one that we also see. It seems that most of the card competitors are moving out of the middle end and upper end of subprime of the marketplace. And why would they do that? I think, for a number of them, the CARD Act, they found kind of altered their revenue model in a way that made that business for them less profitable. And again, I can't speak for them. But when we reverse engineer some of the things that -- the way their model worked and how it was changed by the CARD Act, that I think is one thing that started the migration. Secondly, there's, I think, been a lot of pressure on banks to try to migrate to places with lower capital pressure. And I think that Basel II, it's very clear that Basel II creates a greater tax on businesses like that. Because Basel II, unlike many risk management frameworks, including things like stress test, Basel II taxes, if you will, based on loss rate, not on the relationship between loss rate and loss under stress and revenue coverage. And so that really kind of undermines some of the -- really, from a risk management basis, sort of a little bit of a misalignment of capital allocation versus how that business really works. And so I think a lot of folks, while they have headed for other places in the business, what we've been saying all along is through the CARD Act, through the great recession and in our forward planning, we still are mostly where we were before. With respect to the CARD Act, which we were, I think, very embracing of the underlying level playing field associated with the CARD Act, we've -- you can see from our numbers, our business model is pretty intact. On the other side of the CARD Act, Basel II will be higher tax that we have to pay and, of course, we are looking closely at that. But I think that the performance of this business over the years of our experience through the great recession and even now with the other pressures on it, I think, for us, we continue to believe that what we used to do is the same business model I think is really going to work going forward. The other thing I think some of our competitors found is some pretty big losses in parts of this business where, I think, financially and in terms of our credit performance, it weathered it better. So as we've said many times, the more things change for Capital One, the more they stay the same. Where we play and how we do it is pretty much the same as it was going into the great recession.","Operator","We'll go next to Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Couple of things. You had mentioned that when you looked at the Domestic Card business X the deal that the revenue margin was 15.8%. What are the items that were actually embedded in that when you looked at that? And then also, 3 months ago, after the first quarter, you had talked about the HSBC portfolio at maturity kind of having an effect on the entire portfolio of raising the loss rate and lowering the revenue margin by certain amounts. I'm wondering if you're still -- if those are still your forecasts or how you think about that?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes. So let me talk about the loss rate first, that's the simplest one. HSBC, when it comes in, because of the marking of the delinquent customers basically, as you know, Moshe, dramatically lowers the loss rate until that -- for basically a couple of quarters. And then it bounces up to its running rate. We said at the time, Moshe, that would be in the neighborhood of 75 basis net increase in the otherwise legacy Capital One running rate. I think, if anything, that's a conservative number. Conservative, meaning that it's probably going to come out on the inside of that. So as we bring HSBC on its books, we've been impressed with its loss numbers that are coming in on the -- little bit on the inside of our own estimates for them. And I think we feel it's very solid books. So something probably more -- in the 40 to 60 basis points is probably more of a revised kind of view on that. But again, that's still an increase to Capital One's otherwise card charge-off rate. With respect to revenue margin, the 15.8% second quarter card revenue margin I was talking about, excluded -- excuse me. Go ahead, Jeff.","Jeff Norris","Moshe, the 15.8% is what we reported. If you exclude the HSBC impacts, that rises into the 16%. And if you exclude the cross-sell reserve, that would be closer to 17%. So the 15.8% sort of includes the noise, if you will, on all of the items in the first quarter. And what the point Rich, I think, was making was that, excluding the HSBC impacts, still in the 16% range. And that's loaded with the other item related to the cross-sell reserve.","Richard D. Fairbank","Okay. And with respect to the impact of HSBC on our card revenue margin over time, we had highlighted that at the time of the deal decision, a key part of our due diligence was to review all of HSBC's practices and to estimate what would be the cost of bringing those practices in line with some of our practices that we had -- for choices that we have made on some of our consumer practices. And we have said, for example, talking about it last quarter, that on a phased basis, over the first and second quarter of 2013, we would be bringing those practices in line and that would be a net impact on our combined card portfolio of 30 to 35 basis points of running rate. So that, Moshe, we're in the same place we were last quarter when we made that announcement. And to be clear on these things, we're not really in the revenue margin guidance business. What we tend to do is quantify some of the revenue margin effects that we see are coming in the business, for example, the 10 basis running rate impact that we talked about a few questions ago, as well as the 30 to 35 basis point impact from the HSBC reconciliation of practices.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Taiano with Telsey Advisory Group.","Michael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","I guess, first question I had on mortgage Rep and Warranty, are the claims you're seeing there, are they more coming from the GSE side or from the private label trust, both the insured and noninsured?","Gary L. Perlin","Mike, it's Gary. What we are seeing has virtually no GSE impact on it. Let me just remind you that we announced last quarter that we had reached a global settlement, both on the pipeline on future Rep and Warranty claims, from one GSE where the bulk of our exposure in that space came from. So this is largely coming from the insured securitizations and other private securitizations areas.","Michael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. And then just a second question. I know you guys don't want to get into the habit of giving guidance. But I guess, now that these 2 deals have closed and you're getting your arms around and integrating them, and do you see yourself at some point either later this year or early next year giving us guidance in terms of what your capital ratio expectations are or just broadly sort of return and\/or growth expectations? I know some of your peers have done sort of longer-term on average over time, I was wondering if that's something you guys would consider.","Gary L. Perlin","Yes, Mike, it's Gary again. I mean, I think, with respect to future performance trends, what Rich and I have said is that after the considerable noise that we had this quarter, which I'm glad to see that people have been able to kind of look through based on the disclosures we've made, that as the year goes on, hopefully we won't need to give you guidance. You'll see within our performance, the underlying strength of the business and the future is more likely to depend on things outside of our control, whether it's credit or loan demand or whatever the case might be and the future will depend a lot on that and you'll be able to make your own judgments. But I think in terms of our own base revenue generation capacity, our continued focus on expense management and so forth, I think you'll see that run rate emerge as the year goes on. With respect to capital, it's probably a longer-term story because as you well know, we will become a Basel II bank at the end of this year. Most of the other Basel II banks have already been in that program for the better part of the decade. So it's understandable that they have a more refined view of how that affects them. Certainly, as Rich indicated directionally, we know that we will have an increase in risk-weighted assets. But we also have a very strong capital generation outlook on any measure. So it's one of the reasons that Rich and I have both said that we believe that even as we get on a trajectory that allows us to meet any requirements going forward, we believe that we'll be in a strong position to be able to include capital management as an important part of our shareholder value proposition. Exactly what those numbers will be will emerge over time, but I think that trajectory will be quite clear.","Operator","We'll go next to Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just a simple question. Concerning the economic backdrop, what you have now in terms of these deals integrated, do you stand behind the accretion guidance you gave us when you first announced these deals together?","Richard D. Fairbank","Craig, that may be a simple question, I can't say it's necessarily a simple answer because as you suggest, the world is quite different today than it was when we announced these transactions in the middle of 2011. Our base trajectory is obviously going to be affected by that. I think the key drivers, however, of value in the deals are still there. The synergies we're seeing play out already. In terms of the ING Direct transaction, you can see the continued improvement in our deposit cost, which I think is definitely a benefit and particularly, at the time of lower rates, the fact that we have more variable costs in our deposit franchise is helping us quite a bit. And with respect to HSBC, both the nature of the business, the quality of the book, the quality of the people on both deals when it comes to the quality of the people, that's very much intact. And most of the synergies from HSBC are really being reflected already because many of the costs that applied to the HSBC Card business, when they were part of HSBC, did not come over. And so I think it is still our belief that these are very compelling transactions in terms of financial and strategic value. Exactly how I calculate any particular metrics today versus where we were last year, I think, is an exercise that would be a challenge for any bank to hold firm on any particular number. But the quality and value is absolutely there.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just to ask then in clarification. How does -- in your mind, how does the trajectory for asset growth feel versus when you announced the deals?","Richard D. Fairbank","Well, I think on asset growth, Craig, let's remember that with HSBC, I think the difference was that the actual quantity of loans acquired on the day of close was a little bit lower than we had anticipated. Some of that is seasonality, some of it were a couple of partnerships that Rich described. But we indicated from day 1, we thought that there'd be a little bit of run-off in that book. In terms of ING Direct, we said that the mortgages were likely to begin to run off and be replaced by other assets being generated by other parts of Capital One's business. But we felt that there'd be a good strength in the deposit franchise. And in fact, although our overall deposits -- our deposit volume was reduced in the second quarter, there was actually an increase in balances among ING direct depositors. So I think that, relatively speaking, the performance of both of the acquisitions on the growth front is not materially different than what we would've anticipated. If you could have told me a year ago exactly what the economic situation would've been today, I might have had a different view about overall growth in the industry. But I think our position there continues to be strong.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you give a little bit of color on the differential between the 11% purchase volume growth that you're seeing and the 1% loan growth?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes. I mean, I think, Phil, the 11% purchase volume growth is -- or Bill, the 11% purchase volume growth is driven by the -- first and foremost, driven by the marketing campaigns and the investments that we're making in going right after the heavy spender part of the marketplace. We also -- that also includes partnership data and we have -- and are continuing to build partnerships with retailers that are doing well and are getting some strength with respect to purchase volume as well. And even finally, there's another effect that, over the last couple of years, what I've been saying, we're getting -- while we're not building balance transfer-focused originations, we are really building sort of more old-fashioned accounts where you get a credit line and then use it over time. Some of the purchase volume growth also is the building of balances on some of these coiled spring originations that we have built as well.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, and finally, Rich, could you give us some perspective on, given some of the boom and bust cycles that we've seen over the years in the auto finance space and the strong growth that you're seeing there, could you just kind of frame for us what you guys are doing from an underwriting perspective to kind of ensure that, in the next cycle, that these loans aren't going to be ones that will end up driving significant losses for you at some point down the road?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, well, we all -- bankers always vow that when they go through the recession, they vow that never again and all the other banks that we've all heard and somehow, history tends to repeat itself sometimes. So what I want to say is that first of all, just to comment about the Auto market, it does have very strong growth right now related to, I think, pent-up demand from the great recession. It's a very healthy kind of industry dynamic right now. Some people were scared away from the business. Supply and demand is in pretty good shape right now. There are a lot of good things going on and used car prices are at record highs. Now all that said, that's nice. But also, when things like used car prices, which is the price of collateral and lending is at record highs, that should get people's attention. So let me tell you what we have done. First of all, we have done a retro look way back through the great recession and how the industry gradually loosen standards and sort of what would have happened had we never gone down that path and -- well, it's a hypothetical because you're not -- you can't be sure that you'll get the volume of business in relationship businesses. If one doesn't adapt, frankly, it's really striking how well the business would've done in that early stage where we lost money had we more firmly held our ground and that is a lesson that is deeply written into some of our underwriting practices. But let me also say that we underwrite to significant recessions, that's what we do at any point in the cycle. So we are assuming that there is a huge reduction in used car prices starting the day after we originate any loan. I think that has been an important part of this thing. A lot of our lending practices are also driven by where are we in the cycle. And one of the most important things to be is on the lookout for where the inflection point comes, which is the precursor to a boom, which is the absolutely worst part of the lending cycle. We are not there -- and we look by industry -- by business for that. We are certainly not at that point yet in the Auto cycle. And I think there's very good business to be had. But the main thing is we are taking very conservative choices on underwriting. And we are assuming significant recessions in hardwiring that into the underwriting decisions. And the most important things that we will have to watch, which is the 2 competitive effects is: One, the loosening of standards; and secondly, the reduction of pricing. And where that equilibrium is right now in the Auto business is pretty good. But we all know from history, those things can change and we're all over it and I appreciate very much the spirit of your question.","Operator","We'll go next to David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I wonder if you could just clarify what you said about the information -- some of the information on Slide 8, the revenue and the non-interest expense from the HSBC business excluding all the one-time items. That expense number then annualizes, I guess, at about $1.5 billion or so. Is that -- are you saying that that's kind of a normal run rate and that contract you have with HSBC is included in that and that we shouldn't expect much in the way of declines over the next year if you -- with any of the integration?","Gary L. Perlin","David, I'll give you an answer to start out with, as I did last quarter when we try to break out of this information for the impact of ING Direct, which is this is less designed to give you a perfect view of the future and more designed to give you clear comparables between our second quarter with the partial quarter effect of HSBC and all the purchase accounting versus the previous quarter. That said, let's remember, so you have to adjust for the timing here, with respect to the revenue, it's slightly -- it's about where it should be because we've stripped out the purchase accounting effects there. The expenses are not a bad indicator of where they might go. The important difference that you need to keep in mind is that there is virtually no charge-off expense, no provision expense in that. And then, of course, going forward, the one thing that you will continue to see is the presence of PCCR amortization in that number. And of course, there will be some integration expenses that will continue in that number as well. So I personally would not use those numbers as an exact run rate. Certainly for the next couple of years, where PCCR amortization and integration expenses will continue. But other than that, and making sure that you put in a more normal level of charge-offs and a normal level of finance charge and fee reserves, it puts you into a reasonable ballpark. But this is not intended to be an absolute directional set of data about where we're going. But it does kind of start to give you the ability to see the outlines through the fog.","Operator","We have time for one more question, Rick Shane from JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have 2 quick questions. One is a follow-up to the last one. When you announced the HSBC transaction, implicitly, there was about $1.5 billion of operating expense there. And to David's point before, that's what's implied roughly from these numbers here. You talked about $350 million of operating expense synergies, which I assume were basically between the HSBC portfolio and the core Capital One portfolio. Do you still think you're on track to deliver that?","Gary L. Perlin","It's still kind of early in the process, Rick, we're still working on the integrations. And obviously, some of the synergies are going to come from scale and other things, but we're already seeing a substantial amount of it because of the costs that did not come over. And I think, in general terms, the value that we saw in that transaction at the beginning is pretty much what we would have expected. And again, just make sure that you realize that for a period of time, we're still going to have PCCR and integration expense coming out of that. So if you net out that, I think you'll start to get close to the kind of the cost synergies that we described in the announcement.","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then really changing gears. Related to the cross-selling settlement, will you consider seeking indemnification against the partners who led you down that path?","Richard D. Fairbank","No. At this point, we don't have comments to make on that.","Jeff Norris","Okay. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this morning on the conference call. And thank you for interest in Capital One, and the Investor Relations staff and I will be here throughout the day to answer follow-up questions that you may have.

Rich?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. Capital One earned $810 million, or $1.54 per share, in the first quarter. Excluding adjusting items, we earned $1.75 per share. Pre-provision earnings for the quarter were $3.1 billion and we posted strong year-over-year loan and revenue growth across our businesses. I'll begin tonight's call by discussing the major themes that are driving our overall first quarter results and our outlook for 2017, Domestic Card credit and total company efficiency ratio.","Based on portfolio dynamics and industry conditions we observed in the first quarter, we now expect that the full-year Domestic Card charge-off rate will be in the high 4%s to around 5%, with quarterly variability. That is up from our prior expectation of the mid 4%s. With the benefit of more data, we have refined the expected shape and timing of credit losses on our front book programs booked over the last few years.","Our originations in 2014, 2015 and 2016 remain highly resilient. Even with our revised charge-off guidance, we continue to expect that these vintages will drive earnings for years to come and generate total NPVs at the high end of all the annual vintages we've booked since the early 2000s.","Over the past year and a half, we have seen increasing competitive intensity, a growing supply of credit and rising consumer indebtedness. As we move through 2016, we tightened our underwriting around the edges. Our actions over the past four quarters have led to a deceleration of our growth, just as the industry is accelerating. We still think there is a growth window, but the window is gradually becoming smaller.","I want to turn now to another important driver of financial performance and that is efficiency ratio. We have been working very hard to enhance the efficiency of the company as we grow the business and invest in our digital transformation. Over the past two years, we have lowered our annual efficiency ratio by nearly 200 basis points to 52.7% net of adjustments. We are continuing to drive hard for efficiency gains. We are converting customers to digital, using technology to simplify and automate our operations and driving out analog costs.","On the third quarter earnings call last year, we guided to a near-term annual efficiency ratio in the 52%s, net of adjusting items. We are now seeing the opportunity for even more progress in the near term, so we are revising that guidance. We now expect annual efficiency ratio for 2017 will be in the 51%s, net of adjusting items and plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility.","Efficiency is a key way that the investors will get paid, and we will continue to drive hard on this lever. Over the longer term, we continue to believe we will be able to achieve additional efficiency improvement, driven by growth and digital productivity gains.","On the earnings calls in each of the past two quarters, we have stated that we believe we are in a position to deliver solid EPS growth in 2017, assuming no substantial change in the broader credit and economic cycles. The higher expected charge-offs and related allowance impacts put pressure on expected EPS this year. But the improved efficiency outlook partially offsets the earnings impact from credit.","While there is a lower margin for error and based on what we see today, we should be in a position to deliver 7% to 11% adjusted EPS growth in 2017. It's important to note that all of the guidance we're discussing on tonight's call excludes the potential impact of the announced Cabela's transaction.","So now I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss first quarter results for the company. Scott?","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Thanks, Rich. I'll begin tonight with slide three. As Rich mentioned, Capital One earned $810 million, or $1.54 per share in the first quarter. Excluding adjusting items, we earned $1.75 per share. We had one adjusting item in the quarter, a $99 million build in our UK Payment Protection Insurance customer refund reserve of which $70 million was an offset to revenue and $29 million was captured in operating expense. A slide outlining adjusting items and adjusted EPS can be found on Page 13 of the slide deck.","Pre-provision earnings were up from the prior quarter, as slightly lower revenues were more than offset by lower non-interest expenses. Efficiency ratio in the quarter was 51.6%, excluding adjusting items. Provision for credit losses increased from the prior quarter, driven by both a larger allowance build as well as higher charge-offs. An allowance roll-forward by segment can be found on Table Eight of our Earnings Supplement.","Let me take a moment to explain the movement in the allowance across our businesses in the quarter. In our Domestic Card business, we built $441 million of allowance. This build covers the loss forecast change for 2017 that Rich just discussed.","In our Consumer Banking segment, allowance increased $61 million in the quarter, almost entirely driven by growth in our auto business. Looking ahead, in our April monthly credit results we expect a one-time increase in charge-offs of approximately $30 million due to accounting changes in the timing of charge-offs of bankrupt accounts, which I discussed in our last earnings call. For the year, accounting changes will increase our auto businesses charge-off rate by approximately 20 basis points. These losses were fully provided for in our 2016 allowance.","In our Commercial Banking segment, we had a $32 million reduction in reserves, driven by the impact of continued improvement in our oil and gas portfolio. Recent reserve movements have been focused in our taxi and oil and gas portfolios, and we have provided details for those portfolios on slides 15 and 16 in the Appendix of the slide deck.","As you can see on slide four, reported net interest margin increased 3 basis points in the first quarter, to 6.88%, as higher rates and mix benefits more than offset day count in both linked quarter and year-over-year comparisons.","Turning to slide five. As of the end of the first quarter, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 10.4%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.3%. We believe that we are now at the destination capital ratios appropriate for our current balance sheet mix.","And with that, let me turn the call back over to Rich. Rich?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Thanks, Scott. I'll begin on slide nine, with first quarter results for our Domestic Card business. As I discussed earlier, loan growth and purchase volume growth decelerated in the quarter, but remained strong. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $6.5 billion, or about 8%. Average loans were up $7.9 billion, or about 9%. First quarter purchase volume increased about 7% from the prior year. Revenue for the quarter increased 7% from the prior year. Higher revenue from loan growth was partially offset by revenue suppression associated with higher delinquencies and charge-offs. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.3%.","Non-interest expense increased just under 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Our Domestic Card business continues to gain scale and improve efficiency. Charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.14%, up 48 basis points from the sequential quarter. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.71%, down 24 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. In the first quarter, delinquencies began to turn down on a seasonal basis.","Pulling up, we continue to be concerned about the supply of credit in the marketplace. Revolving credit grew at about 6.5% year-over-year, the seventh consecutive quarter it has grown much faster than household income. Against this backdrop, we have been tightening our underwriting. We still see growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business, but our growth window is gradually getting smaller.","Slide 10 summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans grew about 5% compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about 6% versus the prior year. First quarter auto originations were $7 billion, with strong growth in prime, near prime and subprime. Competitive intensity in the auto finance marketplace softened a bit, which contributed to our growth.","While we still see attractive opportunities for future growth, there are also reasons for caution in the auto industry, including declining auction prices and an increasingly indebted consumer. Based on the competitive environment we see today, we expect to increasingly emphasize price and margin over volumes in our origination strategies. Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices. And we dialed back on some less resilient programs even as overall originations have grown. As the cycle plays out, we expect the charge-off rate will gradually increase and the growth will moderate.","Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter increased about 6% from the first quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was partially offset by margin compression in auto. Non-interest expense for the quarter increased 5% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing. First quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, primarily as the result of charge-offs and additions to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio.","Moving to slide 11, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. First quarter ending loan balances increased 5% year-over-year as we continued to grow in selected industry specialties. Average loans increased 6% year-over-year. Higher average loans as well as higher non-interest income in our capital markets and agency businesses drove revenue growth of 11% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Non-interest expense was up 21%, driven by growth, technology investments and other business initiatives.","Revision for credit losses declined $230 million from the first quarter of last year, primarily as a result of the change in allowance as well as modestly lower charge-offs. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 14 basis points. Criticized and non-performing loan rates were relatively stable in the quarter. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.7% and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 1.2%. Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil field services and taxi medallion portfolios. We've provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves and other metrics for these portfolios on slide 15 and 16.","I'll close tonight by recapping the key themes driving our outlook for 2017. We expect the full-year Domestic Card charge-off rate for 2017 to be in the high 4%s to around 5%, with quarterly variability. We expect total company efficiency ratio, net of adjusting items, to be in the 51%s, plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility. And we expect the improved efficiency outlook will partially offset the earnings impact from our revised credit outlook. While there is a lower margin for error and based on what we see today, we should be in a position to deliver 7% to 11% adjusted EPS growth in 2017.","Pulling up, we are struck by the amount of change that is coming in the marketplace and the opportunity to capitalize on that. We have invested heavily in transforming our company and driving growth opportunities. We are well on our way to rebuilding our infrastructure with a modern technology architecture and along the way we are redesigning how we work. We are delivering resilient growth across our businesses. We are driving improving efficiency. And we're building an enduring customer franchise and our momentum is growing. We continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive growth and returns as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.","And now Scott, Steve and I would be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Just in terms of the card growth outlook, what is the implication of that for rewards and marketing expense, Rich? Is there some possibility that perhaps that starts to plateau or even decline?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","So, Eric, we continue to be very positive about the success of our marketing and, frankly, the growth of our spender business. In fact, frankly, the growth of all of our business. But my comments about gradually dialing back around the edges from an underwriting point of view is entirely related to the competitive environment and its impact with respect to credit and revolving credit and the choices that we make there.","The rewards business is \u2013 the top of the market spender business is a very competitive business, but we continue to be successful. Our actual growth rate in spenders and heavy spenders continues to be very good number there. And so we will continue pretty much the way we are going with respect to our marketing and growth plans.","My only point, and I don't want to overdose on this point because, in many ways, it's a gradual continuation of something that we've been doing probably since the beginning of 2016, and that is just dialing a little bit around the edges of our programs in response to what we see is an increasing amount of supply out there and increasing amount of indebtedness. So we're still going hard for growth. Even, frankly, on the revolver side of the business, we think there are good growth opportunities. Our point is just that this is a continuation of a trend that's now, frankly, five quarters along.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right. Thank you for that. And just one follow-up, please in auto. The issue of residual values is one that's been talked about quite a bit. And one of the theories postulated in this quarter was that the delayed tax refunds were causing there to be incremental pressure on used car values in the period. Any legitimacy to that in your view?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Well, we have ourselves speculated about that. I don't think we have a good way to know that. Our own observation has been just kind of pulling up on the used car values, Eric. While the Manheim Index has stayed pretty high, it's starting to fall now. We have always created our own index based on the cars that we deal in. And that metric was moving down earlier and farther than some of the metrics that people were looking at overall in the industry.","With respect to, therefore, shall we say, the Capital One Index of used car prices, we have been expecting that to go down. We underwrite assuming it'll go down actually quite a bit and stay down. That's an underwriting assumption. But even in terms of our own forecasting, it dropped below our forecast decline rate in the first quarter. So that certainly got our attention.","Eric, well, it's too early to know whether that might have been related to the tax thing, but we will see. But it certainly underscores a very important thing to monitor in the auto business. And really, at the top of our list, frankly, in the auto business is used car values and the fact that for so many years they've been so high. In some ways, they only had one way to go from here.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good evening, guys. Maybe I could start off with credit first. Rich, just what drove the net charge-off guidance change? Secondly, should we be using the $7.21 adjusted EPS from 2016 as the base for 7% to 11%?","And then, look, I know it's very preliminary, but just given that a lot of the growth from 2014 and 2015 are likely starting to peak out in terms of losses, 2016 obviously we'll get through a decent bulk over the next couple of quarters. Just wondering if you'd give us any sense for where you would expect charge-offs to go from here, given the fact that we have undergone growth math now for the better part of two-plus years.","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Right. So, Ryan, a bunch of questions there. First of all, with respect to the base upon which you calculate the EPS growth.","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah, Eric, this is Scott. Table 15 of the Earnings Supplement has the schedule that shows the adjusted EPS, and you'll see the full-year 2016 and it is $7.21. So you're correct in that.","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","And Ryan, relative to growth math, yeah, let me just talk about growth math and how that relates to the revision in the outlook that we have talked about tonight. So this revision is entirely related to the front book of Capital One, the growth book that is from 2014, 2015 and 2016.","And so think of it this way basically, this is playing out from a slightly higher base than we had earlier expected, but the underlying dynamic is exactly the same. So right now we're near the peak of the growth math effect in terms of the year-over-year impact on the loss rate of our card business. That impact moderates over the rest of 2017, with only a small tail in 2018.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","That will be from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks. And along with the guidance on charge-offs, Rich, could you talk a little bit about how you see the reserve? Because there seemed to be a little bit of a disconnect this quarter compared to previous ones, given that you had both a slowdown in the dollars of loan growth and slowdown in the dollars of delinquency growth and yet the provision \u2013 the reserve was built. What's the outlook for that? How long would you need to maintain that extra reserve given the comments you just made about the tail of charge-offs?","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah, Moshe. it's Scott. Going to the reserve, as you said a couple times, there's really three components of the reserve loan balances that are as of the end of the period, our loss expectations for the next 12 months and then qualitative factors for risk and uncertainties.","The biggest driver in what drove the Domestic Card allowance build in the quarter was the updated credit outlook that Rich discussed. So that was the primary driver. And then there's also growth in the quarter after you back out the expected seasonal paydowns. And on top of that, as always, we have qualitative factors. So it's really being driven by the credit outlook, but also by those other factors.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. But just to follow-up on that, the growth and ex-those seasonal factors would likely have been smaller than in prior periods, right? And so maybe you could just also \u2013 Rich had talked about the tail of that credit really dissipating as you get towards the end of this year and into next year. How long would it be that you would need to maintain the reserve at that level? At what point could it be used to essentially offset some of those charge-offs?","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah. So, one, the allowance is definitely covering the losses that we anticipate for the next 12 months. So that's the starting point of that. I think about where the allowance is going from here is a lot of, as Rich talked about, growth math. What you should anticipate with the allowance is the upward impact on charge-off rates from growth math starts to moderate.","I would expect that the allowance builds are going to start to be driven really by credit, our outlook on credit, on the economy and growth. And so you'll start to see them moving a little bit more just in terms of those drivers as opposed to the growth math drivers. But, Moshe, beyond those kinds of things, I don't think I'm going to get ahead to say that there's any part of the allowance that we're saving for later in the year or anything like that. It's all based on our outlook for the next 12 months.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citi.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, so Rich, in terms of a subprime card outlook, in terms of moderating the growth, I guess can you talk a little bit, is that being driven by more competition from other banks or are you just getting a little more concerned around where credit's trended versus your model? Can you elaborate a bit more on the subprime side on cards?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah, Don. So you probably heard us for, I would guess, four \u2013 this is like the fifth quarter now that we have been talking pretty vocally about supply out there in the marketplace. And the last few quarters we have pointed out the pretty striking growth rate of subprime itself. I don't have the number right in front of me, but I believe it's 14% year-over-year subprime growth for an industry that's growing at half that overall. Now, again, Don, that's off of \u2013 and I really want to stress this \u2013 it's off a much lower base that retracted significantly after the Great Recession. But still, that certainly has our attention, that subprime growth.","And so the primary thing about the competition is not so much that it slows our growth down because fewer people respond, although I think there is that effect. Much more our focus on the competitive aspects in these lending marketplaces is what it does to selection quality and what it does ultimately to the nature of credit.","And so the gradual decline in our growth rate, this is really now speaking of the whole card business, and I think as you can also see with our subprime percentage, that generally it has stayed flat or slightly actually grown over this period of time. But my point is a more universal point beyond subprime. The slowing of growth of Capital One has been probably minority parts affected by competition directly and majority parts just our own dialing back around the edges of our underwriting.","And when I use this term, dial around the edges, what I really mean by that, we have hundreds of programs that we launch every year. And as we watch these effects in the marketplace and study all of our little test sales and everything else, we don't so much go in and out of programs and just stop doing things. What we do is we just tighten up a little bit and we take the marginal cuts around the edges and we just dial it back a little bit.","And so pretty much if you go back to the peak growth of Capital One on the outstanding side was probably what we announced about one year ago. And from that point, which was really way at the kind of industry leading growth, we have just gradually dialed back a little bit off of that thing, plus a little bit more competition, leading us to where we are. The other thing I want to say is there's no dramatic thing right now that there's a change in the slope of our trajectory with respect to this.","This is more of a continuation of the same thing that we've been doing for an extended period of time. And the reason I made my comments about growth is I put together accelerating industry growth and sort of continuation for us dialing around the edges still in the context of aggressive marketing, especially at the top of the marketplace. All that I think adds up to some moderation of growth, but that's more of a continuation of the trends that we've seen as opposed to any new point that I'm making today.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","And that'll be from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please pick up your handset or release your mute. We're still not able to hear you.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Sorry. Good afternoon. I just had a question around the vintage performance for the Domestic Card book. I know you called out before that the 2016 vintages had been performing slightly better than 2015. In terms of the seasoning, is that still the case? And how large is the magnitude of the drop-off from some of the vintages that are moving past peak? Does it tend to be flatter or more steep for subprime?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Okay. So, first of all, left me talk about 2016 and relative to 2015. So as we just talked about over the last year and a half, we have been really starting at the beginning of 2016 and increasing as we move through 2016, we were tightening our underwriting around the edges. As a result of these actions, we expected that credit losses on the 2016 vintage would come in lower than losses on the 2015 vintage. And the first indications were consistent with that.","Given some of the trends in the industry and our latest data points and performance, we now believe that 2016 originations will come in on par with 2015 vintage losses. And I think there's an interesting thing I want to pull back on, a phenomenon I've seen a lot over the years, which is as you move into the parts of the cycle where growth is accelerating, you see effects that aren't exactly the same as you see in the rearview mirror.","Now, we try to anticipate that and get in front of that. And as you can see, ironically \u2013 and it's not ironic. I mean, it's a fine outcome. But what we thought was getting around it to such an extent, 2016 was going to be lower than 2015. And, in fact, the very, very early reads on the vintages would be consistent with that. It turns out that the sort of offsetting effects ended up that we're on par between the two.","But that's just to us so typical of how markets work. And our dialogue with you over time is trying to continually give you our view of the marketplace in which we operate. We then make our choices in anticipation of that and then calibrate as the results come in. So we feel great about all of our growth programs, 2014, 2015 and 2016.","And even on this day when we're actually doing an upward recalibration of the loss guidance, I again want to say these three years of outsized growth are going to really pay handsomely in terms of the earnings power of the company over time. There was a \u2013 you asked and I realized there was an earlier question I didn't answer on how are the vintages from the beginning of this growth spurt doing. So let me just talk a little bit about our 2014 vintage because those are first originations in our accelerated growth period. And we can already see evidence of delinquencies and losses peaking and starting to moderate.","So, again, this is the dynamic we've seen over and over for 20 years. What this call is about is calibrating when you have, in this case, three years of growth vintages piled on top of each other, to see how the actual timing and shape of the curves plays out for hundreds of programs. There are recalibrations along the way. And this is one of those recalibrations and it's a recalibration upward. But it takes nothing away from the dynamic of how all of these growth programs work, the incredible earnings power that they carry.","And I think also we're going to look back and be really, really appreciative that we \u2013 and this was a conscious choice, of course \u2013 but really accelerated our growth in the period when the industry was not growing. And, in fact, it's an interesting thing that we're a little bit decelerating into the industry's acceleration at this point. And the performance of the 2014 vintage is typical of the way these vintages will turn and really be the basis for the earnings power in the future.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll move to Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Instinet","Thank you. Good evening. I appreciate you taking my question. If I'm understanding your guidance correctly, the charge-off rate and the allowance as a percentage of loans that we now see are both at about 5.1% in Domestic Card should not keep rising and basically can hold at or below these levels. Is that a correct interpretation?","And then separately, is it reasonable to assume that both of those metrics, the charge-off rate and the reserve rate, can both remain at or below these levels that we saw this quarter if the labor markets remain healthy, as we look out at the rest of this year and into next?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Well, Scott, do you want to answer some of that? You go ahead and start, and I'll...","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah. Let me talk a little bit about the allowance and then, Rich, you can talk about where rates are going.","So in terms of the allowance, remember that the allowance is always based on our ending outstandings and balances that exist as of the end of the quarter. So some of the charge-off guidance that we've given also incorporates \u2013 the guidance by definition incorporates the charge-offs that we may incur on growth throughout the year. So there's a little bit of that that's baked in to there.","But pulling up on the allowance, just to reiterate a few things. So, one, implicit in our EPS guidance is our view that the Q1 allowance build is going to be the peak quarterly build for 2017. I mentioned that for Domestic Card, as we've talked about the upward pressure from growth math is starting to moderate as with work through 2017. And so with that type of pressure gone, we should see the allowance then starting to just be moved by more macro types of things as well as growth.","So changes in those factors, all of them can certainly cause things to move around. But at this point, based on the guidance and what we see today, we think that that was the peak for allowance builds in 2017.","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","And, Bill, just to comment about your question about where losses go from here. We've been very focused on trying to share with investors the impact of growth on credit metrics. There's always the economy and other things that can affect things and we don't really \u2013 we're not really trying to be in that prediction business.","But we're in the growth math story, we're actually at an important moment here because this is the peak of the growth mass effects. Now, that's not the same thing to say this is the peak of losses in a sense that, I mean, we've got seasonality and a lot of things going on that help here, too. But growth math is by definition the upward pressure on losses that come from an outsized burst of growth.","So we're talking about upward pressure. But here's the key thing, this is the peak of those growth math effects. As I saw in one of the analyst articles, Speaking Nerdily, if you talk about the second derivative, we are now the rate of growth is going down from here. And, in fact, the growth math effect will moderate over the course of this year and just has a small tail in 2018.","And what you're left with, of course, is, with respect to credit, is just all the other factors that drive credit, the industry factors, the economy factors and everything else. But the growth math story from this big burst of growth will have mostly played out over the course of this year.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Instinet","That's extremely helpful, Rich. Thank you. If I may squeeze in my follow-up. I wanted, Rich, to follow up around your earlier comments around lower recovery rates impacting severity in subprime auto. But I was hoping to ask you if you could please focus your thoughts a little bit more on the frequency side.","There has been obviously a lot of concern in subprime auto in recent months that's trickled into subprime card. And I just was hoping that you could discuss whether in your view delinquency rates in subprime auto and subprime card are highly correlated in this market, or are there differences between subprime delinquency trends in card versus auto? I would love to hear your thoughts on that.","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah, well, the first thing I want to say is that card delinquencies are a lot more telling than auto delinquencies. And so that's point number one. So whenever you \u2013 I always just take as one part of a lot of pieces of information when you're looking at auto what's happening to delinquencies because the way that people pay, and, frankly, really what happens is they wait. A lot of people wait until the moment before a car would be repossessed. And then the key thing is the payment rate at that point. And that's a lot more telling than the delinquency patterns that precede that. So that's just more of a general observation.","Whereas in the card business, delinquencies tend to just march on their way to charge-offs in fairly predictable ways. There has been a lot written about and talked about the auto business. And we have been one of the vocal commentators about the auto business for a long period of time. And I want to say you may notice, Bill, that we actually grew. We grew in our originations in the quarter.","This was a pretty solid year of growth for Capital One. And so our actions in each of these businesses I think are reflective of our view of these. We've looked with quite a bit of concern on the card side about the growth of supply. And that's been the key driver for us to dial back there.","In the auto business, the underlying consumer is the same. The economy effects and various things are the same. There's one anomalous difference that's going in the opposite direction of the card business, and it is the thing that has led us to be growing despite being so vocal about concerns about this marketplace. And that is what's happening on the supply side. There are at least a couple of big players in the marketplace that are pretty significantly dialing back and have done so gradually over the course of the last year. And as I've always said, for however important you think supply matters on the card side, it matters even more on the auto side because there's an auction marketplace there. And the supply and the pricing when you have auctions going on one dealer at a time really pressures the performance of growth and ultimately can have ripple effects on credit.","So here we are with all of our concern about used car prices, our concern about consumer indebtedness that is growing and we're trying to also incorporate the supply side that is moving in the opposite direction that's led us to have a surge of growth here. We're actually now stepping in more to probably take that in terms of price and margin, less so in volumes just because we continue to share the macro concerns about progressively moving along in the cycle relative to consumer indebtedness.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll move to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. Good evening. I'm sorry to keep asking this question, but just on the charge-off rate as we look out to the next year, Rich, taking all your comments together, as we look out to next year and to first quarter, in the absence of some kind of macro weakness or macro impact, it would appear, given that you have a small tail related to growth math, that you wouldn't see significant pressure year-over-year in the charge-off rate. Obviously, there's seasonality through the year this year. But as we look out to next year, it would seem like there shouldn't be much of an upward bias to the rate. Is that correct?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Well, Sanjay, I'm going to stick with the comments that we have made on that topic. But with respect to growth math, the story is really just has a small tail next year. And it's really mostly going to be a story about where the card industry is and the economy are at that time. And we won't probably be talking that much about growth math anymore.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess when we look at this range of EPS growth that you guys have called out for this year, is the delta just what the provision might be, or are there other factors that we should consider?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","I think that the range represents \u2013 I mean this is not like a massively scientific exercise. Obviously, there are judgment calls. This represents the range that we believe that we can do, even despite the credit pressures on earnings this year. And I think it's a reflection of the underlying earnings power of the business, the continuing momentum of efficiency. But that's the range that we chose there. It's not massively scientific.","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","I'd just add in, I think that the range certainly takes into account the charge-off guidance range that we gave you, but also the fact that other parts of the income statement can move up and down and that we're not expecting to, as long as we're inside that charge-off range, that that's a direct path through either way and that there's going to be puts or takes to land inside that EPS range.","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Pardon, I just want to say one other thing about that one. We don't usually, I mean usually, but we rarely \u2013 I have to think back when's the last time we gave EPS guidance at Capital One? It was a long time ago. So a little bit probably all of you should be wondering what on earth are we doing stepping out and doing something like this.","But the reason for doing it is that we really did want to show the underlying earnings power of the business, the momentum we have on the efficiency side and, in a sense, demonstrate that even with the front-loaded pressure that happens whenever you have a credit event because then you bring all the allowance effects for it and it gets to be pretty intense, that there is still earnings power at a time like this that the business can generate. And I think that that's really the point that we're making here.","We're also making the point that this doesn't have like an infinite capacity to absorb surprises from here. And we want to be clear about that. But we're certainly all-in driving to generate that EPS growth.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll take that from Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you and good afternoon. Rich, the RoE has come down over the last couple of years, and I guess driven in part by the growth math. But your capital ratios have come down to where you've targeted. So we shouldn't see returning of capital beyond earnings. What is the right RoE for Capital One, the return on tangible equity? Where would you like it to be? What kind of a range is proper as the business mix has shifted?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Well, Bob, one thing that's very clear right now, there are a couple of things that are pressuring RoE. At the top of the list is growth. And with growth comes a double whammy on the credit side. One because of originations have front-loaded loss curves. So you have that effect. And then of course on the allowance side, you're bringing forward everything even more so.","And the other thing is the significant investment that Capital One has been doing in transforming our company in response to the biggest revolution in the history of mankind and something that's going to absolutely transform banking and is only in the very early stages of doing that. So those two effects collectively have pulled down the earnings power of Capital One relative to what you might say is the more inherent earnings power.","So where do we go from here? I'm not going to give a specific guidance on that number, but both of these things we're investing in are going to be good guys in terms of the returns of the company. The tremendous growth over the last few years in the card business as we pass through the seasoning of the vintages turns into a significant good guy on the earnings side, and that's a pretty sustainable kind of earnings stream there.","And there's a striking thing that's been happening on the tech side, and that is that while we continue to invest heavily in technology and we will continue to do so, we also keep a meter of what are the savings that are directly attributable to this. And this meter is growing and it's growing pretty darn significantly. So it's very clear where that's headed over time and that's going to become more of a good guy over time.","So the very thing that's holding down earnings in the recent time period and sort of like now is the very thing that over time is going to be the things that I think will propel both the returns to be higher and, frankly, put Capital One in a position to be at the higher end of the League Tables in terms of growth.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. And my follow-up question is just on rewards. Are you seeing any signs? Do you think that rewards competition has peaked as credit losses start to move up a little bit, does that put some pressure on the ability to offer rewards for the industry? So do you expect to see \u2013 have you seen competition stabilize and do you expect it to pull back at all on the rewards side?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","I would not invest on any thesis that rewards competition's going to get to be less. I'm going to predict it will increase. Now, the rate of increase may lessen. There's been a lot of competition in the last year, but I don't see any evidence that rewards competition is declining. I think what you might see is maybe it's going to settle out more. I think that's the optimistic case that it settles out. Frankly, I really think if you go back and talk about how do you win, I'll give you my own view, how do we win in the heavy spender marketplace.","So much of the conversation and what's on TV and everything is about product. And product, of course, it's an important thing and it's a thing that there's a lot of arms race going on about. But winning is about product. It's about marketing. It's about customer experience. It's about brand. And it's hard to snap your fingers and get in a great place with respect to those.","But a comment about each. I think maybe over time the product competition might settle out a little bit because that's where it has been most intense. Marketing, we spent more than two decades building this company around in a sense the science of marketing as well as the art of marketing. But what you see in terms of TV marketing and so on, behind-the-scenes, the even in many ways more important thing is the whole world of digital marketing, the power of information-based strategies to do that. That's a very important part of this.","The customer experience, that's classically thought of in terms of things like the call center servicing experience. And companies like Capital One have invested heavily in that and have really, really I think now high performance with respect to that. But there's a whole new world coming on the customer experience side. And that's, of course, the digital customer experience where we're going all in on that and that's going to be a real competitive battleground of differentiation.","And finally, in the end, the hardest one to buy, but maybe the important one is brand itself. And I think the companies that have really gone all in on quality and sustain their investment in this part of the market for a long time are going to be rewarded by that. That's certainly what we're doing. So if I pull way up on that, certainly, we're all watching the competition around product. I think this'll be a competitive marketplace. In the end, I think competitors are going to fully internalize to win, you've got to win across all those dimensions. And the best ones will.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll take Matt Burnell with Well Fargo Securities.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Rich, you've mentioned several times tonight your focus on efficiency and improving the efficiency down to 51% this year, around that area, from 52% previously. Can you give us a little more color as to what initiatives or what areas would be most likely to benefit from that focus, relative to...","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yes.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","...rather than what it might have been three to six months ago?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Well, yeah, Matt. First of all, I want to clarify the guidance is in the 51%s. The prior guidance was in the 52%s. So I just want to be clear about that. So first of all, we've been very, very focused on this. And it is clear to us, in many ways back to the earlier question that was asked about the return profile of the business, it's very, very clear that a central way that our investors get paid is through operating efficiency. And so we have been very, very focused on that.","Where have we been generating that? First of all, just plain old-fashioned operating leverage. If you look at the numbers in the card business, you can see that. On the technology side, the relentless pursuit of efficiency. Even though I've said many, many times the technology investments are not motivated first and foremost in order to save money, frankly, it's for a lot of the other benefits that of a great customer experience, the ability to transform how the business works and so on. But along the way, the cost side is going to be an important beneficiary as we drive out analog costs and bring down the costs of our technology infrastructure and things like computing, storage, software development.","Also benefiting the efficiency side I think has been opportunities we've seen, frankly, on the old-fashioned again, on the pricing and margin side. We've had some opportunities across our business on that side as well. All of these things have been moving in the same direction and with a lot of driving from us. But all of it is manifesting itself in the ability to lower by a whole notch the efficiency ratio for the very year that we are now entering.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. That's helpful. And Rich, or actually maybe Scott, let me go on that idea of the pricing and margin side. You actually grew average interest-bearing deposits this quarter by about $6.5 billion. Didn't see much of an increase in the cost of those deposits. Can you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about deposit beta going forward? If there's anything unusual in that growth in the interest-bearing deposit base?","Stephen S. Crawford - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah, Matt. It's Steve Crawford. There's nothing unusual. The growth, there was a little bit of a mix difference in the growth which drove the increase in deposit costs in the quarter, but really performance as expected.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go to Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back over one other issue related to operating expenses and that's on the marketing side. Rich, you talked about the window getting smaller here. Does that mean you're likely to have to spend more on marketing to get the customers you like? Or because the window is going to be tougher, you might just give up on some of the opportunities? I'm just trying to think if we should think about marketing maybe having some upward pressure on it or not in coming quarters.","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah. Well, so the first thing \u2013 I'm glad you asked the question. The first thing that I have found over time, and I think we're seeing it now, as the competitive cycle moves along and we start trimming around the edges as we've been doing for a while, that thing doesn't directly translate into marketing because we still are doing the same programs and we still want our customers to sign up for those and we still very much want to make sure we get positive selection relative to that.","And so what tends to happen as you move through the more competitive part of the cycle is that marketing, you just get a little bit less for a similar investment in a lot of ways. So that's point one. But that's a very important distinction. It's not like we're getting good return on it. We are very, very pleased with the return and we measure that. We have metrics all over the place about the different denominators, the return on this marketing. And I think we feel very, very good about it and it's very comfortably above a threshold.","The second point I want to make is, a bunch of the marketing cost is for going right at the top of the marketplace. That's the rewards part of the business. That is a business that it's competitive in the classic business sense of competitive, but it doesn't have that second overlay of the credit impacts of so much supply. So there we just we continue to actually see a lot of success in what we would call the spender and heavy spender part of the marketplace. We're happy with our investment and our returns there, and we're continuing to market there.","So the only thing that's really getting trimmed around the edges is the underwriting cuts for our various credit programs. That's going to lead to a continuation of the slight deceleration you've seen over the last four quarters. Doesn't really have a lot of impact on marketing. But I would also say that we're not looking at this and saying, oh, my gosh, we've got to now massively ramp up the marketing to try to stay competitive.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Thanks very much.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll take John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Good afternoon. Rich, I heard what you said about 2016 vintages being on par with 2015, but a couple of your peer card players have actually indicated that 2016 is actually heading above 2015 levels. And I just want to get your thoughts on that. Is there risk that 2016 could actually be higher than 2015?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Well, the first thing I want to say is whenever we are on any statement that I would make about our portfolio, the more recent stuff is always more subject to uncertainty and, therefore, to change than things that are older, obviously, because the older it is, the more established the vintage curves are and it's really not going anywhere in that sense, right? Even this revision that we've been talking about here, in some ways 2016 had the most revision on a proportional basis, probably then 2015, a lot less so 2014 and so on. It's just that same principle.","The closer you are to having just been originated, the more information is still coming in that makes it subject to revision.","Now, I think the right way to look at 2016 vintages and their performance is what our competitors are saying, because not only have competitors said that, we have looked at credit bureau data. And if you construct vintage curves out of credit bureau data, you can find that exact effect that in 2016, the vintage curves in many ways starting around the second quarter industry-wide started gapping out relative to earlier ones. Okay?","Now, to us, this shows up in a different way, which is the thing I said that where we were headed to have 2016 better than 2015 because we had made anticipatory cuts with a tighter credit box. That effect that you're referring to, Jonathan (1:07:11), actually led to an offset of these two effects. So it's kind of a wash and our 2016 appears to be on par with 2015.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And then separately, just in terms of the growth math impact, I guess it's implying you still expect a degree of earnings leverage as this plays out. I mean, what type of magnitude of leverage do you expect? Is this something you would still call a coiled spring? And when now do you think that that could materialize? Thanks.","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","We've used the term coiled spring to describe the creation of earnings power from our card growth. And, well, basically as we're growing rapidly, the near-term returns of course are pressured by these high upfront costs. And with vintage curves with higher up-front losses and allowance build that brings it all forward. And then you put several years of growth in succession, and that further amplifies and extends this effect. So that's basically what we call the coiled spring and it remains in a very coiled position.","The precise timing of uncoiling depends in many ways on the actual shape and timing of the vintage curve from hundreds of programs. But the key thing that \u2013 the first thing to look for is as we now take one metaphor of coiled spring and turn to another term called growth math, the thing to look for is when the rate of increase in charge-offs starts to decline. And that is happening basically as we speak.","So what happens as the growth math effect plays out over the course of this year and there's a small tail of that next year, that puts us in a position to enjoy more of the benefits of the spring uncoiling. But to be fair, the uncoiling is not a moment in time. This is a phenomenon that happens as the vintage curves from a bunch of programs gradually settle out, the loss curves gradually decline and there's just a continual uncoiling that goes on as that happens.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll take Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Manam Ghusali (1:10:00) on for Betsy Graseck. Quick question. Can you speak to what impact the Cabela's portfolio would have on your NCO outlook?","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Could you repeat the question. Sorry, I couldn't hear the last part there.","Unknown Speaker","Could you speak to what impact the Cabela's portfolio acquisition would have on your NCO outlook?","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Sure. Well, let's just go through a few things. One, remember that all of our guidance excludes Cabela's. And so until we actually are able to have a really firm date as to when that thing is going to close, we're excluding it from our guidance. So just a reminder on Cabela's, that deal still requires regulatory approval, just not for us but for others. And so as soon as that regulatory approval happens, we'll be looking to close as quickly as possible. And at that point, we would anticipate providing more information about the impact of that deal on the company's outlook.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thanks. And separately, your tax rate was a lot lower this quarter. Was that related to the accounting change on RSUs?","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah, this is Scott again. And that's absolutely right. We did have a reduction of around $24 million of a benefit that went through the tax line item that was associated with the new accounting standard.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","We will take Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys, for taking my question. I want to reconcile a few things here. When we look at the NCO guidance for 2017, it's essentially been raised twice since you first laid out the framework for 2017 about 15 months ago.","The second thing that we're trying to understand is, and Moshe alluded to this, there was a pretty significant and atypical reserve build in the first quarter. And you saw the normal seasonal runoff, you saw the improvement in delinquencies. And Scott alluded to the fact that other factors drove reserve build.","When we parsed through all of this, I think the takeaway that you led everybody to is that the 2016 vintage is seasoning worse than you expected previously. That's great. Now we need to understand why that's happening. I mean, I think that's really the crux of what's going on here. And we know what; now let's try to delve into why.","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Rick, so first of all, this is not entirely just about 2016. Proportionally, just like I said earlier, the more recent the thing we're looking at, and in many ways, this is something I've seen before in the past because obviously we don't have a lot of data preceding that. But the more recent, the more there's been an adjustment. So proportionally, the 2016 vintage was adjusted the most, but there was an adjustment in 2015 and even an adjustment in 2014 as we're watching the various vintage curves play out. So I just wanted to make that clarification. It's not entirely a 2016 story.","So I don't think we're in a position to put a precise finger on this effect that was commented on earlier that a few other players have talked about something in 2016. We see in credit bureau data there's definitely some gapping out a little bit in terms of vintage curves. But we go back to watching the marketplace evolve. The trends that we saw six quarters ago start to accelerate in terms of the supply side of the business. And we have been pretty vocal about that there are a natural set of things that happen when the industry supply increases. One can't predict exactly when they are or what magnitude, but they tend to happen. So we're not really in a sense surprised by any of these effects.","In terms of precision on what's going on, I don't think we've got a great explanation. But I think that this is in many ways what happens as markets get more supply. And we've got to also remember, we're coming off the bottom of the most seasoned and we probably won't see this again for hopefully not for a long, long time in terms of what happened with the Great Recession, but the seasoning of everybody's portfolio and the survivorship of everybody's portfolio and what has happened now as the industry off of that base starts growing and then, frankly, accelerates into a higher level of growth. For us, it's all part of a natural process of our actually decelerating into their acceleration.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Rich. And, look, we start with the premise that you guys are really good at credit. That's been our thesis on the stock. And I guess what I'm hearing is that ex-post factors in terms of competitive behavior have had a material impact on credit performance, on vintages that you thought you had a pretty tight understanding on.","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Well, I think competition for more than 20 years, Rick, I have seen the competitive environment affect credit performance. And so I'm not sure that there's any new point that I'm making here. And nor are we saying, gosh, there's some big industry effect. I want to go back to what we said before. We made a conscious choice to grow way above market rates, not only in 2014, but again in 2015 and well into 2016. That's a lot of growth on top of each other.","Growth programs have an inherent uncertainty about how the actual vintages precisely play out on their shape and their timing, not their ultimate outcome and the returns which we feel fabulous about. In many ways, what we're talking about here is a refinement with the benefit of more data that has led to an overall modest upward revision in terms of the overall loss rate that we expect in 2017. And that's just a reflection of how the management of the business works.","And this time, unfortunately, it's an upward adjustment and that hurts in terms of the allowance build associated with that. But the underlying story is really the same. The earnings power of the growth, the opportunity we see in the card business including in the subprime part of the marketplace, the coiled spring, the earnings power, and, in fact, even at a time like this, we still like our chances to get pretty good EPS growth in the 7% to 11% range","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Rick, I've got to come back just real quick on your allowance question and make sure that we have this really clear, because the allowance build in the quarter was principally driven by the change in charge-off guidance. That is vastly the build. We always add qualitative factors on top of that. And when you've got an environment where there's a lot of competitive activity going on, those are factors that typically get captured in your qualitative factors. So like every period, we added those on top, but growth is a factor there, too. So I wanted to make sure that it was clear that the primary factor was the change in charge-off guidance.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","And our final question comes from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good evening, gentlemen. And I appreciate the time for the question. Look, I really appreciate all the commentary you're trying to provide around credit. I have really two questions that I'm hoping you might be able to give us a very blunt or factual answer around. In terms of losses, there's this concept of cumulative losses. I know you're familiar with it. Is there a way to frame 2014 or 2015 vintages in terms of cumulative losses in subprime credit cards?","I mean, everybody's looking at growth curves and they may understand that they peak a couple of years after the vintage. But it'd be really helpful if we knew what the end state of those losses would be within what Capital One's doing on subprime credit cards. If not for Capital One specifically, what would your assessment be of the industry cumulative losses?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah, Ken. The very concept that has a lot of power in auto because it's a term loan doesn't really work so well on the card side. And also depending on where people play in the subprime marketplace, the losses can vary by a multiple of each other. So we have spent two decades building in a sense the information base and database capability to identify in the subprime marketplace who are the diamonds in the rough, if you will, the people that look like maybe they're not so good credit, but turn out to be a lot better than that. And that's a couple of decades worth of investment, including making it through the Great Recession successfully.","But the cum loss concept isn't really probably the operative thing. What I will say is, most importantly, we measure this in terms of the net present value of our programs. And to go back to something I said earlier, we go and we measure before, during and after every program what is the net present value of that program. And we have hundreds and hundreds of programs. We add those all up by year and then look at what the entire value created for that year is. We have done that and we continue to revise that all of the time.","Our current view is, even including the latest data on credit, is that 2014, 2015 and 2016 vintages, the total net present value of these is really at the very high end from all \u2013 you'd have to go all the way back to the early 2000s to find something exceeding these levels. And so, to us, it's about the value creation.","And the other critical variable is the resilience. How do these perform under stress? And I think what we like about this collectively, all the things we're originating, is I think there's a lot of earnings power there. The resilience I think has been well demonstrated. And I think the growth programs that we're talking about today are the foundation of a lot of earnings power for Capital One for years to come.","Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just finally, you pointed out that other credit card companies are growing. That obviously gets you in a little bit of a situation where they're potentially increasing leverage on the same customers that you've in essence capped out yourself. How do you protect yourself in that environment where there could be increasing indebtedness in the U.S. card book so that you could mitigate some of that risk?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Ken, it's a great question and it's a question we obsess about every single day because, in this business, customers, they don't just say, I've got one credit card and that's all they do. We can do all of our underwriting and have it just seem perfect and then the customer can take on a lot of debt, big high lines and other things, even in cards or beyond cards, and then that can spoil what we had planned.","There're no guarantees in this business. What we do is try to watch a few decade's worth of experience in doing this and try to build in, most importantly, the resilience for things that might happen. How do we build resilience? Be very, very careful on credit line. How do we build resilience? Build it into the margin of the business, build it into the way that we manage the accounts over time and do this in the context of being absolute students of what is now more than two decade's worth of experience in the good times and the bad, the good decisions, the mistakes, the whole thing, the Great Recession.","And while there are no guarantees, that is basically what we do. But your question I think goes to the heart of why in the end this isn't an actuarial science. This is a dynamic risk management business.","Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you for your time and all your conversation this evening. Appreciate it.","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Bye, Ken.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Well, thank you, Ken.

Rich and Scott will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements.

And for more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our Annual and Quarterly Reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Blackley. Scott?","Scott Blackley","Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned 1.4 billion or $2.86 per share in the first quarter. Net of adjusting items earnings per share were $2.90. The only adjusting items we had in the quarter was 25 million of launch in integration costs associated with our Walmart partnership.","Slide 13 outlines the financial impacts of this adjusting item. Pre-provision GAAP earnings increased 18% on a linked quarter basis and 2% year-over-year to 3.4 billion. Revenue of 7.1 billion was 1% higher than Q4 '18 and 3% higher than a year ago. Relative to the prior quarter non-interest expense was down 11%, largely from a lack of Q4 seasonal spending. Compared to the prior year, non-interest expense was higher by 3% driven by increased marketing spend as operating expenses remained flat.","Provision for credit losses increased 3% on a linked quarter basis driven by an allowance build in the quarter. Charge-offs were relatively flat as there were a modestly offsetting seasonal changes in our auto and domestic card businesses. On a year-over-year, basis provision cost were higher by 1%, driven by a larger allowance build in the quarter, partially offset by lower charge-offs in our domestic card business.","Let me take a moment to explain the quarterly movements in allowance across our businesses, which are detailed in Table 8 of our earnings supplement. Reserves in our commercial business increased by 55 million, driven by the establishment of reserves related to a few specific credits and loan growth. Our credit cards business saw an allowance increase of 25 million, driven by a build in international card, partially offset by a small release in domestic card. In our consumer business, there was a build of 14 million driven by growth and portfolio mix in our auto business.","Turning to Slide 4, net interest margin was 6.86%, down 7 basis points year-over-year. The strong growth in Capital Ones 360 deposit products drove an increase in our average deposit costs, which was the key driver of the year-over-year decrease in our net interest margin. We continue to expect deposit cost to be a headwind to NIM throughout 2019.","I also want to provide a reminder about Q2 NIM seasonality. Recall, the net interest margin declined by 27 basis points from Q1 to Q2 last year and around half of that decline was attributable to normal seasonal factors.","Turning to Slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis is 11.9%. We continue to view our capital need to be around 11% CET1. We are keeping a close eye on how CECL will impact CCAR stress testing, which could impact our view of our future capital need.","We continue to believe that we have sufficient capital and earnings power to support growth. The Walmart portfolio acquisition later this year the phased in an impact of adopting CECL on January 1, 2020 as well as a 2019 CCAR capital distribution request is meaningfully higher than 2018, of course, which is subject to regulatory approval.","Before, I turn the call of Rich, let me take a moment to update you on our Walmart partnership. We now expect the acquired portfolio will be in the low $8 billion range at closing. Adjusting for this portfolio size, we now expect the day one allowance build to be around 100 million. Of course, the actual balances acquired and the day one allowance build will depend on the program performance between now and close.","We continue to expect that in 2019, we will incur 225 million in one-time expenses to watch the new originations program and integrate the acquired portfolio, and that the overall Walmart partnership inclusive of those costs will have return to resilience in line with our domestic credit card business.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich.","Richard Fairbank","Thank you, Scott, and good evening. Slide 8 summarizes first quarter results for our credit card business. First quarter pretax income was up 7% from the prior year, as the positive impact of revenue growth and lower provision for credit losses were partially offset by higher non-interest expense. Credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic card business, which is shown on Slide 9.","In the first quarter, domestic card ending loan balances were up $2.5 billion or about 3% compared to the first quarter of last year. Average loans grew about 2%. Revenue increased 4% from the first quarter of 2018, driven by purchase volume growth and loan growth. Revenue margin increased 21 basis points to 16.15% for the quarter. Non-interest expense was up about 6% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating expenses increased as we began to ramp up operational capabilities for a smooth Walmart conversion and launch later this year.","The larger driver of the increased non-interest expense was higher marketing. For years, we have worked tirelessly to build a franchise at the highest end of the marketplace, heavy spenders. Heavy spenders are hard to get, but exceptionally valuable to have. They are long-term annuities that pay off on the bottom line with strong interchange revenue, loan balances from occasional revolving, very low charge-offs and very low attrition.","They can't be bought with just marketing. They have to be earned with great products and exceptional customer experience, leading digital capabilities and a trusted brand. Great marketing then tells the story. We are seeing accelerating traction growing our heavy spender franchise. Account originations have grown to record levels over the last two quarters. Led by heavy spenders, domestic card purchase volume growth was 8.3% from the prior year quarter or 10.3%, if normalized for two fewer processing days in the first quarter of 2019.","Net interchange growth was 18% aided by a favorable rewards liability adjustment. Excluding that, net interchange growth was in line with purchase volume growth. Notably, we've been able to grow our spender franchise without sacrificing revenue margin. Our growth has not just been with heavy spenders. In the first quarter, overall branded card account originations grew 16% year-over-year. Branded cards exclude all private label and cobranded cards.","Loan growth is also picking up, even as we continue to be cautious on credit line. Domestic card loan growth was 2.6% year-over-year, including 4% growth in branded card loans offset by some shrinkage in partnerships. Strong credit performance continued to be a driver of domestic card results in the first quarter. The charge off rate for the quarter was down -- excuse me, was 5.04%, down 22 basis points from the first quarter of 2018.","Growth math continues to be a good guy. Credit performance on the loans booked during our growth surge in 2014, 2015 and 2016 continued to improve year-over-year and drove the year-over-year improvement in the overall domestic card charge-off. Pulling out in the first quarter, competition in the credit card marketplace was relatively stable and rational and our domestic card business delivered strong results and gain momentum.","Slide 10 summarizes first quarter results for our consumer banking business. Both ending loans and average loans decreased about 21% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the home loans portfolio sale in 2018. Ending loans in our auto business were up 3% year-over-year. Auto originations declined and loan growth decelerated as competitive intensity in auto increased in the quarter.","Ending deposits in the consumer bank were up 6% versus the prior year quarter with a 38 basis point increase in average deposit interest rate. We're making digital banking easy with our award-winning mobile banking experience, powered by the rollout of our national banking strategy, our strongest deposit growth is in Capital One 360 products, driving a product mix shift towards higher rates deposit products.","Over the past year, the change in product mix, rising interest rates and increasing competition have put upward pressure on deposit rates. Looking ahead, we expect further increases in average deposit interest rate, as faster growth in higher rate deposits continues to change our product mix. Consumer banking revenue increased about 3% from the first quarter of last year. Growth in auto loans and retail deposits was partially offset by the revenue reduction from the home loans portfolio sale.","Non-interest expense was essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter. Provision for credit losses was also essentially flat from the first quarter of 2018. The auto charge-off rate improved modestly compared to the prior year quarter, and we had a modest allowance build in the first quarter. Better than expected auction values continue to support strong auto credit. Over the longer-term, we continue to expect that the auto charge-off rate will increase gradually as the cycle plays out.","Moving to Slide 11, I'll discuss our commercial banking business. First quarter ending loan balances were up 8% year-over-year. Growth in average loans was 10%. Linked quarter growth was more modest with ending loans up about 1% and average loans up about 3%. Commercial bank ending deposits were down 9% from the prior year.","Over the past year, commercial deposits customers have rotated out of deposits and into higher yielding investments in the rising interest rate environment. First quarter revenue was down 2% from the prior year quarter, driven by lower average deposit balances. The revenue benefit of higher average loan balances was offset by lower loan margins.","Non-interest expense was up 3% compared to the prior year quarter, as we continue to invest in technology and other business initiatives. Provision for credit losses increased compared to the first quarter of 2018, when we actually posted a net benefit from credit performance because of an unusually large allowance release. This year, we posted an allowance build in the first quarter, driven by loan growth and the establishment of reserves related to a few specific credits.","The credit performance of our commercial banking business remains strong. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 0.08%. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 2.9% and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.5%. Pulling up, increasing competition from non-banks continues to drive less favorable terms in the commercial lending marketplace.","We're keeping a watchful eye on market conditions and staying disciplined in our underwriting and origination choices. In the first quarter, Capital One continued to post solid results as we invest to grow and to drive our digital transformation. Compared to the first quarter of 2018 revenue, non-interest expense, pre-provision earnings and earnings per share all increased. Provision for credit losses was essentially flat.","First quarter marketing expense declined from the unusually elevated level in the fourth quarter, but was up compared to the prior year quarter. Our marketing investments are building our momentum and creating great value.","In our domestic card business, marketing is strengthening our heavy spenders franchise and driving strong year-over-year growth in new accounts, purchase volume and net interchange revenue. In our consumer banking business, our national advertising, brand and compelling digital customer experience enabled us to post strong retail deposit growth without being the industry price leader.","Turning to 2019, marketing will as always depend on our continuous assessment of opportunities in the competitive marketplace. With the momentum we have, we expect full year marketing for 2019 to be modestly higher than in full year 2018, with more normal seasonal patterns than the exaggerated patterns we saw last year.","In closing tonight, I'd like to pull up and provide some context on our digital transformation and the impact we expected to have on key aspects of our longer term financial performance. When we try to envision the future of banking, we don't start with how banking works or what other banks are doing. We look at how technology is changing our lives. Just look at the technology and applications you use every day.","What is common to all of them is they provide you with instant solutions customized for you. What powers that? Tech companies that are built on a modern technology stack, leveraging the power of big data and machine learning in real time. Banking is headed to the same destination. Consumers will demand it. Technology competition will necessitate it. The challenge is banks aren't built to deliver those capabilities.","What we're doing at Capital One is building a technology company that does banking, instead of the bank that just uses technology. Our transformation stands on the shoulders of everything we have built in our 25-year journey at Capital One. While we didn't use the term back then we were in original fin-tech.","It is striking that our battle cry at the founding of our company was to build the tech company that does banking. The reason that we declared the same battle cry six years ago is that we realized that the world has changed so much that we needed to yet again build sweepingly new infrastructure and capabilities from the ground up.","We are now six years into this latest technology transformation. Our progress is accelerating. We've hired thousands of engineers and built the scale engineering organization. We have deeply embedded designers, data scientists and product managers into our business. We work in agile. We harness the power of highly flexible APIs and micro services to deliver and deploy software.","We have embraced the public cloud and are well on our way to migrating our applications and data to the cloud. We are now considered one of the most cloud forward companies in the world. Our technology transformation is motivated by many things beyond cost. Faster the market, better products, better customer experience, better risk management, more effective operations, more growth. We are already seeing significant benefits across the Company.","But an important beneficiary will be the economics of our business. Digital productivity gains are driving operating leverage. Since our journey began, operating efficiency ratio has improved by 400 basis points, even as we have continued to invest in our transformation. We are operating today with one foot in the legacy data center environment and one foot in the cloud as we work to complete our cloud journey.","As we migrate an increasing percentage of our applications and data to the cloud, we will have all those costs and at the same time until we fully exit our data centers. We also bear the significant legacy cost as well. We expect to complete the exit of our data centers by the end of 2020, which should generate significant cost and efficiency improvement opportunities beginning in 2021.","Until then, we will continue to drive for operating efficiency improvements even with the elevated cost of straddling both environments. We expect to achieve modest improvements in full-year operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments in both 2019 and 2020. Adjusting items in 2019 include one-time Walmart launch and integration expense.","We expect full year operating efficiency ratio. Net of adjustments to improve to 42% in 2021, powered by the exit of our data centers, continuing technology innovation and Walmart, and we expect this operating efficiency improvement to drive significant improvement in total efficiency ratio by 2021 as well.","The improvements in efficiency are but one of many benefits we will enjoy from our technology transformation. We are well positioned to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create long-term shareholder value.","Now, Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions.","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts that may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available after the call.","Leanne, let's start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.","Eric Wasserstrom","Rich, just to follow up on the marketing commentary, you, in last quarter you signaled that you are focusing on acquiring accounts but keeping lines low in anticipation of maybe some potential change in the credit environment, but would give you the flexibility to increase lines at a future date. Is that still the strategy? Or is there any change to that approach?","Richard Fairbank","Eric, we are being cautious online. Let me tell you about how that works. It means that we want to see more validation before extending more line. And in fact, with every passing month, we are seeing increasing validation in the performance of recent vintages, and this augurs well for more line extensions over time.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great, and maybe just to follow up on that. We've seen some information of data that points to some weakening in credit in kind of mid-FICO modestly better than median income cohorts. Are you seeing anything like that? Or just more broadly, are you seeing any particular subpopulations where there is evidence of deteriorating asset quality?","Richard Fairbank","Eric, a thing that we noticed and we've seen this, we're kind of on the lookout for it but we have now with the benefit of hindsight seen some degradation of performance of consumers for a given FICO growth. This isn't a Capital One thing in fact it isn't even an industry origination thing. This is really a, we can see that all the way just sort of looking at bureau data.","And the reason that we sort of hypothesized this is, well, let me say our hypothesis for this modest effect, but I think it is important to note is that given the how long derogatory data stays on the credit bureaus, the derogatory data from the great recession has over the last few years been rolling off.","And so, our hypothesis has been and one of the reasons for our own conservatism has been, we may be looking at data that are might do not paying for full picture of a consumers sort of credit history. So, we've been on the lookout for that. We have seen the effect certain by FICO score. Different people did have a different hypothesis for the effects.","Now, in terms of what we do we, we built comprehensive credit models that are far beyond sort of just a snapshot of bureau score. And so I think we feel very good about our credit the recent vintages the performance of fact, my comments earlier about validation with respect to our performance, making us more comfortable with some line increases values, indicative of that same point.","But they are part of the context for our caution has been not only sort of how deeply are in the FICO, but also this is a time period when they of less information than there once was on the bureau and we all need to be careful consumers of that information as we make our credit decisions.","Operator","And will take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Appreciate the color on the cloud migration and the cost reductions from closing the data centers. I guess two questions on that. One, Rich, can you just talk about what competitive advantage it gives you from moving to the cloud and sort of the functionality there? And then secondly, on the 42% in 2021, is it fair to assume that there could be an expansion that's more greater than normal in the future because you have got leverage off that maybe Scott could you address that?","Richard Fairbank","So, we've talked for years about the benefits of going to the cloud and I think there are many benefits, and ironically the costs are not really at the top of the list. Our, what we hypothesis and we are finding is that, things are faster. The scalability is much greater the kind of it takes to provision. A hardware and software environment is much faster. The ability to scale up and down basically on demand, the ability to tap in to the world's innovation that, that is going on in that segment and also benefit in security and reliability. And along the way there economic benefits as well.","So, it's a pretty compelling case. The bigger issue and the issue that all American corporations faced is not G on paper is, are there a lot of benefits from going to cloud? The big question is how on earth are we going to get there from here? And that requires confronting really for most companies, decades and decades of you know heritage in terms of who they are, the talent, the infrastructure, the way the Company works, culture and you know it is -- the big issue is the journey.","And therefore, the big news for Capital One is that we're announcing that, we have line of sight to the completion of that journey. That's not the completion of our entire tech transformation in the sense. We will probably always be in a tech transformation because the world is in one, but it's a very important milestone for Capital One to arrive at this destination, but it's really a story of journey. And that is you know, that's what American companies are really going to have to confront each of them in their own way as they decide what they want to be when they grow up from a technology point of view. With respect to 42% just explain your question again when you said will that expand.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Yes, I guess, is there more leverage ability off that 42% because you are moving to the cloud and you're not as physical data center intensive.","Richard Fairbank","No, I think the very full year run rate benefit of getting out of the straddle and being fully on the cloud are reflected in the 42 number. I think from there we have always said, basically, the more we transform comprehensively into a digital company, the more benefits that can accrue over time in terms of the economics of the business.","With respect to the, I think the number reflects the full benefit of getting out of the data centers and being in one environment and not two. I think the longer journey of Capital One is going to continue to be one where we drive, continue to drive our customers to digital and drive our company to digital and the many benefits that I cited one of which is economics you know should continue to manifest themselves.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","Scott, you'd mentioned that the targeted capital return would be meaningfully higher in 2019. Can you elaborate a little bit on that in terms of your priorities, buybacks, dividends, and if you can maybe sort of better quantify where that payout ratio target might go?","Scott Blackley","Yes, Don, thanks for the question. We're closing out Q1 at around 11.9% the easy one. So, we're in a position where we're above our 11% capital need and I would expect that we're' going to accrete more capital in Q2, because as you may recall, we've already completed our 2018 CCAR share repurchase program. So, you know, I would -- we're not going to be in a position of distributing more capital before we get fed approval on our 2019 plan.","I'm not going to comment on CCAR at this point. I just don\u2019t want to get ahead of the fed release, so I'm not going to give you any more details about that. I'll just say in general and I'm going to reiterate some of the points. I made in my talking points, but we are in a really good position. I believe to fund organic growth to fund the Walmart acquisition.","We got the first phase of CECL coming in 2020, which were going to need to support new capital. And then taking all those things and looking at the earnings power that we have and our capital position today, I feel pretty good that we're going to be able to have a distribution, a capital distribution that is quite higher than what we had last year in our CCAR plan.","Don Fandetti","Lastly, it looks like the delinquency rate on a year-over-year basis, domestic cards is sort of creeping up a little bit each month. Can you talk a little about your expectations going forward?","Scott Blackley","Yes, so, Don, our -- let me start with our credit losses. Our losses are still improving on a year-over-year basis, while as you point out our delinquencies were about 4% higher than the year-ago quarter. There are some idiosyncratic drivers of that increase. For example, we change loss recognition timing for the Cabela's portfolio to align with Capital One practices back in October of 2018.","This had only a slight effect to our overall credit metrics but it impacts the year-over-year delinquency comparison by a few percentage points, interestingly. First quarter may also have some effects from government shutdowns, including delays to some tax refund payments, which contribute to the seasonal movements in our credit metrics this time of year. So, I wouldn't read too much into delinquencies in this slightly noisy quarter.","Pulling up our unique growth math dynamics have been the dominant driver of our credit performance for some time. First, driving our credit losses up and then down and growth math continues to be a good guy. Of course, our credit is also impacted by the economy. The competitive cycle our growth choices and other industry effects.","So, we would expect a little normalization in terms of overall current industry performance overtime. So, going forward, we will have a couple of offsetting drivers of current credit, growth math that will continue to be a good guy and industry normalization that will likely fall in the other direction.","Operator","And will take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Rich, on the 42% efficiency target, I mean, clearly that has two sides to the equation in terms of expenses and revenues. So, can you maybe size for us how big the cost component of that is, just given the fact that the revenue environment could end up being different better or worse relative to what you're expecting and as of today? And then I guess, secondly, given that marketing historically somewhere between 600 and 800 basis points of efficiency. Is it safe to say that we'll be looking at an efficiency ratio below 50% over time?","Richard Fairbank","So, Ryan, we don't. What we try to do in doing this 42, I mean, we can always create point estimates. The one thing we know about point estimates in our business, and by the way our investors have all experienced this. Point estimates, that only think you know is they're not going to be exactly bad with respect to a particular metric like revenue. So what we did is go through a metric of outcomes of different revenue thinking through, you know what, how the costs associated with different revenue outcomes.","And you know, sort of the way we think of it is, if you if you take away the what I'm calling good guys that are coming in 2021, our story really is, and this was kind of in our guidance, our general guidance we've been giving over the last couple of years. That the combination of revenue growth and continuing to drive on the cost of digital productivity gain general side, that will drive gradual improvement in operating efficiency.","So, the other primary point we're making here is on top of what we think is a gradual improvement that will come from all the things that we do on the revenue and cost side. We're pointing out a few specific good guys that happen to align themselves around the full year 2021. And those good guys are of course the exit of our data centers by the end of 2020, which should drive significant savings beginning in 2021.","Some technology innovation that will enable some specific, some efficiency gains, and then the benefits from the Walmart partnership, now that also line lines up around 2021 because of the revenue sharing structure that we, in our deal with Walmart and as you recall, the revenue sharing is less over the first year of the deal. And then it steps up to the full revenue share thereafter, so there's kind of a coincidence of where several things sort of align themselves around 2021.","So, if I pull way up to your question, well, you know, we don't know -- we will see where the revenue and all the metrics you know that drives operating efficiency where they go over time. I just think a lot of planets align and a lot of things that are we sometimes use the word baking in the oven, things that are really in the works, where we are able to do something it's a little out of character for Capital One to give such a specific number several years out in the future. But that would be the context behind that, Ryan.","Jeff Norris","Next question.","Richard Fairbank","Oh, he asked the question on the marketing side. So, I'm not -- we're not giving a specific number with respect to total efficiency ratio and that is because marketing of course is very driven by the contact that we find ourselves in overtime and the opportunity to really generate great business when we get there. And that's not a thing that were going to guide ourselves to several years out in the future, but I think our other point was that the significant it's a bit the operating efficiency improvements to 42, we expect that this improvement will drive significant improvement in total efficiency ratio by 2021 as well.","Operator","And will take our next question from Chris Brendler with Buckingham.","Chris Brendler","So, I just had a question on card business, really nice acceleration with non-net interest income this quarter up to 13%, if anything you call out there. And then related, it looks like subprime mix on the card business ticked up at tiny bit, not make a big deal out of it. Just want to know if it's more macros or is there a decision on the underwriting side?","Scott Blackley","Yes, Chris, this is Scott. A couple of things there, so one on interchange, Rich, mentioned that we had an adjustment to our rewards liability. That was about $51 million and so just some context there. Every quarter, we update our estimates of the cost of honoring our card rewards. And that estimate always considers changes in consumer redemption patterns and then any updates that happen in terms of terms and conditions. So, we usually see some level adjustment here every quarter or sometimes it's an increase, sometimes it's a decrease. This quarter was $51 million, the least.","Chris Brendler","And then on the service fee side, there, is it coming down quite a bit still? Is that conscious decision?","Scott Blackley","On the service fees, a few things there, on a year-over-year basis, a couple things; one, there were a few small ticket one-time or benefits in Q1 '18. And then on an ongoing basis, we have exited a number of the subscale businesses that impact that line item as well. So you know, I think that most of that is in the Q1 2018 number, but not in the 2019 number. So, I would say that the 353 million of service charge and fee income for Q1 is a pretty clean quarter.","Richard Fairbank","Chris, with respect to subprime mix, our subprime asset mix of 34% is flat year-over-year and sort of in line with our historical portfolio mix of around one third, plus or minus. It is up lightly quarter over quarter in line with seasonal trends and all these numbers there's always rounding so these are integers. So, I think the takeaway that you really should have is there's not a lot of news with respect to the subprime mix.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rick Shane with JP Morgan.","Rick Shane","Rich, I think impulsively when you're talking about account growth. You're bifurcating between heavy spenders and traditional revolvers. Our assumption is that for the heavy spenders that you'd have to be pretty competitive in terms of line limit. Is that the right way to be thinking about it? And if that's the case when you look at the traditional revolvers do you think that most of the accounts that you have added do have the potential to grow the line limits over time.","Richard Fairbank","Yes. So, I'm glad you asked that question because there on many dimensions the heavy spender side of the business is so different from the revolver side of the business, but certainly one of them is credit line. So, let me start with heavy spenders. We, our lines are very competitive, very comparable to the leading players at the top of the market on the spender side. So, there's not a low line strategy with respect to heavy spenders.","On the revolver side, we have always been very conservative probably relative to industry practices with respect to our credit line and you know, looking for more validation over time. I think we raised the bar with respect to validation recently and that's why we've been talking more caution on credit lines.","Now let me talk now about the surge of growth that we've had along, that come complements to the surge of marketing that we have had. This is growth that is across the credit spectrum. It's actually, more up market shifted than usual, and that's kind of to my point earlier, we're especially getting traction at the top of the market.","And the way that you know all of those accounts will play out is very consistent with how spender business you know is booked. It's expensive to book, it's a great annuity, it grows over time, etc. The, still because of the you know the whole portfolio of what we're booking, there's lots of revolver business in there and it's all, pretty much all business that we are looking to build lines with. And as we are getting the validation, that's what we are doing.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Two questions just starting off, one the cloud. I've heard that the cloud can help deliver much more efficient marketing programs and drive much better efficiency in the marketing itself. So, I'm just wondering, if you are experience in that as well and is that something that we could either expect to drive better revenue for marketing dollar invested with use of this tool what potentially, even we talked a little bit earlier about driving down the budget, but that's a TBD kind of question. So I am just wondering, if you're seeing that same kind of marketing efficiency improvement that other are?","Richard Fairbank","So, when you say marketing efficiency improvements that others are, I think there are a lot of folks not leveraging the cloud at the moment and maybe they're enjoying marketing efficiency improvements too. I think there is a lot of things going on in the world of marketing and there is quite an impact that's coming from the major tech companies, who are driving a lot of the digital marketing channels and the choices they made to in the walled garden of their information, how much they either provide turnkey services for other banks or for other companies or provide data to facilitate companies on choice. But I think the whole world is getting more and more efficient with respect to digital marketing.","Here is one of that, but I mentioned earlier that it is kind of easy to write down on a piece of paper for what you've love to do with technology and the whole problem is how do you get there from here, and marketing is a classic example. We know the world is exploding in terms of data, big data and the ability to leverage more and more information to not only make better decisions, but to make them more customized on a micro really down to this segment of one. The elephant in the room is, how you mobilize massive big data in real-time, and I think for most American companies it's given enough time they can do a lot with data.","The challenge of when big data meets real-time that's where modern technology really separates itself from classical technology. So marketing is on the list of one of the many things that we -- are driving improvements and look forward to driving more improvements with overtime, but I don't want to set an expectation that you'll as we fully go in the cloud, you will suddenly see a huge improvement in our marketing efficiency because frankly with most of the marketing that we're doing -- we're basically in the cloud with respect to the marketing that were doing, so that's a journey that has been ongoing and we look forward to more progress.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, and then just separately on Walmart, where you talked about products that you'll be launching when that comes over on the consumer side. I'm wondering, is there anything are you working with or planning on doing with them on the business side in B2B or the supplier side of their business model? or is it going to be solely on consumer? Just help us understand if there's, how broad that relationship could be?","Richard Fairbank","Betsy, at this point our relationship with Walmart is consumer credit card.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Barker","And regards to some of the marketing spend that happened, ramped up quite a bit in the fourth quarter, would have expected a little bit better you know growth metrics here in the first quarter versus what we've seen last year. Could you just talk about what your expectation is for growth, and I believe some of your comments about some of the up market customers that you're starting to traction with, as we move through the next couple of quarters?","Richard Fairbank","So, Kevin, the one thing that I've said for probably those who have been following Capital One for many, many, many years, I've said all along, changes in marketing levels don't expect them to in coincident periods or even in immediately adjacent periods show dramatic effect on, especially on metrics like loans. So let me just talk a little bit about what's happening with respect to Capital One. So, the reason that we have -- we don't spend money in marketing just to spend it, one of the comments that I made in the earlier remarks is.","You can't buy your way to you know lots of growth just by spending money and especially at the top of the marketplace with spenders. This is all about earning it and for years we have been putting in place, we've been very committed to building a spender business and investing in the customer experience, the digital experience, the products and the brand to be in a position where along all of those dimensions we're seeing tremendous progress. And what sort of has happened in recent quarters is the alignment of a lot of progress on this with our spender business and traction with customers and our brand with non customers, combined with an actual opportunity that we see in the marketplace.","So, on the spender side of the business, you see a lot of our marketing is directed at the spender side of the business and we've had really tremendous traction there as I mentioned, and how that shows up is in significant growth of new accounts and those accounts are annuities that have great economics over time and the spenders ramp their purchases really literally for years. It doesn't move the loan growth needle a lot just by the basic numbers and how many heavy spenders there are and the fact that that -- it's a basically it's a numbers things. So the loan growth is dominated by what happens on the revolver side of the business.","And let me comment about that other than the capability, which always exists for any bank to do line increases and I would often called that a coiled spring and it's a great opportunity for companies to take advantage of it when they want if that's that the ultimate way to really drive growth is through new account origination. That's the prerequisite for loan and revenue growth on the revolver side. As these customers mature, we gradually increase credit lines which translate into loan and revenue growth, and we -- my point has been that we've had really strong account growth.","We are getting with every passing month more validation on the credit performance of advantages and all of this puts us in a position to capitalize on the to turn the account growth into loan growth and revenue growth overtime.","Operator","And will take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Rich, I was struck by the commentary about deposits cost growth and growth of online deposits and maybe if you could talk a little bit about the strategy there because getting more online deposits with higher cost including margins, isn\u2019t really in that itself a strategy. What's the plan there? How does that benefit the Company and shareholders?","Richard Fairbank","The first order for any company is or for any bank is, they need to fund the Company. And of course that, well, like there is a lot of different ways to fund the Company. Capital One is in that I love the position that Capital One is in where are our strongest and biggest funding sources on the consumer side, because that's where I think through recessions and if you look at how the fed rate various types of deposit.","If you look at the opportunity to have resilient funding and pricing overtime at the top of my list is consumer deposit. So building a -- we already are a national bank in our asset businesses, and we were a local bank in our funding businesses, and then we acquired our national direct bank. So building out a national bank is fundamentally a central to the success of Capital One.","Now the way most banks overtime, I think envisioned how they are going to grow their deposit businesses and they do it through acquisition. That's not -- acquisitions of other banks. While we have that bank acquisitions in the past and they've been an important part of the strategic and funding migration of our company from a model line specialty finance company. Our future is going to be driven by organic growth of this national bank, and that's different from what most you know players have done.","Now one way to grow deposits is to get on the lead tables and have the highest price and that certainly you know, there's nothing wrong with doing that. Over time what we're trying to do Moshe in a world where there all of banking is centered around one of two poles either people have a branch on every corner with quite low rate deposits or they have a direct bank and are paying you know at the high-end for deposits and our goal is not only to build a national bank but to work backwards from where retail banking is going to go, which I believe is towards thin physical distribution and great digital capabilities and you know attractive products for consumers.","So we're basically trying to figure out know where the market is going to go and just go build that. How will that manifest itself for Capital One and for our financials? Again, very importantly, the funding of the Company but over time increasingly building our company as a franchise, much of it through cross sell through our own very large customer base and to not face the hotter money that's available out there. But in fact really build long-term relationships and end up as really a the one bank that is really a hybrid of the direct bank on one side and the branch in every corner bank on the other side.","And we've seen a lot of traction early on with this. But what we're flagging to investors is, there are a number of reasons that we expect our deposit cost to go up. In the competition most banks are saying that anyway, but in our particular case, the, you know, the mixed effects of this journey and the sort of natural things that happened on the way to building this hybrid bank will be accompanied by higher average deposit costs.","Moshe Orenbuch","And what are the products that you think you'd be able to sell the banks, you know the online bank customers?","Richard Fairbank","Basically, Moshe, we between what is available, so first of all let's talk about capabilities for a second. One of the great challenges for a bank is while here. Most of the world is concluded in I find people that are not close to banking, of course, assuming well of course banks are to be digital, they'll probably be entirely digital. I've come to really respect the importance of them and power of some physical presence. But to challenge that any bank that does have a branch on every corner needs to confront, if you're going to build a deposit franchise is how to -- it is having a full suite of banking capabilities, that you can actually pull-off online or on your phone as opposed to having some of them.","And so, we have taken the whole set of activities that can be done in banking, and the vast majority of virtually all of have been hand sloped by the importance, we have put these online and many of them but not all of them on mobile because we don't want to clutter mobile like a NASCAR uniform with every possible banking feature. But on little cat feet overtime, we have really built out a full banking capability that you don't need to have the local physical distribution now we're going to have some physical distribution and we are just locating that physical distribution in iconic locations. So, it has particular region salience, but with this strategy, we hope to capture some of the best of both worlds from the world of direct banking and of local banking.","But what is just taken in the years that we've taken prior to rolling out our national bank has been of course taking the various tech platforms from the banks that we bought, putting them all together and putting their capability on the cloud and integrated and on the cloud building a -- and now building out a broad-based banking capabilities digitally, building a great and now J.D. Power award-winning for two years in a row banking capability, online banking capability, and importantly also Moshe a credible consistency in our retail banking experience locally. The other thing that we have done is been on the leading end of our branch rationalization, which is very important to the overall economics of this has been physical presence model.","Operator","And our final question tonight comes from Chris Donet with Sandler O' Neil.","Chris Donet","Just wanted to follow up on the that data center migration and think about the journey you've been on starting six years ago and then taking another couple years to get the end. I'm just curious, if you whatever, you had to do it over again. Do you think you could have shortened with that path? Because it seems to me this might be a competitive advantage that anyone else out there is going to have to keep, it's a decade process roughly. Just want to know what you're thoughts, if you could have done it in less time or if that's just how long it takes to redo to like which you talked earlier about the systems and personnel and infrastructure?","Richard Fairbank","Chris, so, we're -- one thing I said is that, well, I denominated our journey in two -- I denominated it in two ways. One is the recent journey which is the six years. We completed six years. We're in our seventh for this technology transformation. Importantly, it stands on the shoulders of Capital One itself and the heritage of what we've built with the talent model, the whole information-based strategy, the data, the analytics, the technology, that went into the whole founding of the Company and sort of who we are.","So what is striking and I appreciate your question is that. On those shoulders, this journey we're already six years in and we're looking ahead to getting, you know, out of our data centers two years you know essentially eight years after beginning the tech transformation at Capital One, which is a bit of an advantaged starting place. I think there are lots of things we learned along the way, but I think if we did it over the journey is really, would be the same because it's a journey that is, it's a talent journey, it's a transforming how software is built.","It's a journey that requires confronting the way that we work and this would be true for any American company that takes this on. Confronting, how the Company works, how people work both on the tech side and you know and across the Company. We have, you know, to take on the entangled infrastructure that exists at large banks, including our own, is a very, very daunting task and to you know set out to rebuild that not from the top of the tech stack but really from the bottom. That is a tough undertaking and it is. I don't think the path could be much shorter than what we've done.","But that's why I say the real news isn't the destination, the news is the journey. And we know we have been all in on this journey and we're in year seven now. And by the way, the last thing I would say is, well, we wouldn't change too much. The one thing that we absolutely would choose to do, is to do this, because we are absolutely compelled by the opportunity here. And we can feel the accelerating progress on just about every dimension, if you were inside this company, you could feel acceleration on what's happening with the customer experience.","What's happening in risk management, what's happening with the dynamism of the Company, the speed to market the products, how customers are feeling about Capital One, the pace of digital adoption by our customers. The momentum around transforming how sort of the operations work, the success in partnerships, I think are tech transformation was central to winning the Walmart deal. And our momentum in the sense of possibility in building a national bank, and finally, the economic, the acceleration of sort of economic opportunities that we have talked about on this call.","A - Jeff Norris","Thanks everyone for joining us on this conference call today.

Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norris","Thanks very much, Leanne, and welcome everybody to Capital One\u2019s 100th quarterly earnings call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the internet. To access the call on the internet, please log on to Capital One\u2019s website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and the financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our third quarter 2019 results.","With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Scott Blackley, Capital One\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Scott will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One\u2019s website, click on Investors, then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements.

Scott?","Scott Blackley","Thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll begin tonight with slide three.","Capital One earned $1.3 billion or $2.69 per share in the third quarter. Net of adjusting items, our EPS in the quarter was $3.32. We had three adjusting items in the quarter, which are outlined on slide 13 of our earnings presentation. There was $212 million or $0.45 per share build in our UK Payment Protection Insurance customer refund reserve in our Credit Card segment, driven by higher-than-expected complaints volume. About $140 of this build was recognized as contra revenue, split across evenly between net and noninterest income, and $72 million was recognized in operating expenses.","The UK regulators previously established a deadline to file PPI complaints, which was August 29, 2019. We received a significantly elevated volume of complaints in the months leading up to the complaint deadline. We are now in the process of determining the eligibility and compensation related to the total complaints.","Next, we had $84 million or $0.14 per share of launch and related integration costs associated with our Walmart partnership in our Domestic Card segment. We continue to expect approximately $225 million of cumulative launch costs with the residual occurring in the fourth quarter.","And finally, we recognized $49 million of charges associated with the cyber incident that we announced at the end of July. These charges were partially offset by an insurance receivable of $27 million, resulting in a net charge of $22 million or $0.04 per share. The timing of recognizing all of the expected insurance reimbursements will lag related charges.","We disclosed last quarter that we expected $100 million to $150 million in certain incremental direct costs associated with the cyber incident response. And then, we expected to record these costs in 2019 and treat them as adjusting items. We now expect to be at the low end of the range, and we expect that some of the adjusting items costs will be incurred in 2020. We continue to expect that a significant portion of these costs will be covered by insurance and that the insurance reimbursements will also be adjusting items. And again, the timing of insurance reimbursements may lag the occurrence of costs.","Beyond the adjusting items, we continue to invest heavily in cyber security, as we have done for years. We expect to make incremental investments in cyber security related to the cyber incident and we expect to absorb the estimated incremental investments within our existing operating efficiency ratio guidance.","Moving to the quarterly results. Relative to a year ago, adjusted pre-provision earnings increased 6% with revenue increasing 4% and non-interest expense growing 3%. Compared to the prior year quarter, provision for credit losses increased 9%, owing to a smaller allowance release and a modest increase in charge-offs. ","Let me take a moment to discuss the quarterly movements in allowance across our businesses, which are detailed in table eight of the earnings supplement.","Our card business on allowance release of $64 million were largely driven by stable underlying credit and the strong economy. In our consumer business, there was release of $48 million, which was driven by our auto business. Reserves in our commercial business increased by $33 million, primarily related to syndicated credits in the energy sector.","Turning the slide four. Net interest margin was 6.73% in the quarter, 28 basis points lower than the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of UK PPI reserve build that I mentioned earlier, net interest margin was 6.81%. The remaining 20 basis points of year-over-year decline was largely driven by higher average deposit costs as we continue to see growth in and mix shift towards our Capital One 360 Deposit products. Going forward, while we continue to keep an eye on interest rates, in the near term, we have a relatively neutral posture to changes in implied forwards.","Turning to slide five, I will cover capital. In the third quarter, we purchased approximately $466 million or 5.3 million common shares of our $2.2 billion 2019 CCAR authorization. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis this quarter was 12.5%. We continue to believe that our long term capital need is around 11% CET1.","Let me take a minute to talk about the factors impacting our capital need. In the 2019 CCAR, the Fed\u2019s implementation of a new card loss model created a headwind to our capital under stress. Conversely, the effects of the recently approved tailoring rule will provide a tailwind to our capital reduction under stress. We also believe there is an opportunity for further capital relief under the stress capital buffer framework. So, we continue to keep an eye on the implementation of CECL and CCAR. How and when the Fed implements these new rules in CCAR will be a key factor in when we will be able to manage the CET1 closer to our 11% long-term capital need.","Let me move on to the new allowance accounting standard. We are preparing to adopt CECL on January 1, 2020. We currently estimate that the implementation of the CECL framework will result in a 30% to 40% increase in our corporate allowance, largely driven by our consumer businesses. As a result, we believe that the impact of adopting CECL, which is phase in over four years, will reduce our 2020 CET1 ratio by 13 basis points to 18 basis points.","I\u2019d like to take a moment to discuss movements in our preferred stock levels. In September, we issued $1.5 billion of Series I preferred stock, which has a 5% dividend that is paid quarterly, subject to Board approval. Additionally, we will redeem our outstanding preferred Series C and D in December, resulting in a one-time charge that will reduce net income available to common shareholders by approximately $30 million. The replacement of Series C and Series D with Series I, will save approximately $15 million per year in ongoing preferred dividend expense.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rich. Rich?","Richard Fairbank","Thanks, Scott. I\u2019ll begin on slide eight, which summarizes third quarter results for our credit card business.","Pretax income for the quarter was $969 million, including the $212 million UK PPI reserve build that\u2019s Scott discussed. Beyond the PPI impact, Credit Card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our Domestic Card business, which is shown on slide nine.","Domestic Card ending loan balances increased by $3.1 billion, or about 3%, compared to the third quarter of last year. Average loans were also up 3%. The growth of Branded Card loans, which exclude private label and co-Branded Cards, continued to accelerate. In the third quarter, Branded Card loans grew 5.7% from the prior year quarter. We posted another quarter of strong purchase volume growth as we continue to grow our heavy spender franchise. Year-over-year, Domestic Card purchase volume growth was 11%. Normalized for two additional processing days in the third quarter of 2019, year-over-year purchase volume growth was about 9%. Net interchange revenue for the total Company grew 11%.","Revenue increased 2% from the third quarter of 2018. Noninterest expense was up 10%. About half of the increase in the noninterest expense was driven by the Walmart adjusting items Scott discussed, as well as some run rate Walmart operating expenses in the quarter. Beyond the Walmart impact, other drivers include continuing technology investments and normal quarterly variability.","Domestic Card credit performance remained stable. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 4.12%, a 23 basis-point improvement year-over-year. The actual improvement was about 10-basis-point, when normalized for the impact of the accelerated recognition of a state charge-off, which added 13 basis points to the charge-off rate in the third quarter a year ago. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 3.71%, down 9 basis points from the prior year quarter.","Pulling up, in the third quarter, our Domestic Card business continued to deliver strong results and gain momentum.","Before moving on to Consumer Banking, I\u2019ll briefly discuss the Walmart partnership. On September 24th, we launched the new Walmart co-brand and private label cards and on October 11th we completed the acquisition of the existing Walmart card portfolio. We on-boarded $8.1 billion in loans. We estimate our initial allowance build to be approximately $85 million, which will be a part of our fourth quarter allowance. We are excited to partner with the world\u2019s largest retailer to deliver compelling products and a great digitally enabled customer experience to Walmart customers.","Other than the adjusting item that Scott discussed, the Walmart partnership did not meaningfully affect third quarter results. Like other card partnerships, we will include Walmart program results as a part of our overall Domestic Card business, rather than break them out separately.","Driven by the revenue and loss sharing provisions, we expect that the acquired Walmart portfolio will affect several Domestic Card metrics. We estimate that the acquired portfolio will reduce the Domestic Card charge-off rate by about 25 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2019 and reduce full-year 2020 charge-off rate by a similar amount with some quarterly variability. We estimate that the acquired portfolio will reduce the Domestic Card revenue margin by about 35 basis points in the fourth quarter, about 50 basis points in the first three quarters of 2020, and after the revenue share on the acquired portfolio steps up in October of next year, about 35 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect the charge-off rate and revenue margin impacts to diminish over time as the acquired portfolio runs off.","Delinquency metrics are not affected by the loss sharing agreement. We estimate that the existing Walmart portfolio will increase Domestic Card delinquency rate by about 25 basis points at the end of the fourth quarter and by about 15 basis points at the end of 2020.","Slide 10 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans increased about 5% compared to the prior year quarter. Average loans grew 3%. In a marketplace with increasing competitive intensity, our auto business delivered strong year-over-year originations growth and a modest acceleration of loan growth, along with stable credit results and a modest pickup in loan yields. Digital innovation is the key driver of our increasing momentum in the auto business.","Ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up 5% versus the prior year quarter with a 31 basis-point increase in average deposit interest rate. The sequential quarter increase in deposit interest rate was 5 basis points. Both increases were primarily driven by deposit mix. Powered by the rollout of our national banking strategy, our deposit growth has been in Capital One 360 products, which has resulted in a product mix shift toward higher rate deposit products. While we expect this mix shift to continue, our average deposit rate going forward will depend on several factors, including the market interest rate environment, our deposit mix and competitive dynamics.","Consumer Banking revenue increased about 3% from the third quarter of last year. Noninterest expense was up less than 1%. Third quarter provision for credit losses increased $19 million year-over-year, primarily because of a smaller allowance release in the third quarter of this year, compared to the allowance release in the third quarter last year.","The auto charge-off rate improved 13 basis points, compared to the prior year quarter to 1.60%. Better-than-expected auction values and a benign economy continue to support strong auto credit. We continue to expect that the annual auto charge-off rate will increase gradually as the cycle plays out.","Moving to slide 11, I\u2019ll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances were up 7% year-over-year, growth in average loans was also 7%. Our growth is concentrated in select industry segments with lower risk, lower margin and the potential to generate fee income over time.","Commercial Bank ending and average deposits were both relatively flat, compared to the prior year. Third quarter revenue was up 1% from the prior year quarter. The revenue benefit of higher average loan balances was offset by lower loan margins. Noninterest expense was also up 1%, compared to the prior year quarter. Provision for credit losses increased, compared to the third quarter of 2018, largely driven by weaknesses in our energy portfolio. About two-thirds of the increase was from higher charge-offs, and as Scott discussed, we also built allowance in our Commercial Banking business.","Outside of the energy portfolio, Commercial Banking credit performance remained strong. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 0.33% and criticized loan rates were relatively stable, compared to both the prior year and sequential quarters. The criticized performing loan rate for the third quarter was 2.8% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.6%. ","Pulling up, we\u2019re keeping a watchful eye on market conditions. Unregulated competitors continue to put pressure on pricing, loan spreads and loan terms for non-banks and banks alike. Against that backdrop, we\u2019re carefully choosing our spots and staying disciplined in our underwriting and origination choices.","Pulling up on the third quarter, Capital One continued to post solid results as we continue to invest to grow and drive our digital transformation. Our marketing and technology investments are building our momentum and creating great value. Our Domestic Card business delivered strong year-over-year growth in purchase volume and Branded Card loans. In our Consumer Banking business, our national advertising, brand and compelling digital customer experience enabled us to post strong year-over-year growth in retail deposits. With the momentum we have in Domestic Cards and retail deposits, we continue to expect full-year marketing for 2019 to be modestly higher than in full-year 2018.","Looking at quarterly trends. Third quarter marketing was flat year-over-year and down slightly sequentially, but that was essentially a timing issue with some planned third quarter marketing shifting to the fourth quarter. We remain all-in on our technology transformation, and our progress continues to accelerate. We continue to expect that we\u2019ll complete the exit of our data centers by the end of 2020, which should generate significant cost and efficiency improvements, beginning in 20201. Until then, we\u2019ll continue to drive for operating efficiency improvement, even with the elevated costs of straddling both the data center and cloud environments.","While the market interest rate environment creates an efficiency headwind for most banks, including Capital One, we still expect to achieve modest improvements in full-year operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments in both 2019 and 2020 with a bigger move down to 42% in 2021. We expect the improvement in 2021 to be aided by the impacts of our datacenter exit and growth in the Walmart partnership revenue, both of which show up in late 2020, as well as continuing technology innovation. And we expect this operating efficiency improvement to drive significant improvement in total efficiency ratio by 2021 as well.","As the many benefits from our technology transformation continue and increase, we are well positioned to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create long-term shareholder value.","Now, Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We\u2019ll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourselves to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Leanne, please start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question today will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Scott, I was hoping to get a little bit more clarity on the NIM expectations going forward. I heard you said you were sort of rate neutral as rates are going down. But, then, you\u2019ve got like the move to 360 and then Walmart. So, as we think through future rate cuts and obviously these moving factors, could you just give us some dimensions on how to think about the NIM migration? And then, I\u2019ll ask my second one upfront. Rich, I know Scott talked about this at a conference, but I just wanted to get your perspective on the cyber security incident. I know there\u2019s been some questions on the cloud migration as a result of it. And I was just wondering if you could just give us your updated views? Thanks.","Scott Blackley","All right, Sanjay. Well, I\u2019ll start off on NIM. So, as I think about where NIM might be headed, I got a few thoughts for you. The first is that we\u2019ve seen deposit rates and mix that have been creating the headwind -- those have been creating the headwind to NIM, since really late last year. Now, those deposits are a great source of stable funding for the Bank, and we\u2019re really happy to have them. More recently though, we\u2019ve been seeing some easing in NIM headwinds from rates and even a bit on mix. So, on the liability side, while we\u2019ve seen some headwinds, starting to see some signs that those are abating a little bit.","And then, on the asset side, Walmart is modestly positive to NIM. Card and auto are growing at attractive rates. And so, on the asset side, we\u2019re certainly seeing some momentum on that end. And then, when you talk about just rates in general, as you mentioned, we have a modest near-term exposure to movements in implied forwards. So, in the near-term, I think that rates aren\u2019t going to be a big driver. So, when I pull up and I look at all the different forces that are impacting NIM from both directions, it doesn\u2019t look to me that any of them are particularly outsized compared to the others.","Richard Fairbank","Sanjay, with respect to the public cloud, and then the cyber incident, while the event occurred in the cloud, the vulnerability that led to our breach is not specific to the cloud, and could have happened in on-premises data center environment. We remain absolutely committed to our digital strategy and our technology transformation, and the public cloud is an essential element of that strategy. I mean, the benefits of the cloud are pretty comprehensive, including agility, innovation, resiliency, security and cost benefits. And in fact, we believe our tech transformation and our move to the cloud in particular, provided some important benefits in this cyber situation. For example, as part of the cloud journey, we were able to tokenize critical data at scale. Also, the cloud was essential to our being able to quickly diagnose and respond to the incident. So, naturally as -- with an event like this, we\u2019re pouring a lot of energy into make sure we get all the learnings and harnessing the energy from an experience like that to really further strengthen cybersecurity and our capabilities broadly across the board. But, we are reminded even through this event of the benefits and power of the public cloud.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please?","Operator","And our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","So, I guess, Scott, I was sort of hoping you could expand a little bit on the deposit pressures that you saw abating on the Consumer Bank, I think they were still kind of going up in the third quarter, albeit, I guess, at lower rate than in Q2. But, like, what areas you\u2019re seeing and what might we see in the balance of the year and into early 2020?","Scott Blackley","Moshe, well, we\u2019ve seen -- when I look at the competitive landscape, we\u2019ve seen a number of competitors who\u2019ve been lowering rates, we\u2019ve had some of our products with lowering rates. And so, we\u2019re starting to see deposits being more responsive to rates going down. And with that we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a reduction to the headwinds that we have been experiencing on NIM.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got you. Just as a follow-up, Rich, you highlighted the acceleration on the credit card balance front. Maybe just kind of give us a little more color there. Obviously the consumer -- this has still kind of continued to grow, but how are you seeing that in terms of balancing growth and risk? ","Richard Fairbank","Yes. So, in our Branded Card business, we separated that out just because that number was quite a bit different from the overall kind of Domestic Card number, but it\u2019s a reflection of the continued traction that we\u2019re getting across the board. And I think, it\u2019s -- the continuing success we\u2019re having in marketing, the traction we\u2019re having at the top of the marketplace in our spender business, but also we continue to have traction really across the board. That traction is coming from continued strong origination of accounts but also continuing to lean in a little bit more each quarter on the credit line just as we continue to validate by looking in the -- at the performance of recent vintages and continue with an eye on the economy. All of that is contributing to some acceleration on the Branded Card growth.","With respect to the consumer, how do we feel about that? I think, the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer is in pretty good shape. Consumers are obviously benefiting from strong labor market, rising wages, and last year\u2019s tax cuts, all of which are driving up disposable incomes. The savings rate is solid, the rate of borrowing is reasonable, debt servicing burdens are stable and well below the levels that we saw before the great recession. Retail sales growth is down a bit from a year ago but still solid.","When we look inside our portfolio, we see that delinquencies and charge-off rates are low, payment rates are -- continue to sort of gradually rise. And that is sort of the flip side of or another manifestation of credit strength and the confidence and strength of the consumer. One metric we watch as a leading indicator is the proportion of customers who are paying only the minimum payment on their cards and over the past year, that metric has been stable to slightly improving.","Now, of course, the consumer is a resident in our broader economy and not only the U.S. but the world economy, and implications of things like growing government deficit, trade related issues, and the intense political environment are something we certainly keep an eye on.","There is also pockets within lending that we are watching, such as installment loans. Installment loans are growing at 15%, and some lenders are not reporting to the credit bureaus. So, I\u2019m not sure that we actually know the size of that number, but we know it\u2019s pretty bank, and that can have -- we\u2019re not in the installment loan business, but we can be affected by those things, so. And most importantly, it\u2019s not loss on us, we\u2019re deep into the economic cycle, and we underwrite with the focus on resilience. And if you pull way up what that means is, while still being very obsessive about those, about the risks out there, we continue to see an opportunity to grow our business, we see stability in the consumer and on the credit side, and that augurs well for continued opportunity in card.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please?","Operator","And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the outlook comments that you gave you around the back book Walmart portfolio and wanted to understand how you are thinking about the K rate of $8.1 billion, over how many years we should expect that to take? And then, the second thing was, I know you gave a lot of color on the NCS delinquencies and the revenue margin. How do you see that trajecting in that 13, 14 months because you have difference set up, right, economically with Walmart than the first 12 to 13 months and month 13 on, maybe you could go through your broader outlook as well. Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","Okay. So, Betsy, the Walmart -- all of our guidance about how the metrics were going to be affected is, I want to stress, as you indicated, it\u2019s about the portfolio that we bought from Walmart. We of course also are originating business with Walmart, but that\u2019s much more of a kind of business as usual thing, and the impact on the metrics will be much more in the business as usual category. This portfolio stands out for a number of reasons. I mean, it\u2019s all at one moment; it arrives on our balance sheet. So, we want to deflate what happens with the metrics. This is also a portfolio with a significant loss share as well as a revenue share, and it has some pretty striking impacts on some of the metrics that we outlined.","It is a portfolio that historically has had a -- the runoff rate, the attrition rate starts with the pretty high charge-off rate that we talk about in that. And then, of course there is natural attrition as well. So, we are inheriting a portfolio that runs off reasonably quickly, if you isolate it from new originations, which we are here with this guidance. The one thing that makes it kind of hard to predict how fast the attrition will go is that this value proposition, including 5% on walmart.com, 2% off on everything bought in the store, this is a significant improvement in the value proposition relative to what the customers had before. And we are giving that to all existing customers of this portfolio.","So, hopefully that will help on the nutrition side. We don\u2019t have any data on that. But, what we wanted to stress is that the impact on our metrics will happen all at once, like we talked about. And then, we should we should all assume a run-off, a gradual run-off of that driven especially by the fairly high charge-off rate.","The only other event of note is the step-up in the revenue share that happens with respect to this portfolio starting in October of 2020. So, that\u2019s a single event, and we will be the beneficiary of a higher revenue share, same loss year, but a higher revenue share and that will continue over the life of the portfolio. That\u2019s why we gave our guidance in a series of steps.","The only other thing that I wanted to just savor, the delinquency -- I know everybody looks with -- understandably with a magnifying glass at delinquency and credit -- and charge-off numbers, and it\u2019s really important to us that we were able to talk about the differential impacts that come from that back book. The charge-off numbers will be net charge-off numbers because we are reporting only the charge-offs for our loss share portion of the total charge-offs. The delinquencies, we -- this on our balance sheet, so, we have the entire -- the delinquencies, we will report in their entirety, even though an important portion of the losses will be taken by Walmart. So, that\u2019s why particularly on the delinquency side, there will be some striking impacts that we wanted to flag.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please?","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.","Eric Wasserstrom","Just one quick clarification and then I have a real question. Just on the PPI, given the August deadline has now passed, is this the end of the builder or could this -- could you see incremental building into the fourth quarter?","Scott Blackley","So, as I outlined in my prepared remarks, the deadline was, as you mentioned, August 29, 2019, and we\u2019ve now passed that PPI deadline. So, we now know the total volume of complaints that we can receive. What we\u2019re doing right now is going through all those complaints and trying to determine which of them are valid complaints and what the appropriate level of compensation is on those complaints. That process, given the elevated level of claims that we incurred, is going to take around six months to complete. The reserve that we built on in this quarter, we included an estimate of how many of those claims we thought would be valid and the portion of compensation that we would have to pay. We did that based on kind of our history of what we\u2019ve seen. It stands to reason that when you have a spike in claims right before a deadline, you may not have as many claims that are valid as you\u2019ve seen over a long history. But, we didn\u2019t take that into account. So, we feel, at this point, well-reserved for everything we know, and we\u2019re not going to be getting any claims.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. That\u2019s very clear. Thank you. And then, my real question is about the marketing spend. It was about a year ago that, Rich, you signaled that you\u2019re entering this investment cycle. And, I would just love to get an update on how you\u2019re feeling about the efficacy of that spend at this point and sort of what the short to medium term outlook might be as we look to the New Year?","Richard Fairbank","Eric, it continues to be a very positive story for us. We -- in card, the marketing is strengthening our heavy spender franchise, it\u2019s driving strong growth in new accounts, purchase volume, net interchange revenue, and now increasingly loans as well. On the bank side, the increased marketing is really basically the tip of the spear of our organically building a national bank. And that\u2019s fueling deposit growth and also moving a lot of the sort of metrics associated with cafes and our brand on the national banking side. In fact, speaking of brand, this is one of the big beneficiaries overall of the marketing that we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re seeing a lot of traction across the Company and our brand metrics in hard to move brand equities that really are critical to building a franchise.","So, we continue to be enthusiastic as we have been for a number of months. One thing that\u2019s just a little different versus a year ago, we had such a big step up because we were launching a couple of new programs. But, we don\u2019t have that at this very moment, new launches, but except of course, Walmart here. But we continue to be bullish. And in fact, now that I mentioned Walmart, we will be sharing with Walmart a pretty active and positive campaign associated with this card. And, again, we will be underwriting a portion of that.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please?","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","Question on CECL. It\u2019s interesting with all the talk about the impacts over the last year. So, really the increase isn\u2019t too bad for you, not that dissimilar actually from Amex. And I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the offsets, I guess, maybe on your commercial side of your portfolio? And then, Scott, is it fair to say there\u2019s only a pretty modest impact downward biased in terms of the impact to GAAP 2020 CECL and without CECL?","Richard Fairbank","Yes. Let me just start off kind of talking about the longer term impacts of CECL. So, obviously, CECL creates a onetime reduction in our capital ratios that adoption, and it\u2019s permanently increasing the amount of capital that we\u2019ll hold against those losses. In terms of future allowance builds, I think, in times of slow and stable growth, a stable economic outlook, I\u2019d expect that CECL is going to look fairly similar to what we see with allowance moves today. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ll see a lot of violence then. However, I think when you see periods of accelerated growth, significant changes in the economic outlook, I feel confident that we\u2019re going to see amplified allowance moves and increased provision volatility. So, when I pull up, I think, it\u2019s completely appropriate just to mention that CECL is not going to change the way that we approach our businesses and how we conduct the business of lending.","I kind of look back at the fact that, we don\u2019t yet know how the Fed will incorporate CECL and the CCAR, that\u2019s still a few years away. Ultimately that could impact capital levels for us and for all banks.","And the other thing I\u2019d say is, as we\u2019ve been saying, I think in periods of stress, in a deep recession, I continue to be worried that CECL will make it more difficult for the banking industry to lend, when you have to record lifetime expected losses before you get to report any of the related revenue. And so, you know I\u2019m anxious about that.","And then, Don, to your other question about the puts and takes, it\u2019s really difficult to unpack other banks\u2019 CECL disclosures. I don\u2019t really have good insights to what\u2019s driving their CECL numbers. I can tell you that our 30% to 40% estimate of the increase in allowance and adoption represents our balance sheet mix, the business practices that we follow and the accounting policy elections that we\u2019ve made. And in order of magnitude, on the initial adoption of CECL from lowest to highest, commercial is the lowest, card is the second, and then auto is third. And that\u2019s in terms of magnitude of the allowance build from lowest to highest.","Don Fandetti","Okay. And then, one last on shifting to auto, how are origination yields? Are they holding up pretty well? It looks like yields are coming in obviously still above the portfolio yield. And have you seen any shift in competition? It looks like your subprime mix continues to go up a tiny bit in auto.","Richard Fairbank","Yes. So, the auto -- the competitive environment is -- continues to be -- it\u2019s pretty intense, but it still offers I think quite a bit of opportunity. Let me talk about the parts of the marketplace. In subprime auto, we\u2019ve seen a rapid growth actually of small independent lenders, although they are more focused on deep subprime, high-loss business. We also see some increased competition from some lenders who had previously pulled back. And we remain vigilant on that, but definitely the subprime opportunity is there.","In near-prime, the competition from some who had pulled back in the past, certainly has intensified quite a bit. We still see opportunity, but it\u2019s definitely intense, the competition there. And in the prime market, we have seen some reversal in the trend of increasing market share of credit unions, although the market continues to be competitive.","When we look at margins in general, the margins have -- are actually pretty healthy, and even a little healthier in prime than they have been in some past periods. So, we continue to see a growth opportunity. I would just also say that while we don\u2019t have any way to quantify this, I think, we have been benefited by the technology investments that we have made in the business. Investments on the underwriting side, the sort of real time -- creating real time underwriting and real time pricing capabilities that are enabled by our cloud strategy and our overall technology transformation, in product design, in sort of things to help dealers and things to make our operation be just so much more effective in real time. And all of these are things we\u2019ve worked hard to create. I think, they\u2019re very beneficial. They don\u2019t transcend the competitive and cycle conditions that will still dominate our metrics. But, I think underneath it all, there\u2019s a growing strength that we have in the auto business and just one of the many benefits that is growing related to our tech transformation.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please?","Operator","And our next question will come from Rick Shane with JP Morgan.","Rick Shane","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was actually a little worried I wouldn\u2019t get to participate on the 100th call. Congratulations. It\u2019s really quite an achievement. Just one clarification. Scott, you\u2019ve talked about the CECL reserve, and I just want to make sure that we all understand that in the context of the Walmart acquisition. Should we think of that 30% to 40% increase not as versus September 30th but a day zero to day one change?","Richard Fairbank","Yes. You should think of that as our estimate for the January 1, 2020 adoption, which would include all of the assets that are on balance sheet as of that date. So, Walmart would be included in that as with all of the other assets at that point.","Rick Shane","Okay. Most of the companies we follow talked about in the context of September 30th. I just wanted to make sure, given the sizable acquisition, we\u2019re thinking about that in the right way. That\u2019s it for me\u2026","Richard Fairbank","We\u2019ve tried to make an estimate for the total impact of the Company, given kind of where we are and where we would expect to be.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please?","Operator","And our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffrey.","Kevin Barker","Just to follow up on some of the comments around NIM, and some of your -- the explanation you gave going forward use. Could you help understand where you see the trajectory of the securities portfolio, especially with a little bit of stabilization at 10-year that we\u2019ve seen recently?","Richard Fairbank","Yes. Just a few thoughts there. So, NIM in the quarter was pretty modestly impacted by the fact that we were holding some additional cash on Walmart in preparation for acquiring the Walmart portfolio. So, we will be -- as we go ahead and have executed that will be replacing that with the higher yielding assets of the Walmart portfolio. So, that\u2019s going to be a net positive in terms of the trajectory of NIM.","In terms of the securities portfolio, it\u2019s been trending down a little bit which is mainly a liquidity assessment terms of what we need for liquidity in that portfolio. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a significant change to NIM in terms of what we see coming out of that portfolio.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Was there any outsized amount of premium amortization this quarter? And, could you give us an idea of where your new money yields are on the securities portfolio?","Richard Fairbank","I don\u2019t think that in terms of -- I don\u2019t think, there\u2019s really anything meaningful in any of those areas for me to share with you in terms of the impact on the quarter, going forward.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please?","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Hogan with William Blair.","Brian Hogan","Thank you. My first question is actually on the growth of your employee base. So, it\u2019s been accelerating, and it was up 9.5% year-over-year. And I guess, I mean, in conjunction with your shift to technology and focus on that digital transformation. So, I guess, why the significant growth in personnel, what are they doing? What are your investments in that?","Scott Blackley","Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Scott. I think the thing that\u2019s probably most impactful right now on headcount is that we\u2019re ramping up for the Walmart launch and integration. We started doing that a couple quarters ago. That\u2019s really been the largest growth in headcount most recently. And as you mentioned that our technology investments in work there have been over time than adding to total headcount. But, I think just in general, the growth of the Company and Walmart have been a major factor as well.","Brian Hogan","Should we expect that to level off that, right?","Scott Blackley","Well, in terms of the Walmart personnel, that\u2019s a group that we have brought on to deal with that account. So, I would expect that we wouldn\u2019t have further increases in headcount associated with Walmart, and then the rest of kind of the trajectory there is going to be driven by normal business activity.","Richard Fairbank","Brian, but to your point, the 42 by 21, a 1aenabler of that. And in fact, without this, we wouldn\u2019t be same 42 by 21. A central enabler of this is the benefits that have come from our heavy all-in tech transformation where we are approaching the end of the seventh year of our tech transformation. And, for much of that transformation, it costs more before it costs less. And we continue to invest and we will invest on a continuing basis. Because, I think increasingly, technology is what a sort of tech company does. But that said, our confidence to shingle ourselves as far in advances did to some pretty bold efficiency ratio target is powered by efficiencies that come from the tech investments and cost saving -- on the cost saving opportunities from changing how we work, driving customers to digital, driving really the company to digital, driving down technology costs themselves as we move away from a lot of expensive proprietary technology as we consolidate our technology, reduce a lot of duplication and really moved to just a better way of operating. So, just wanted to mention that.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please?","Operator","And our next question will be from Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran","Hi. I mean, you\u2019ve addressed a lot already. I mean, maybe -- I guess, I\u2019m only struck by people are always focused on your overall tone on this conference calls. And if I just kind of go down the things that matter, I mean, since like you are feeling a little better about some of the leading indicators on credit, a little better online size increases and thus branded card growth, little less worries on the interest rates, still confident on the OpEx. And maybe I\u2019m over-reading it, but it felt like maybe the excess capital position was becoming a little bit clearer, less uncertainty there. I mean, is it fair, if someone just asks, was Capital One more or less positive? I mean, it sounds like you are a little bit more positive on all the key fronts. Is that a fair assessment or are there some negatives that maybe I\u2019m leaving out?","Richard Fairbank","Brian, I think, I was writing it down as you were doing it, going over credit, and yes, the line increases. I mean, again, we\u2019re still in the overall motive of cautious where we\u2019re in the economy, but line increases, check. I would add continuing bullishness about the marketing and the success, the traction in the card business overall. Interest rates, now again, on interest rates, it\u2019s hard to be bullish on that. But, we are -- relative to the some of the seismic impacts that have happened in interest rates, I think the combination of how the market\u2019s responding and the tools that we have in our portfolio to adapt, I think, we have increasing bullishness about that.","Operating expenses, if you pull up the kind of -- our point was that we got delta curve ball that wasn\u2019t in our plans, when we announced the 42x21. I remember the meeting when we first -- somebody brought in, well, this is going to be the impact, the sort of gross impact of this on what could be with respect to revenues on interest rates. And after we caught our breath, we continued to just work incredibly hard and the traction on operating expenses and all matters around the efficiency ratio continues to be positive such that despite the interest rate move, we are continuing to reaffirm our guidance of the capital. There is a strong excess capital thing position there.","And the other one I would add on the list is the continued -- you can feel it inside the Company. It\u2019s hard for the outside world to see this, partly because we don\u2019t always proclaim some of the things that are proprietary that we\u2019re doing. But, the tech transformation that started at the bottom of the technology stack, a place that is the hardest work, shows the least immediate payoff. And in fact if you selectively transform yourself in the bottom of the technology stack, it doesn\u2019t really do much for you. But I\u2019ve said over the years, and in the end, I know really the proof ultimately is in the pudding and what investors see.","But, what I want to say is it\u2019s a very the unusual thing that Capital One has done by so heavily starting at the bottom of the tech stack and working up. I think, most companies when they do the tech transformation start at the top of the tech stack, meaning innovating on the part of the technology that is customer or associate facing. And it\u2019s very natural thing to do because that\u2019s by definition the only thing that people can see and that\u2019s where competitors put pressure, customers are clamoring, et cetera. But, we have been transforming from the bottom of the technology stack.","But as we continue to move up the tech stack, more and more will be visible over time, the benefits will become greater, the agility greater and the opportunity to create great things at the top of the tech stack, the ability to transform how we work, the ability to make some significant differentiated capabilities on the risk management side, and ultimately to create a great customer experience and better and better economics. That is what we\u2019ve been driving for, for years. And I think we continue to have a bullishness about that. So, what\u2019s the yikers is along the way is just a lot of work. There are a lot of things that happen on the way to work but this is we continue to feel an increase in momentum on these things that are long time in the making, but I think, they are at the heart of winning in the very different place where the world is going.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please?","Operator","And our final question this evening comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Chris Donat","I just want to ask about the pricing strategy for Capital One 360 in an environment where you have seen some of the large,, call them cyber deposit gatherers decrease their rates. How do you feel about strategy in terms of both, competitors and in terms of Fed funds and other benchmarks as far as -- what factors really determine where you set that deposit rate?","Richard Fairbank","Well, Chris, it would be a fairly straightforward thing. I wouldn\u2019t know. I\u2019d never use the word easy but it would be a fairly straightforward thing to build a direct bank that goes to the top of bank rate monitor and builds deposits that way. And what -- that\u2019s not the business that we have wanted to build. And the term I always use is we want to build a franchise. And that\u2019s a much higher calling. And, there\u2019s a lot that goes into that. But, one of the benefits over time of building a franchise is one doesn\u2019t have to chase rates at the top of the marketplace, but rather is providing really good deals for people who believe in the Company and where we can have enduring relationships. And that\u2019s what this has been about.","So, with every passing year, we partly measure our success by how far we\u2019re able to distance ourselves from just the very -- the players who are just absolutely chasing race at the top of the rate table. And that\u2019s not only an economic benefit, but it actually really helps in terms of the kind of customers that we\u2019re attracting, the selection dynamics that are critical in terms of the longevity of the deposits themselves. So, we have -- so that sort of the already the state of mind and where we have been. As now a new thing comes along which is the bottom falls out of the interest rate marketplace. We have noticed a number of players on the direct space moved. We also lowered our price at the end of the quarter. And we will continue to watch the marketplace. But we certainly -- our strategy is not to chase the hot money. Our strategy is really to provide great deals to consumers and have the streamlined economics and the digital model to support that. And that\u2019s what we will continue to do. And that -- I think it will serve us well through this part of the cycle and I think over the longer term.","Jeff Norris","Well, that concludes our question-and-answer period and our call for this evening. Thank you for joining us on this conference call today and for your continuing interest in Capital One. As a reminder, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening, if you have further questions. Thanks, everyone. Have a great evening.","End of Q&A","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"4268":["Capital One Financial Corp.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President-Global Finance","Thanks very much, Nancy, and welcome, everybody to Capital One's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. If you'd like to access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2015 results. With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Steve Crawford, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Steve will walk you through the presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements and for more information on these factors, please see the section titled forward-looking information in the earnings release presentation and the risk factor section in our annual and quarterly reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC.","With that I'll turn the call over to Mr. Crawford. Steve?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jeff. For the second quarter Capital One earned $830 million, or $1.50 per share, and had a return on average tangible common equity of 11%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.48 per share. Net income was down $285 million driven by lower linked quarter pre-provision earnings and higher provision expense. Pre-provision earnings decreased by $233 million versus the prior quarter as higher revenue was more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses. Provision for credit losses increased on a linked-quarter basis as lower charge-offs were offset by a larger allowance build.","We had non-recurring costs of $225 million in the quarter. We have included an appendix slide in our earnings presentation available on our website illustrating the impacts from these items to key line items and ratios in the quarter. Non-recurring charges include: restructuring expense of $147 million related to the realignment of our workforce that we recently announced internally. We expect a modest amount of incremental non-recurring charges later this year from site closures related to this activity.","We also added $78 million to our U.K. PPI reserve of which $37 million was captured as a contra revenue item and $41 million was captured in non-interest expense. The increase in our U.K. PPI reserve is driven by complaint volumes declining more slowly than we had previously estimated. The refund of PPI fees and interest is an industry-wide issue and there continues to be uncertainty as to how these exposures will play out.","Estimating future complaint levels is difficult and there is the potential that more complaints will be filed in the future than we are currently estimating. As always, our 10-Q will provide further details on the factors we consider in estimating our reserve. Excluding the impact from the restructuring charges and the build in U.K. PPI reserve, earnings per share in the quarter were $1.78 and our efficiency ratio was 54.6%.","Turning to another legal matter. In the quarter we recorded a $36 million benefit from reducing our reserve for representation and warranty claims. This reduction was driven by a recent High Court ruling in New York regarding the application of statute of limitations. We also expect that the ruling will result in a decrease to our reasonably profitable rep and warranty exposure by approximately $500 million from the level reported in March of 2015, but that calculation will not be finalized until the 10-Q is filed next month.","As outlined on slide four, reported NIM decreased 1 basis point in the second quarter to 6.56% as lower investment securities and loan yields were partially offset by lower cash balances and additional day to recognize revenue in the second quarter. We continue to be above the fully phased in LCR requirements as of June 30, 2015.","On slide five you can see our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 12.1%. On a fully phased in basis we estimate this ratio would be approximately 11.8%. We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 5.5 million shares, or 1%, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We entered parallel run for Basel III Advanced Approaches on January 1 and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target.","Let me now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on slide seven with our Domestic Card business. Strong loan growth continued in the quarter. Ending loans were up 11% year-over-year and average loans grew 9%. We continue to see attractive opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focused on for some time.","Purchase volume on general purpose credit cards, which excludes private label cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew 20% year-over-year. The success of our rewards programs increased new account originations, and credit line increases continued to drive purchase volume growth. Revenue increased 8% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis revenue margin decreased 12 basis points driven by the change in our finance charge and fee reserve, which swung from a modest credit-driven release in the first quarter to a modest growth related build in the second quarter. The Domestic Card revenue margin remains healthy at 16.8%.","As you know, we stopped selling payment protection to new customers in the U.S. in 2012, but we allowed existing customers to keep the product. Since then, our revenue margin has absorbed a small drag as the back book of payment protection has been gradually running off as a result of account attrition, charge-offs and cancellations. Payment protection is expected to contribute about 25 basis points to the full-year 2015 revenue margin and has been declining by an average of about 10 basis points a year. As we continue to simplify our operations to focus on our core offerings, we believe it is the right time to fully exit the back book, which we expect to largely complete in the first quarter of 2016. We expect the contribution to revenue margin to essentially go to zero by the second quarter of 2016.","Year-over-year non-interest expense increased 7% driven by higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments. Credit in the second quarter was driven by expected seasonal improvements. The charge-off rate improved 13 basis points to 3.42%. The delinquency rate improved eight basis points to 2.84%. Recall that last quarter we experienced better than forecasted delinquency flow rates. As first quarter delinquency favorability rolls through to charge-offs, we expect quarterly charge-off rate to be around 3% at the third quarter seasonal low point. Longer-term, our credit expectations are unchanged and are driven by growth math. As new loan balances season, they put upward pressure on losses. We still expect growth math to drive quarterly charge-off rate to be in the mid-to-high 3% range in the fourth quarter and higher from there in 2016. Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the quarter and we expect these same factors to drive allowance additions going forward.","Slide eight summarizes second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were flat compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto originations increased about 1% year-over-year and 5% from the linked quarter. Consumer Banking revenue was up 2% year-over-year driven by growth in auto loans. Revenue continued to be pressured by persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto.","Non-interest expense increased 6% year-over-year driven by infrastructure and technology expenses in retail banking and growth in auto loans. Provision for credit losses grew $42 million year-over-year to $185 million. Growth in auto loans and normalizing auto credit resulted in higher year-over-year charge-off expense.","In our auto business used vehicle values have softened, although they remain near historically high levels. A decline in used car prices would put pressure on our results. We've discussed increased competition in pricing and underwriting for some time. In the second quarter we observed increasingly aggressive underwriting practices by some of our competitors, particularly in subprime. We are losing some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. As a result, subprime originations declined modestly compared to the prior year. We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our longstanding focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers.","Our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing headwinds. Persistently low interest rates will pressure returns in our deposit businesses, even if rates begin to rise in 2015. Planned home loans runoff continues and auto loan growth is slowing and margins are compressing from once-in-a-lifetime levels. We expect these trends will negatively affect revenues and efficiency ratio in the second half of 2015 and 2016.","Moving to slide nine, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased 6% year-over-year and 1% from the linked quarter with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals in C&I. Average loan balances were up 8% year-over-year. As we've been signaling, our growth is slowing compared to prior years because of choices we're making in response to market conditions. While increasing competition, pressuring loan terms and pricing in CRE and plain vanilla C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty verticals in C&I.","Revenues increased 8% from the prior year driven by growth in average loans as well as increased fee income from agency multi-family originations. These factors were partially offset by loan yields, which declined 24 basis points compared to the prior year driven by increased competition. Loan yields increased modestly from the linked quarter. Provision for credit losses increased $37 million from the prior year to $49 million driven by allowance build. We built allowance over the last three quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans. In the second quarter criticized non-performing loans were up $282 million from the prior year to $463 million and the NPL rate increased about 50 basis points to 0.90%. These trends were driven by downgrades of oil and gas loans and to a lesser extent downgrades of taxi medallion loans. Second quarter credit results include the final results of the Shared National Credit's exam.","We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia, we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. Of our approximately $3.4 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans, our largest exposure is in exploration and production and our second largest exposure is in oil field services. Our taxi medallion loan portfolio is less than $1 billion in loans. In the face of growing competition from Uber and other entrants, taxi medallion values continue to decline and we're closely watching this sector.","I'll conclude tonight on slide 10. Capital One posted solid results in the second quarter, highlighted by strong growth in our Domestic Card business. We're delivering attractive, risk-adjusted returns today and investing to sustain growth and returns over the long term. We remain compelled by the opportunity, need and urgency of digital transformation. We are entering a mobile, on-demand, real-time world. Digital has already disrupted many businesses and has created entirely new industries. The pace of disruption is sweeping, breathtaking and accelerating. Banking is inherently a digital business and is ripe for transformation.","To win in the digital world, we can't simply bolt digital onto the side of our existing business or port analog banking services to digital channels. Technology and information will fundamentally change how banking works and unlock new capabilities and the ability to deliver entirely new experiences. To fully capture these benefits, we're deeply embedding digital into our businesses. We're becoming a destination for great digital talent; product managers, designers, engineers and data scientists. We're simplifying and modernizing our infrastructure to drive agility across the company. We're building foundational capabilities around software development, design and information and we're transforming the way we work to unleash the power of modern technology and great talent to drive innovation.","We are making significant investments in our digital future. We don't build technology for technologies sake. We are working backwards from a future where the vast majority of interactions with our customers will be digital. We are already seeing the payoff. Our digital investments are creating a compelling customer experience, delivering data-driven insights and are a key enabler of the strong growth we are delivering.","We continue to see strong growth opportunities across our Domestic Card business. We believe that the right choice to drive long-term value is to spend marketing and operating expense to capitalize on this window of opportunity. Taken together, digital transformation, Domestic Card growth opportunities, and rising industry regulatory requirements drive our investment levels, and we believe all three are strategic imperatives that are critical to long-term value creation.","Last quarter we indicated that full-year 2015 efficiency ratio could be modestly above 54.5%, driven by incremental marketing and growth-related operating expenses. With strong Domestic Card growth opportunities continuing, we now expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio to be around 55%, excluding non-recurring items.","While it's difficult to predict next year's efficiency ratio 18 months in advance, we can see a number of factors which will affect it. We expect the 2016 efficiency ratio will benefit from recent Card growth and recent cost moves, but the continuing investments in growth, digital and regulatory as well as the revenue pressures in auto and retail banking are expected to put upward pressure on efficiency ratio. Net-net and excluding non-recurring items, we don't expect much improvement in 2016 efficiency ratio relative to full year 2015.","We're managing expenses tightly with the goal of offsetting digital investment, growth and regulatory expenditures as best we can with savings in other areas. One example in the second quarter is the choice we made to restructure our workforce as we become a more digital company.","Pulling up, Capital One is well positioned to sustain attractive shareholder returns. Over the near term we've positioned Capital One to deliver financial performance with the following characteristics: strong revenue growth driven by growth in loans, pre-provision earnings growth more or less in line with revenue growth, higher provision for credit losses creating headwinds for net income, and significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval with share repurchases reducing share count and aiding earnings per share.","Now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President-Global Finance","Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up question. And if you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Nancy, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good evening, guys. Can you maybe just help us better understand the growth math? It seemed like the provision build was significantly higher than any of us had expected coming into the quarter. So, Steve, maybe you could just walk us through the outlook for charge-offs, expectations for growth and maybe help us just understand the qualitative component. Should we be thinking about a ramp in provisions from here given the growth that you've generated? Or do you think we're finally getting to the point that provisions could be commensurate with the loan growth profile?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Ryan, hopefully this will be a repeat to what we've been talking about for a while, but I think as you say, it continues to be a source of difference. So let me talk in particular because most of this is driven by Card and focus there. As we've mentioned, our allowance is built off of three components: the loan balances at the end of the period, our 12-month forecast going forward, and qualitative factors for risks that aren't covered in the models.","As mentioned, and we've talked about this for a while, we're in a growth period for Card. So that growth, all else equal, is going to be pushing up the allowance. And even more precisely we've given you a sense for what's going to happen to charge-offs. Our current allowance right now includes the \u2013 if you think about it, there's a rotation that happens every quarter. Our current allowance includes expectations for low NACO losses in the third quarter of 2015. We talked in our guidance of around 3%. And if you think about it, at the end of next quarter we will replace the third quarter of 2015 with the third quarter of 2016.","Remember we have guided now consistently \u2013 there's not been a change in outlook for our loss content in Card. We've guided consistently over the last couple of quarters that we're going to be in the mid-to-high 3% in the fourth quarter of 2015 and higher from there. So all else equal, even before loan growth, just a quarter swap would mean an allowance build next quarter. And the same thing happened you can talk about this quarter. Now I always have to put in that qualifier of all else equal. Changes to our underlying loss expectations can have a real impact on allowance build because it happens over the next kind of four quarters. So it's really the combination of growth and our outlook for charge-offs that's going to ultimately work its way into changes in allowance.","Operator","And we'll go to the next question that comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. I guess you guys have been seeing some good growth in Card. Could you just maybe talk about the types of growth you're seeing, what kind of competition you're seeing, what the loss content of that growth is because that kind of ties into the allowance question? And I'll ask my second question upfront. I guess there's some changes to the CCAR approach as far as the Advanced Approach is concerned. Maybe, Steve, you could just talk about how that might impact you. Thanks.","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Do you want me to go first on the capital?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","(23:56) sure, okay.","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Yes, look, I think the two things that kind of apply to us are they're going to move away from the old Tier 1 common ratio. That's not a big impact for us on CCAR. The other thing is at least for now it feels like CCAR and Advanced Approaches have been delayed indefinitely and that added more uncertainty, which we've talked about. So those are the two things that will impact us. Obviously it's not a model that we can control and we can't predict entirely what the changes are going be year-over-year, but on balance the biggest change was probably knowing for some period of time there will not be a combination of CCAR and Advanced Approaches. Rich?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Sanjay, the growth in the Card business is a very similar story to what we've been saying for some time now. We're seeing good opportunities and growth across the segments that we are growing and that we are investing in. In our Card business the loss content is similar to originations we've been doing for quite some time. The losses of new originations are higher than our highly-seasoned back book just because that back book was profoundly seasoned by anybody who survived the great recession and the very extended period of low originations for us and in many ways for the industry. So off of an unusually low loss back book, we are seeing very good origination opportunities and it's really more of the same that you've seen from us for a long period of time.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President-Global Finance","Next question please.","Operator","Yes. And we'll go next to Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I just wanted to clarify one question on provision and then I have a question about the net interest margin. There was a reserve build in the Commercial segment, but is that also given the dynamics that you just went through, Steve, as they relate to car, are they similar for Commercial given what's going on there in terms of some of the credit stress?","And then my margin question is, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes in terms of what's going on in yields across the different product areas and maybe what's going on in cost of funds? Thank you.","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","So the provision in commercial, the drivers of that are primarily the energy and taxi remarks that Rich made earlier. And I'm sorry, the next question was \u2013 what was the question on net interest margin?","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","It was just largely about if you could give us some insights into what's going on in terms of yield expectations and what's going on in terms of your cost of funds expectations?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Well, there's kind of plusses and minuses and a lot of it obviously depends on which side of the balance sheet you're talking about. I mean, in general on the positive side we've moved to a higher mix in Card. That's probably been something that's been a help to net interest margin. I would say yields more generally across the portfolio have been going in the opposite direction.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President-Global Finance","Next question please.","Operator","Yes. The next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Rich, you mentioned sub-prime auto competition again this quarter. And I was curious if you're seeing is it an across-the-board pickup in terms of aggressive activity? Or is it more one player because obviously where one participant that's had some strategic changes that has led them to get more active if you could comment on that.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's not across the board. It's a little more isolated, but it's a similar phenomenon we've been talking about for some time, but we, of course, are making the choice to be very consistent with our own underwriting here.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And just lastly, are you seeing any impact at all from the online marketplace lenders? My sense is probably not, but I just wanted to check on that.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I mean, we're intrigued with frankly all of the startups in the financial services space, one category of which is the online lending and peer-to-peer lending and so on. The numbers involved are small relative to the magnitude of the balance sheets and originations. To most of us it would be probably hard to see that. I also do want to point out that most of this lending on the consumer side is focused on installment lending and that's not an area we're doing a lot of origination in. So we certainly don't see any direct effect. It would be hard to measure indirect effect. But even though we may not see much of an effect, we certainly have a real interest in watching what goes on in that space.","Operator","We'll go to the next question and it comes from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon. Just wanted to talk about the 2016 efficiency ratio a little more. A little surprised that it would stay elevated relative to already increased levels for 2015, particularly in light of your asset sensitivity and obviously some growth in digital that should lower your cost of acquisition. Do you see more flexibility in the event that revenue pressures persist on the cost side, maybe in retail banking or across other areas of the business?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me say a few things about the efficiency ratio. As you know and probably looking at our own conversation over the course of this year, it's hard to precisely predict efficiency ratio, but what we wanted to give investors a sense of that there really are tailwinds and headwinds that are competing pretty strongly with each other. And the recent growth that we've done in the card business, for example, is certainly a positive force. Offsetting that, of course, is the \u2013 what we'll do in terms of investing in card growth during the year next year. And a pretty big component is the digital investment as well and some of the other things that I mentioned. The \u2013 in terms of how these play out, the card growth will ultimately be beneficial to efficiency ratio as growth moderates. And the investment in digital \u2013 a lot of banks are talking about digital in the language of whether the expenditure \u2013 how the investment in digital compares to the cost saves.","We are not primarily motivated by cost saving with digital because I think that's about fourth on the list of things that the power that digital provides. Right now, it is still a net negative and probably for an extended period of time measured purely by cost, digital will probably be a net negative. But even then on the cost side, we're seeing benefits already in statement and payment processing, telephone servicing costs, workforce restructuring that you saw, branch efficiency, data storage, a lot of things. But the bigger benefits are things beyond that that show up in terms of better credit risk management, faster product development, and ultimately, the kind of growth that you're seeing.","So the reason that we took the time here to lay out efficiency ratio guidance was just to give you a sense of the commitment that we have to investing on the digital side and the commitment that we have to seizing the opportunity on the card growth side. And I think both of those factors are going to be significant enough that we don't see a lot of opportunity for the efficiency ratio to go down in the near term. All of \u2013 during the same time, we are working incredibly hard to save costs in one, minus those two areas, and I think today's announcement is a manifestation of some of those efforts.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And going back to Ryan's question a little more on the card loan growth that you're doing, a third of your business is below prime. How quickly is that growing relative to prime? Are you seeing a bit more migration into those segments as the economy improves?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Our mix is staying pretty steady. We're growing in all of the areas that we're investing in.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President-Global Finance","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Carcache with Nomura. And sir, please check your mute function. And Mr. Carcache, please check your mute function.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hello. Can you hear me?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Bill.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Can you talk about the IRRs on the new loans that you're originating today versus what those IRRs have looked like over the past several years? And within that, can you give us a sense for what's been happening with customer acquisition costs over time?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Bill, IRRs are probably on the higher end, but still in the range of the kind of IRRs we've seen going back for an extended number of years now on our originations. The primary thing is the magnitude of origination opportunity that we see. But it is also the case that the octane measured in terms of pretty much any way we measure it, but most importantly by, ultimately, the NPV, NPV per marketing dollar, IRR and various things is on the higher end.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President-Global Finance","Do you have a follow-up, Bill?","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","No, that's it. Thank you.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President-Global Finance","Next question, please.","Operator","Yes, the next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel.","Chris C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good evening, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess I want to ask two separate questions, I want to ask them together to make it easier. First, on the Card business, just such an impressive trajectory in your U.S. Card loan and volume growth, yet it's not seeing nearly the kind of follow-through that we kind of expected on the revenue side. I know you called out some of the payment protection plans as a negative, and I'm also looking at a pretty significant sequential decline in interchange revenue. And I didn't know if there was anything going on there, just there's a high rewards rate. And also sequentially, it went from like 12% to 6% interchange revenue growth as volumes are accelerating. So can you just talk maybe about that and any other factors that are weighing on U.S. Card growth?","And then my second question is for Rich on SMB lending. Just, I noted your comments about the Alt lenders and can't help, when I look at the small business version of some of these alternative lenders, that their business have changed a bit Capital One's core competencies and direct marketing and mining data and looking for mispriced loan opportunities. Can you talk at all your appetite for SMB loans that are nationally and directly originated? Thanks.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Chris. Yeah. Let me start with the interchange. The net interchange metric can have quite a bit of quarter-to-quarter variability because it includes partnership contractual payments, it includes international card. And we periodically adjust our rewards liability based on customer trends and redemption rates and things like that. So as such in any particular quarter, there tends to be a lot of noise around that. But if you sort of pull up beyond the quarterly noise, you're absolutely right in pointing out that net interchange growth has generally lagged general purpose credit card interchange growth. And \u2013 or purchase volume growth. And we would expect this trend to continue. In many ways, it's really a byproduct of the success that we're seeing. Our rewards programs have been and continue to be enjoying a lot of growth. We are making the choice to upgrade a lot of our customers to these products. And we're also extending reward products to existing customers who don't have rewards.","So if you look at the effect of all of those together, that's why interchange growth is \u2013 lags purchase volume growth. And I think that while that will bounce around for quarter-to-quarter, I think \u2013 and over the longer run, those two metrics will converge. I think it still will be some time before they fully converge. And with respect to the alternative lenders, for example, small business lenders, we're very intrigued with some of these startup companies. I think that they have demonstrated a lot of innovation that \u2013 from which I think we can learn a lot at Capital One. The way that they do their underwriting, obviously the digital capabilities that they have, in a number of cases, they're using very sophisticated and interesting data analytics. The way that they do cash flow-based underwriting, the way that they do the daily collections kind of thing, there's a lot of very creative activities going on in that particular space. We're watching it carefully. And we \u2013 and we'll continue to see and learn from the people that are leading in this space.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President-Global Finance","Next question, please.","Operator","Yes, the next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Rich, maybe first a question for you. You mentioned earlier in the call that on the card side, the card portfolio mix has been pretty steady. But if we take a look at some of your regulatory filings, it appears that the sub-660 FICO cohort within the U.S. card is growing at a slightly faster rate in terms of the overall proportion of loans with that FICO score.","So I guess I'm just curious, given that you haven't really changed your outlook for credit losses over the next few quarters, what do you need to see? What's the canary in the coal mine, particularly in the subprime side of things, that might make you reassess what your lost content in that particular part of the portfolio might be?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, Matt, you are right that while overall generally, the mix is about the same, there has been a very small increase in the subprime mix. But overall, when we look at our originations, when we look at the strategy that we have, there's a real consistency. And the phrase I say, sometimes the more things change, the more they stay the same in terms of how the opportunities we're pursuing and the nature of the growth that we're getting.","When you ask the question what is the canary in the coalmine with respect to this business, obviously we look incredibly carefully at the metrics that begin on the origination side. So we look at the nature of the mix of applicants that we get and that tends to be an indicator of whether there's positive or negative selection. And then we track very closely every single month all of the metrics and early indicators of whether there are any issues. And at Capital One we predict outcomes before, during and after every single origination.","So we monitor this incredibly closely. You also know that in things like the sub-prime space, we have about more than 15, approaching 20 years' experience in this particular space. So what I would say for it would be the same as I would say for any part of the Card business. We watch very carefully for adverse selection, we monitor the metrics extremely closely. And we stay mobilized to move and also to let our investors know when things change relative to our own expectations. But all that said, we continue to see really across the Card business a stability in the competitive environment, a stability in the origination environment, a stability in the consumer and their own behavior and really a stability in the vintages of our originations.","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","And clearly, if we saw a canary in a coalmine, I don't think you'd be seeing the type of growth that we're currently seeing in the Card business.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, if I can follow up with another credit-related question, I guess more on the commercial side and specifically with the oil portfolio, it looks like that was \u2013 your outstandings were down about 6% quarter-over-quarter from what you reported in the first quarter. Can you give us a sense as to, if the commitment trend is roughly similar in that portfolio quarter-over-quarter? And there's been some anecdotal evidence that there's been some increased focus from regulators on that portfolio. I guess I'm just curious as you head into the fall redetermination, sort of what your thinking is in terms of the potential for provision pressure within that portfolio.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, obviously, that business we're very, very closely monitoring and on numerous calls recently we have been talking about that segment. One of the benefits of the upstream oil & gas business is the ability to do the borrowing base redetermination. So loan balances were down 6% from the prior quarter as a result of the spring borrowing base redetermination and our E&P borrowers decreased their balances to conform to the lower commodity prices and oil field services companies reduced their balance sheets.","So we've pretty much seen across the energy business a pretty darn quick reaction by reducing expenses, particularly capital expenditures and taking advantage of the receptive capital markets. So all of that said, obviously you don't have to look very far to notice what's happening in oil prices and the volatility and risks there. So the allowance builds that we've had for several quarters now have been significantly driven by energy as well as in the taxi business as well, but that one we'll really have to monitor carefully. But we do like some of the inherent resilience dynamics that exist, particularly in the upstream part of the business as they move quickly to adapt to the oil pricing pressure.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President-Global Finance","Next question please.","Operator","Yes. The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe A. Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Just thinking about some of the comments you made about the revenue in the credit card business. Given that it seems like most of the incremental interchange revenue you're generating is going back to the consumer, could you talk about whether there's a increasing or decreasing percentage of the base that's actually revolving. And I've got a follow up.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Moshe, I don't have the metrics right in front of me, but I think there is a gradual migration away from a revolving towards the transacting side of the business, but I don't have a metric in front of me, nor do we report that. But just looking as you can see the pretty eye-popping growth in purchase volume, that would be consistent with that.","Moshe A. Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And you've made some comments kind of about the fee and finance charge reserve. I mean that probably three years ago was probably at least $100 million higher, so I'm assuming with the growth in the business that that's a number that probably could be rising over the next couple of quarters? Is that reasonable?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. All else equal more growth would lead to more of a reserve there.","Moshe A. Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President-Global Finance","Next question, please?","Operator","Yes, the next question comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I wanted to come back to something you said about the allowance methodology and qualitative factors. I'm just wondering with the environment we're in where we have like a 40-year low on jobless claims announced today and oil prices and gasoline prices remaining low, are those things you factor in to your outlook? Do you have expectations there? Because it seems like those should be tailwinds or have been tailwinds for credit quality, particularly for sub-prime borrowers for the last few months.","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Look I think the thing that you should really focus on in trying to forecast the primary drivers of provision are obviously charge-offs and allowances. We've given you a little bit of help on charge-offs over the near term. And the two things I really want you to spend your time on in terms of the allowance builds are really the loan growth expectations and the charge-off replacement phenomenon that I talked about. Qualitative factors can be important from time to time in terms of adjusting over the next 12 months, but I think if you focus on those two, that's going to be the most important factors.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President-Global Finance","Next question, please?","Operator","Yes, the next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Just a question on payment protection. You indicated 25 bps are going to be gone by 2Q 2016. I just wanted to make sure I understood that we should assume that that's a ratable decline over the next three quarters. And then, the follow-up is what kind of offsets should we be thinking about that could potentially come through?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Betsy, so this has been a gradually running off revenue stream ever since we stopped originating new payment protection in 2012. And that will continue to just gradually run off until the event happens over the course of the first quarter. It won't be on a single day. It'll happen over the course of the first quarter where we basically shut down the back book business. And so from a run rate point of view where you'll see that effect fully is starting with the second quarter. And what we're saying is relative to full-year 2015, this is a 25 basis point effect.","I wouldn't look for any specific thing to offset that. It's one of many, many things that affect revenue over time. Our point is other things being equal, that would take down the revenue margin by 25 basis points. So we have a very healthy revenue margin. We have great things going on in the business, but we are not intervening to do something on the revenue side to offset this. What we're doing is really just accelerating and getting over with something that was going to happen anyway over the next couple of years.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President-Global Finance","The next question please.","Operator","And the next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys, for taking my question. I'd like to just delve in a little bit to the 11% year-over-year Card growth. One of the things we're wondering is how much of that's really being driven by average balance growth from seasoned accounts, so say over 12 months, and how much is really driven by net new adds over the last 12 months?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As you can imagine, it's a very good question, Rick, because of course this is many vintages and various effects all happening on top of each other. I think the best way to think of this is that the majority of our originations and growth is from new account acquisitions. Just a general observation, the majority is coming from new account origination and the very natural early balance growth associated with that. And a sizeable minority is coming from credit line increases on more seasoned books, but we are approaching an equilibrium with respect to those effects. I flagged several quarters ago that we had a bit of an outsized credit line increase going on because we had had a brownout for the period preceding that. And we are pretty close to an equilibrium now, maybe just a little bit still of residual from on that credit line increase side. But what you see is approaching an equilibrium with respect to the mechanics of how growth works.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President-Global Finance","Next question, please.","Operator","And our final question today will come from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you for taking my questions. Rich, you talked about your incremental investments in digital and as I look at the banks and you guys, it seems like digital is clearly the Wild West to a certain extent. So when you think about digital investments, how do you think about sizing how much of a budget you want to allocate to those investments? And really how are you thinking about that in terms of investments over the next couple of years? I mean is there a specific earmarked amount or is it just ideas that trickle up that you feel that you can fund on a discretionary basis? It'd just be helpful to see how you're thinking about that. Thank you.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Sameer. Digital is becoming so all-encompassing into how life works and how the business works, it's increasingly difficult to even in a sense technically answer your question. But we don't start with a thing that says, okay, we have X million dollars to spend on digital and that is it. So what we do is we start strategically with the environment and say where is the world going and what does winning entail as the world goes there. And we work backwards and then develop a strategy and we figure out where we need to go as a company.","And along the way you can imagine that digital is a centerpiece of that entire strategic agenda. And so everybody from the bottom-up builds the economics of their business working backwards from where they're trying to go as a business, and all of that adds up to our overall economics. We see if it makes sense. We drive incredibly hard to wring out costs that are not directly related to digital innovation and growth. I know you can't necessarily see those effects, but they are very significant, as are the digital investments on the other side. But I'd just like to stop and reflect a little bit on what is it that we're investing in, because I think a lot of banks say, and I've heard several of them say it, we're going to sell funds as digital investment. And so you tell me how much you can save and that's how much we can invest. That is a really, really tough way to take any institution I think to where it needs to go because the marketplace isn't waiting for us to do that on those terms.","But on the other hand, we're not just investing in science experiments or seeing what's new and shiny object. When we talk about digital investment, it starts with talent. We're talking about bringing in top engineers, product managers, designers, data scientists often from tech companies and startups outside of financial services. And this is a very important thing and obviously it costs money to do that, but that's a foundational thing. We're talking about providing the digital workspaces and the most modern tools for these folks that's essential in terms of recruiting them and essential in terms of leveraging them.","So often I think banks when they think about digital, they think I've got to go build apps, we've got to get customer-facing or associate-facing apps. Most of the leverage is really in infrastructure in terms of things like rationalized and simplified core infrastructure, increasingly we're focusing on cloud computing and building the underlying capabilities such that product development will be faster and faster and more effective over time. We're obviously investing in terms of product development itself and we're on an accelerating basis shipping product and you can go to the App Store and take a look at some of this stuff. It's pretty highly rated. We're investing in cyber security. This is an incredibly important area and we are putting a lot of very top talent and a lot of energy and investment into that.","But the key thing is, this is not because we think this digital thing is cool and there's opportunities someday. These are delivering benefits right now on many fronts. While you can't necessarily see it in the numbers that you see, but the enhancements to productivity, the power of innovation, the dramatically growing customer experience benefits and it's inextricably linked to the growth that we are generating right now.","So pulling way up from that it doesn't really start with this is the number. It's really increasingly sort of who we are and how we think about the business. So pulling way up, what we are so focused on is making sure that we can generate very strong returns for our shareholders and continue to invest in a future that has very strong returns for our shareholders over time. And right now we see right in front of us two very, very big opportunities. One of them is card growth and the other one is this digital opportunity. Both of them involve spending money to make more money later, but at the end of the day, I go back to the thing that we focus on every single day. How can we create value for our shareholders today and ensure that we can create value for them tomorrow? And the way to do that is to generate well above hurdle-rate returns, to make sure that our investments are very disciplined and driven by a net present value framework to the absolute most rigorous extent possible, and be sure that we are really obsessive guardians of capital, and in the end, distributing capital to our shareholders.","So that's a long answer to your question, but I'm glad you asked because increasingly digital is who we are, and it's where the leverage is.","Sameer S.

Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norris","Thanks very much, Anne, and welcome, everyone, to Capital One's Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.","As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there.","In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our fourth quarter 2016 results.","With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Steve Crawford, Head of Finance and Corporate Development; and Mr. Scott Blackley, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Scott will walk you through the presentation.","To access a copy of the presentation and the press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, and then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements.

Scott?","Scott Blackley","Thanks Jeff.","Let me begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $791 million or a $1.45 per share in the fourth quarter. Pre-provision earnings were down from the third quarter as higher revenues were more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses driven by seasonal and growth related costs. Noninterest income in the quarter was negatively impacted by $42 million of accounting hedge and effectiveness driven by the magnitude and shape of the rate changes in the quarter.","Provision for credit losses increased as the smaller allowance build compared to the third quarter was more than offset by higher charge-offs. Notable items in the quarter included the following; a build in our U.K. payment protection insurance customer refund reserve of $44 million or $0.09 a share, an impairment charge associated with certain acquired intangibles and software assets of $28 million or $0.04 a share, and an allowance build in our auto business reflecting a change in accounting estimate of the timing of charge-offs of bankrupt borrowers of $62 million or $0.08 per share.","Turning to full-year 2016 results, Capital One earned $3.8 billion or $6.89 per share. Pre-provision earnings of $11.9 billion were up 15% year-over-year as higher revenues were partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net income for 2016 was down 7% as higher pre-provision earnings were more than offset by additional provision for credit losses.","Full-year efficiency ratio was 52.7% excluding adjusting items down from 54.3% in 2015. As you can see on Slide 4, reported net interest margin increased six basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.85% in line with the prior year increase and primarily driven by higher card yields.","Turning to Slide 5, as of the end of 2016 our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 10.1%, which reflects current phase in. On a standardized fully phased-in basis it was 9.9%. We reduced our net share account by 9 million shares in the quarter or 2%.","Full-year 2016 share count came down 9%. As you know we had an authorization to repurchase up to 2.5 billion of common stock. We've now completed 80% of our authorization at an average price of under $72 per share.","With that let me turn the call over to Rich. Rich?","Richard Fairbank","Thanks Scott. I'll begin tonight on Slide 8 of our Domestic Card business.","Loan growth and purchase volume growth remained strong. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year our ending loans grew $9.2 billion or about 10%. Average loans were up $8.9 billion or about 11%. Fourth quarter purchase volume increased about 10% from the prior year. We continue to like the return and resilience profile of the business we're booking.","Revenues for the quarter increased 9% from the prior year slightly lagging average loan growth. Even with the positive margin impacts of higher subprime mix, revenue margin declined year-over-year as expected with our exit of the back book of payment protection products at the end of the first quarter. Revenue margin for the fourth quarter was 16.8%.","Domestic Card purchase volume grew 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter net interchange revenue for the total company was flat versus the year ago quarter. As we discussed there's considerable quarterly volatility in the relationship between these two metrics. For the past several years on an annual basis net interchange growth has been well below Domestic Card purchase volume growth and we'd expect that to continue.","Noninterest expense increased just 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Our Domestic Card business continues to gain scale and improve efficiency. As we discussed for several quarters the dominant driver of year-over-year charge-off rate trends is growth math which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances in our front book season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio relative to the older and highly seasoned back book.","In the fourth quarter growth math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the prior year. Seasonality and growth math drove the increase in charge-off rate compared to the linked quarter. For the full year 2016 charge-off rate was 4.16% in line with our guidance. We continue to expect full-year 2017 charge-off rate to be in the mid-4 with quarterly variability.","Growth math remains the largest driver of expected trends in the 2017 charge-off rate. Growth math began to impact charge-off rates in 2015. In terms of contribution the year-over-year change in the charge-off rate, the peak impact of growth math was in 2016. We expect the impact to moderate in 2017 especially in the second half of the year. Beyond 2017, we expect growth math will have only a modest effect.","As an update on our Cabela's transaction, we do not expect to receive regulatory approval prior to October 3, 2017. This is the day when any of the parties involved in either the retailer deal or the bank deal can choose to terminate the transaction. Within the next week or so we expect to either withdraw our bank merger act application or have our application denied by the OCC. Ordinarily a bank would withdraw its application before receiving a denial but in this case our bank deal is tied up with the retailer deal which requires us to get consent from Cabela's in order to withdraw.","In either case whether we withdraw application or it is denied we will not be in a position to refile our application until after we have completed our work under the AML consent order. We remain committed to this deal and we will continue to work with Cabela's and Bass Pro toward completing the transaction.","Pulling up, we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business but the marketplace is moving. Competitive intensity across the card business remains high and revolving credit has been growing at about 7% year-over-year meaningfully faster than household income growth. As these trends continue, we believe the Domestic Card industry has moved into the more intense part of the competitive cycle. Now against this backdrop we continue to monitor the marketplace vigilantly and we continue to dynamically manage our origination and underwriting and anticipation. We believe the growth window of opportunity remains open but it's clear that this opportunity won't last forever.","Slide 9 summarizes fourth quarter results from our consumer banking business. Ending loans grew about 4% compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about 5% versus the prior-year.","Fourth quarter auto originations were $6.5 billion with strong growth in prime, near prime and subprime. Some of the aggressive competitor practices have moderated somewhat but we see opportunities for continuing growth the auto market and competitor practices remain dynamic and we will be very vigilant.","Similar to our Domestic Card growth, we like the earnings profile and resilience of the auto business that we're booking. Our underwriting assumption include a decline in used car prices. We continue to focus on resilient originations and we continue to expect a gradual decrease in margins and a gradual increase in charge-off as the cycle plays out. We also expect upward pressure on the auto charge-off rate as a result of the accounting treatment of bankrupt accounts that got discussed.","Consumer banking revenue for the quarter increased about 3% from the fourth quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans and higher deposit volumes was partially offset by margin compression in auto and planned runoff of mortgage balance. Noninterest expense for the quarter increased 5% compared to the prior-year quarter driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in retail deposit marketing.","For the full year we recognized about $160 million in branch optimization cost in line with our expectation. These costs show up in the other category rather than in the consumer banking segment. Fourth quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior-year primarily as a result of charge-offs in addition to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio. We expect that several factors will continue to negatively affect consumer banking financial results. In the home loan business planned mortgage runoff continues and in auto finance we expect that margins will continue to decrease modestly and net charge-off rate will rise.","Moving to Slide 10 I'll discuss our commercial banking business. Fourth quarter ending loan balances increased 6% year-over-year driven by growth in selected industry specialty. Average loans increased 16% year-over-year. Average loan growth resulted primarily from the acquisition of the GE healthcare business in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Revenue grew 18% from the fourth quarter of 2015 and noninterest expense was up 15% consistent with the growth in average loan. Provision for credit losses declined 52 million from the fourth quarter of last year as allowance release driven by the impact of higher oil and gas prices was partially offset by higher charge-offs. Fourth quarter charge-offs were primarily driven by continuing pressure in our taxi medallion portfolio. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 47 basis points.","Criticized and nonperforming loans rate were stable in the quarter. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.7% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 1.5%.","Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oil and gas and taxi medallion portfolio. We've provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves and other metrics for these portfolios on Slide 14 and 15.","I'll close tonight with some thoughts on fourth quarter result and our outlook as we head into 2017. We posted another quarter of strong growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes, as well as growth in auto and commercial loans driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue and related increases in operating expense and provision for credit loss. We've been working hard to improve the efficiency by growing revenues realizing analog cost savings and other efficiency gains as we become a more digital company and tightly managing costs across the enterprise. Our efforts are paying off. Our efficiency ratio for the full year 2016 was 52.7% net of adjusting items an improvement of 164 basis point from 2015.","We continue to expect that our near-term annual efficiency ratio excluding adjusting items will be in the 52s plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility. Over the longer term we continue to believe that we should be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains.","Pulling up our strong growth over the last two years puts us in a position to deliver solid EPS growth in 2017 assuming no substantial change in the broader credit and economic cycle. We expect that revenue will grow and will drive growth in pre-provision earnings as well. We expect the upward pressure from growth math on the allowance for loan losses will moderate and we're reducing share count. We continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive growth in return as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.","Now Scott, Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Rich, you mentioned the Domestic Credit market is in the intense part of the competitive cycle, I guess. When we think about how that impacts the growth trajectory looking out to 2017, should we expect the growth rate to moderate because of that?","Richard Fairbank","I think that it will contribute to a - I think this window is still open but as I've been saying kind of every consecutive quarter you know this thing won't stay open forever so I\u2019ll leave you with two points. One, we're still all-in in pursuing the window but I think that but let me comment for a bit just about the kind of natural physics that go along with the what's happening on the supply side.","First of all just to comment on the supply side. You know after a number of years post the great recession where the growth of revolving debt was near zero or even negative, it is crept up in the last couple of years and now it is running at a 7% year-over-year rate and obviously that's a faster growth rate than the economy is doing.","And if you look at this growth it is broad-based although subprime growth has picked up and is now growing faster than prime. So currently if you exclude Capital One's impact on the metric about 34% of the industry's growth is in subprime and subprime card loans are growing 13% year-over-year versus prime which is growing about 6% year-over-year. Now I really want to stress this is off \u2013 and particularly in the subprime side off of a - much lower base following the great recession, so let's just ground that a little bit.","We went back and looked at the data here, prime loans decreased 12% from prerecession levels and they began growing again in 2011. Subprime loans decreased 43% from prerecession levels and didn't start growing until 2014. So subprime industry outstandings right now are at 74% of prerecession levels and prime industry outstanding are basically right at prerecession levels.","So clearly the subprime growth is - happened later and its off of the lower bank but the growth has physics and that's what I know - I'm always focused on because when you have - consumers taking on debt and competitors you know supplying more debt that can affect both the volume and the selection quality of new origination, as well as of course you know impacting existing customers who along the way can take on more debt.","So what we do when we see that is we just - we try to manage Sanjay in anticipation of this because we view it as the physic and we are very - we've always said we can't predict the economic cycle but we really can watch and react to the credit cycle which isn\u2019t the same thing as the economic cycle.","So we are very focused on resilient, we try to anticipate how supply changes end up making their way into the credit performance of who we might originate and if I pull way up on all of that, we can continue to make very conservative assumptions in our underwriting, we managed to a belief that we are now in the intense part of the cycle but even with all that considered we still see a important growth opportunity available for us, is the window of opportunity and we will continue to pursue it obviously with our eyes very wide open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. My follow-up question is on the Cabela's portfolio. So when we think about that deal, can that deal be consummated without the bank merger occurring? So could you buy the portfolio without doing the bank deal? Or is that a non-starter for Cabela's? And I guess when we think about the partner you have in on that deal, are they willing to be patient and wait for you to sort out the AML stuff?","Richard Fairbank","If we are to buy this it requires a bank merger act application and approval. Now we and Cabela's all the parties in this transaction are working incredibly hard to make this happen and obviously with respect to our own AML order which is the thing at that needs to get to for the approval to happen here, we're all in working incredibly hard. We're working with Cabela's, we are very committed to this transaction and we believe this can be a great deal for us and for Cabela's Bass Pro.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll next move to Don Fandetti with Citi.","Don Fandetti","Yes, Scott. I just wanted to clarify, the $42 million hedge amount, I guess that's why the other segment had a negative, and in theory, I guess we add that to the adjusted revs of $6.593. Am I thinking about that right?","Scott Blackley","Yes, I think we experienced what I think a lot of other banks experience where the shape of the curve moved. That does go to other and it is a offset to noninterest income.","Don Fandetti","Got it. And then Rich, real quick on the 2016 Card vintage, Domestic Cards, was curious if you had any update on how that's trending?","Richard Fairbank","We still see '16 as coming in better than 2015 so our prior statement we feel viewing that the same way.","Operator","Next question comes from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.","David Ho","Hi. I just want to parse out the rate of increase in 2017, for the credit card charge-off rate, in the mid-4%s. You did mention that the growth math would slow. At what point do you think the credit normalization impact would slow, or do you?","Richard Fairbank","What are you defining as the credit? The credit normalization impact meaning growth math.","David Ho","No, just the natural re-levering of the consumer, some of the leverage impact you're seeing on the margin, just getting back from historically low levels, aside from growth math.","Richard Fairbank","Look what we have tried to describe to help our investors think about the credit card growth - the trajectory of credit card charge-offs is to divide it into two very different thing. One is what we call growth math which is the impact of - on the charge-off rate of the seasoning from a acceleration in origination. And the other is the general probably industry-wide affect that relate to the consumer, the amount of debt they're taking on and probably where things are in the economic cycle.","We said for some time now that the - that our numbers are going to be dominated by growth math and we are we're still saying that but I'm also saying that we should just all understand we are kind of at that part of the cycle where the industry I think is off the bottom with respect to the exceptionally low levels of charge-offs that we've seen from the very, very seasoned portfolios, all across the industry.","And so over the longer run our portfolio like all the card players is going to be - our performance is really going to be driven by this industry and affect but for now still the big story at Capital One is the seasoning of the - our front book and the math of how that plays out over - particularly over - as we played out in '16 and now in 2017.","David Ho","And in terms of the\u2026","Richard Fairbank","Sorry, go ahead David.","David Ho","Sorry. Just one more question. I was fascinated by - you bring up a very good point about leverage kind of rising above income. Do you think that that in isolation could create an environment where consumer credit, and that space, continues to exhibit some of the lost attributes that you just called out, in absence of any kind of shock to rates, gas prices, or employment?","Richard Fairbank","I think we have to take the holistic picture here. I mean I think it is the card business has been benefited by a number of years of having relatively low growth and particularly on the subprime side a big shrinkage and a delayed growth. So I think it's all has to be evaluated in the context of - from where it started and for how long it's been going in and where it's headed.","So our primary point has been - look in the end this is physics. The year after year just amazingly low losses it is - as we've said some quarters ago this has to be the bottom, things are going up from here all of that said you know I think that - I mean we are still - we are pursuing growth opportunities and continue to be optimistic about the originations that we can generate.,","So again we try to adjust based on an assumption that over time things will just gradually normalize. We try to get in front of that anticipate that, make our origination choices in the context of that and this view that we carry around internally, we just share that with our investors.","So I think we're still pretty bullish about the opportunity. But I've said probably a year ago, I said that when I cross-calibrate all the businesses especially the parts of commercial, the auto business and the card business that the card business was in the most benign and competitively benign part of the cycle and that auto and commercial were farther along in the competitive and credit intensity.","I would say the card business is certainly, I think caught up to the others - the others interestingly have had a little bit of almost a low if you will, and some stability there but all of the businesses in pulling way out banking in general is still moving along towards the more intense part of the credit cycle. But I think card has caught up.","Operator","Next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, Rich. Thanks. Following up on that last answer, how should we think about the things like marketing and rewards cost growth into 2017, given that commentary? Is there going to be any reduction there? And how do you think about Capital One's kind of role in that kind of competitive dynamic?","Richard Fairbank","I want to separate in a sense the intensity of competition around the heavy spender from the commentary I gave about lending. It's really in a sense two different business, the spending business and the lending business and both are competitive, both have become more competitive. But my commentary was really about the lending business because of the interaction between supply and ultimately the performance and things that make their way into consumers and credit performance and things over time and what I call kind of the physics of how cycles work.","The spender business is one that when I get concerned about supply and the intensity of competition, it's not a concern that is going to ripple into the credit performance. It's all a matter of the level of competition. How much it cost to get accounts, how we go out and market to get those accounts. What is the prevailing level of rewards that people are offering and in the end what choices should we be making.","So in the - so let me now comment about that business. That has also and it's - it will be a surprise to no one that say this, that has also become more competitively intense. You have seen some players on the cash back side kind of raise their offers up to a level higher than they were before and more consistent with some of the industry leaders there. You've seen probably the most intensity is come at the very top of the market going right after the very heavy spenders and that's a very priced customer segment. It's also very tough to prevail in that space, and that's very competitive.","So we have said all along this - this market, I can't remember the last time I said that this market is not that competitive. I think it is very, very competitive and it is particularly competitive at this moment. Now when we look at this we - and you made a comment about our role in this whole thing, I mean as there are a few players who I think have gone very heavy into the spender business and we are one of them and all of us are contributing to that competitive intensity.","But one thing I have found over the years and I believe so strongly about this business, this is a business that's about sustained commitments and building of a brand, building of a customer experience that is at the very high end a digital experience now that becomes very, very important in this thing, it's about the building a brand the marketing capabilities, and also product offer.","Now we - it is not our view to just go rush out and just keep changing product offers constantly. It is our view that we need a very good offer, which I think we have across our businesses and then the leverage is in really being great across the dimensions that I mentioned. All of that said we continue while the competition is intense, to continue to grow that business significantly, we continue to really like what is happening to our customers when we get them and their balances, their utilization, the percentage that are first and wallet and a lot of characteristics that are key to the success of the program.","So this is going to be competitive, I don't see a real course correction for Capital One here. I think that we are continuing to be one of the players that's going hard at this space and I think that we continue to see everything that we see is consistent where this is very value creating and generating of great long-term annuities. ","Moshe Orenbuch","Thanks. Just as a somewhat unrelated follow-up, on the Auto bankruptcy, Scott, did you say like what caused - what triggered this, and over what period of time it would have otherwise been reported?","Scott Blackley","Yes, Moshe thanks for the question. I'm just kind of run through a summary of what we're doing. So the bankruptcy change is accelerating charge-off timing for certain bankruptcy accounts. So starting in 2017 within 60 days of receiving the notification of bankruptcy, we're going to charge that loan down to collateral value regardless of payment status.","The net impact of that as you might be able to figure out is that we'll accelerate the charge-off timing and then we're subsequently going to have an increase in recoveries. So we would expect that over time, those things are basically going to start to offset each other.","The change here is really an accounting shift and doesn't reflect a change in what we're seeing in the business for our expectations, recoveries or cash flows. We are still working through some of the process changes to implement that. So there's a bit of uncertainty as to when the exact impact will show up in charge-offs. You'll see this in a few other process change we're making, they\u2019re going to start impacting the auto charge-offs really in the first half of 2017. You're going to see kind of a one-time larger impact as we process our current portfolio of BK loans. That will show up in the monthly metrics. We're going to put a marker on that so that you can see it.","And then in terms of why, really this is something where I think our past practice has been pretty much where others have been in the industry. We're moving to a more conservative practice. I think that's really consistent with how regulators prefer big banks like us to manage things.","Operator","Next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hi, good evening, guys. Rich, in the past you used the phrase uncoiling the spring. I'm not sure if you referenced solid EPS growth on the call. But, I was wondering, do you still feel confident that we could see an acceleration in EPS growth? Or do you feel that the competitive pressures that you've talked about, from either the window closening or too much supply coming to the market, are going to prevent us from inevitably seeing that?","Richard Fairbank","I feel great about our prospects for generating earnings power from the coiled spring of growth that really three years of growth in the card business, where we have gone all into seize the opportunity when we really like this opportunity and you have watched the, pretty breathtaking upfront costs of doing that particularly in terms of - on the credit side, both the front-loaded - the front-loaded nature of credit cost in what we originate but then of course that even being more front loaded by the allowance builds that precede that.","So that creates quite a coiled spring of earnings power and while it is true that the industry dynamics always are at play here, I think there is a lot of coiled earnings power here and while the precise levels of exactly how would, how it delivers itself always depends on industry things too. This is a pretty big effect and I do look forward to having the in a sense the potential energy that's been stored up in this spring to turn into the kinetic energy of earnings.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Maybe just one follow-up. Rich, you talked about all the progress that you made on efficiency this year, with over 160 basis points. When I think about the outlook today versus the last time we heard you speak, we've obviously seen the outlook for interest rates improve a lot, which I know historically was a headwind to efficiency gains in prior years. You talked about $160 million of Branch optimization costs, which I would assume likely won't repeat.","Can you just give us a sense of, what are the incremental investments that you're being forced to make that are preventing you from making further efficiency gains this year relative to what you did in 2016? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","So I don't feel we're being forced to make a lot of incremental investments. We are certainly continuing to invest important places we're investing is as we talk, many, many times is on the digital side and it's - as I've said for a long time the digital transformation of us really into operating like a technology company that's not a one or two or three years thing that is, that is the transformation that - that in many ways the lifetime transformation because the world will continue to change.","What I do want to say about that though is, while we continue to invest in that business. The very visible well, there are many benefits including growth and customer experience and ability to have an increasingly well controlled environment and compliance, the associated experience and all the stuff there are many benefits the meter, if you will of visible cost benefits that we're able to achieve directly as a result of the digital investments that meter is also growing too.","So we don't have any change to share with you in terms of our outlook in the near term relative to efficiency ratio. But what we see \u2013 benefit that one of which is on the cost side, I think it is going to be a good guy that's going to help us over the long-term continue to achieve increased efficiency in the company, even as we also go out and capitalize on the enormous benefits that come from this digital transformation.","Operator","Next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi good evening. Question just on the efficiency topic you were talking about. Expectation is that it remains around 52%, which what I hear in that is, that you're expecting the - that any expense build is going to be in line with revenues, or is it the other way around? I mean, with marketing in particular, do you anticipate maybe a near term continuation of an uplift driving revenues, and then feeding the revenue growth behind it to hit that 52%?","Richard Fairbank","Well first of all, I want to say the guidance is in the 52s plus or minus reasonable variant of uncertainty there. But so we do believe that we're continuing to capitalize on the growth window. I think our marketing investment is going to be still pretty significant when you look at the competitive levels on the one hand but also the opportunity on the other hand.","I think marketing investment is certainly going to be there and I have commented on some of the other investments. But I think when you pull up on all of it, which is a growth agenda and investment agenda and a whole bunch of savings that are also happening in the mix master, it nets out to an expectation of efficiency ratio in the 52s over the near term.","Betsy Graseck","And then on the provision side, you talked about Domestic Card 4.5%-ish, in that range. Is that -- we get typical seasonality throughout the year, I would expect. But is there anything else that would drive how that NCO is likely to traject throughout the year besides just seasonality?","Richard Fairbank","Yes. So if you - so the two things - so seasonality we would expect to be the typical seasonality effect. We have talked about growth math on an annual basis that growth math being the upward, the upward pressure on charge-offs that comes from the seasoning of this front book of substantial originations. So, we've described, its biggest effect is in 2016 it still has an important effect in '17 and then it becomes pretty modest after that, that speaking one year at a time.","If you look within a year it tends to move okay. That it's a bigger effect in the first part of this year then it is in the latter part of the year, just not as a seasonal thing, but consistent with the fact that this is gradually diminishing as an effect. So that, so that in addition to seasonality I think it's useful to put a little slope on the growth math effect over the course of the year.","Scott Blackley","One thing - Betsy this is Scott, one thing I do want to clarify our guidance is that losses in 2017, are going to be in the mid-4s. I think you put out a point estimate we've intentionally used mid-4s. ","Operator","Next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of small follow-ups on Auto. Rich, you mentioned that the competitive environment there is improving a little bit, and I think you made similar commentary last quarter. If we can just understand in what form you're seeing that, is that on pricing or on rate? Or, how is that manifesting itself?","Richard Fairbank","Okay. First of all, we should use a small letters not capital letters, with respect to this effect. It is - and we made a pretty big deal - we spoke with some alarm really about a year ago and you may remember it was in the year ago quarter that our originations I think our subprime originations dropped and then it dropped pretty materially at that time because we were alarmed about the underwriting practices that we started to see in the marketplace but not by most players but on a more isolated but important basis, we saw in one or two cases and it one or two competitors.","That was more of a subprime phenomenon. It related to the amount of documentation and data that was going to be required to underwrite a loan and willingness to do it on a more low doc basis, which we didn't want to go there. That has not disappeared. That has mitigated if you will, so that we see the effect, but it is not as rampant as it was a year.","So that is improving with a small eye if you will. Okay, but certainly don't - and then the other, the other thing that's going on I think in the prime part of the marketplace which has been very competitive in many ways, probably a little bit more competitive than cycle average, if you look at some of the effects on the margin side.","I think there might be just a tiny bit of easing maybe about related to and I'm speculating here with respect to maybe certain capital requirements for players and the attractiveness of prime auto relative to that, this is again a relatively small effect, but certainly I would say the kind of steady - in steadily increasing pressure on the - competitively on the prime side has lightened up a little bit, but it's not, it's not a big effect but it was enough that we who especially when we talk about the auto business, we take what the market will give us and we don't take anything more than it will give us and buy and in the context of that, we've just found that this year it's got a little bit more to give us.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. Thanks for that. And just on the - backing out the bankruptcy effect from this change in recognition, is there any change in your underlying you view on credit evolution?","Richard Fairbank","No, so if you separate that effect, we have said even obviously that the bankruptcy accounting effect that raises the expected number for next year. If you take that effect out, we do still expect that our charge-offs will be higher next year than this year. This is actually just a continuation of the kind of normalizing effect it's been going on for a number of years.","And as we've mentioned over the years, we have seen and probably over the last few years, just a - each year successive vintage coming in just a little bit higher in terms of credit losses than the year before all very much consistent with very good business and all of that and is again the natural physics of kind of how the marketplace works.","And the other thing on Capital One's loss rate is that we have for years our prime percentage in our portfolio has been going up and so that has - that's been an offsetting factor in the loss rate but as we've said over a number of years, there is still this gradual normalization that's going on and we still feel very good about the opportunity in the business.","Scott Blackley ","I just want to pile on, I mentioned this earlier, but I just want to reiterate that the change that we made in accounting really was not associated with new or different view about recoveries or how we look at that and really was just moving to a more conservative process in that business.","Operator","Next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel.","Chris Brendler","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. On the net interchange growth of just 1%, I understand that it can be volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I just want to make sure I'm clear here, that roughly 9% growth for the year, is that a good run rate? And can you just help us figure out or explain what drives that quarter-to-quarter volatility? I think in the past it may have been expansion of rewards programs or tweaking rewards programs. Just given the level of investor concern about rewards costs these days, any comment there would be he helpful.","Richard Fairbank","Okay. So first of all - and we've always said the quarterly this thing balances all over the place and this is - you can't draw a lot. So I want to talk a little bit about the volatility and then let's talk about sort of the bigger picture though trends that are going on.","So quarterly it can fluctuate because an individual quarters we update our rewards liability based on points earned and redeem, redemption mix, redemption rates. It includes partnership contractual payments, international card, consumer bank net interchange. And so, there are lot of things that go into the quarterly number.","What we have said is this phenomenon of interchange - net interchange growth being well below purchase volume growth, I think is something that while individual quarters can bounce around that is a real effect that's been going on for the last couple of years and we would expect it to continue.","We're building a long-term franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers, we're extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards very importantly of course we're originating a lot of new business with strong flagship products like Quicksilver Venture, our spot products for small business that have very attractive rewards.","So our continued investment in the business and continuing to build a franchise that affect will continue. The other thing that has gone on \u2013 on a rolling basis over the course of this the past four, three or four quarters is what's happened with respect to a few a small number of merchant deals where interchange was renegotiated downward and that there is two ways that plays into our portfolio. One is when the interchange rate drops, obviously we feel that effect but there is kind of a lasting effect too because the handful of merchants where this interchange became lower are also growing faster than the economy.","And so their growth will over time continue to roll through our numbers, so pulling way up, we continue to be very bullish about the opportunity to grow our spender business, all of our calculations are with our eyes wide open about the fact that net interchange growth is going to lag the pretty eye-popping growth.","We've been able to get in the - on the reward side of the business, but when we incorporate the full economics of our spenders and we have years and years of experience with this and lots of tests and rollouts and many, many things that the integrated economics for Capital One given the franchise that we have built, I think continues to be very attractive even in the context where there is will be a delta between purchase volume growth and net interchange growth at least in the in the foreseeable future.","Chris Brendler","That's helpful. Thank you. And then, a follow-up on a related basis. The U.K. business has seen some interchange reductions. I assume that's filtering through there. But I'm surprised International Card was not broken out separately in the release. Any signaling there? And also, I'm also surprised that the weaker pound isn't having a more dramatic effect on the outstandings in that segment, just because it would seem like the underlying growth, actually, is a little stronger, just given how much the pound has been hit.","Scott Blackley","Hi Chris, this is Scott. Yes, so on the international given that component of our total card businesses just gotten continued to be smaller and smaller, we no longer felt like it was important to material for us to break that out separately. So going forward, you'll see us having total card and Domestic Card. We're not going to separately break out Canada or the U.K. so you'll see that kind of working its way through our monthly metrics and the rest of our financial reporting starting with our 10-K. ","Operator","Next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Rich, I wanted to follow up on your comments around subprime growth in Card. In looking through the public filings, it doesn't seem like the larger players are increasing their sub-660 FICO exposure. So, I wondered whether you were perhaps seeing smaller players growing in subprime? Can you comment on where the supply is coming from?","Richard Fairbank","It is coming from all of the above. It is definitely coming in some of the larger players. And I can't speak to their back books, what I can speak to is the good solid data we have on what is happening in the origination marketplace and there has been. And the data that I gave you, that is excludes Capital One therefore, by definition is the industry, but, and I think you've actually seen a player to comment on, stepping up a little bit here and I don't want to overdose with the point. ","This is off relatively small base. And it is in the context of some other players also growing probably across the board, all the way from the top of the market but there is a tail that is extending into the - below 660 marketplace that is real and these are real customers picking up more debt and we also validate this too when we look - we can follow the industry's trends with our own customers by looking at the credit - while beyond, looking at our own customers and what are their balances we look on collectively all of their credit bureau reports and see what's happening there.","And we see that same phenomenon that is in the industry data, it would be shocking if we didn't. But we can see some increase and these are relatively small effects but some increase in indebtedness for example in our own customer base.","Bill Carcache","Understood. That's very helpful. Thank you. Separately, if I could throw in a question about capital. If we were to stick with standardized, how much room is they for your CET1 ratio to fall below, call it the 10% range? Obviously, some regionals are running below that, but they don't have as much exposure in Cards. I was hoping you could share with us a little bit about how you're thinking about that.","Scott Blackley","Yes, I don't want to front run the process on capital, I think we understand the importance of capital return, I think we've been very creative in our process, whether it was - I think the first to use the de minimis exception last year front-loading, stock repurchases this year at attractive valuations. I think one of the things we're actually most pleased about is the fact that we've been able to put a lot of capital to work organically and acquisitions, which I know this is a market that particularly in the financial services industry, good growth has been hard to come by. ","So, I\u2019ll end where were Rich ends, where Rich ended his prepared comments with the profitability that we have we believe we can both continue to fund growth and return a good amount of capital to our investors and we think we can do that even though there is still a fair amount of uncertainty in the environment with respect to the regulatory front. How CCAR is going to change, what's going to happen to Basel IV, Cecil, some of the other long-term factors that are going to drive the way we allocate capital.","Operator","Next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matt Burnell","Thanks for taking my question. Scott, maybe just a quick one for you. In terms of the bankruptcy change, just want to make sure that what you're - what I think you're saying is, that the reserves that you took in this quarter are basically the entire effect that you think you'll see in terms of the provision that will be needed for the Auto portfolio. Then going forward, it's just - it's effectively business as usual in that business, other than the bankruptcy effect on the loss rate itself. Correct?","Scott Blackley","Now you've got that right and just to kind of repeat that to make sure we've got that clear. So the allowance build reflected kind of the change that we saw in accelerating losses into the allowance window. So I think that's going to cover the vast majority of the effect. And so I mentioned, we'll start to see recoveries come in overtime and offset that increase. So, you will see a bubble in '17 and then you'll see that start to settle down.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And then for my follow-up, just a question on the revenue margin. Obviously, that came down about 30 basis points this year, year-versus-year because of the U.K. portfolio. How are you thinking about that margin going forward? Is there going to be the same effect on revenue margin in the card business from the U.K. portfolio in 2017, as we saw in 2016?","Scott Blackley","I'm sorry, just to clarify, are you talking about the year-over-year decline in the Domestic Card revenue margin?","Matt Burnell","Yes.","Scott Blackley","So the Domestic Card revenue margin won't be affected by U.K.'s PPI.","Matt Burnell","Okay. My mistake. But, is your outlook for that going to be basically flat? Or is it going to continue to come down because of the competitive pressures?","Scott Blackley","Matt, we have really gotten into forecasting revenue margin by line of business. I think what we've done is kind of pulled up and look at the things that are driving margin for the company overall and general rates going to be a positive assuming forwards play out the way that they have that hasn't happened in the past, but I think there is more feeling that rates could actually mature the way that the forwards are expected.","I mean if you look we've gotten benefits from a higher mix of card and a lower mix of mortgage. So I'll let you know make your own forecast there in terms of mix probably being a beneficiary. There have been some, as Rich mentioned these were throughout his comments there's also been a little bit of rate pressure on auto and normalization there.","So it's kind of - the story hasn't really changed over the last couple of years. We've gone out and made big predictions about potential changes in revenue margin and ultimately they been pretty flat. So that's made us a little bit less bold. I think you have all of the factors that you have to think about the major things are going to drive net interest margin for the company.","Operator","Next question comes from Ken Bruce with Bank of America.","Ken Bruce","Thanks. Good evening. Appreciate all your comments in trying to tease out some of the moving pieces here. I guess, in the context of transactors, in particular, you kind of point out that the economics of that business are still very attractive. I think many of us are concerned that they look attractive to everybody, and so that there's going to continue to be this pressure on the rewards and the various incentives used to kind of acquire those cards. Is there a way to frame, in your mind, kind of how that annuity looks today versus maybe five years prior to now? Does it take you 30% longer to effectively have a positive NPV out of those cards? Can you give us some sense as to how it's -- kind of the timeliness of the economics on that business?","Richard Fairbank","Ken I think this annuity - look I want to go back to - this has been incredibly intensely competitive for a long time. We see that there is a flurry right now with respect to a few products, some breathtaking giveaways in terms of - for a period of time up front miles and things like that but the - first of all I just seen anything ebb-and-flow over time a lot.","The second thing I would say is in many ways our own - when we look at these annuities in many ways they are improving every year for Capital One because of the investments that we're making to really build the business I want to go back to the part that I think you all see - the world sees so much is what is being offered in terms of rewards and obviously that has become more competitive.","But the - for the last several years we've been offering pretty much the same rewards products and so you know we've already internalizing those economic. The reason I say this is an all in business that it doesn't work to just bounce in and bounce out is what incredibly important is things like the - how long these annuities last, what is the attrition rate, what is the first in wallet rate, what is the mix, the profile of how heavy your spenders are when you're getting them, what is happening to customer metrics on customer satisfaction, net promoter scores, the digital experience, and we have had nothing but progress year-after-year on this and our own annuities are actually getting better and better and actually more economically attractive.","It\u2019s not to say I don't worry a lot about competition and focus on that and we talk about it all the time but this is about franchises and people can't will themselves in the franchises overnight is taken us a number of years to build it and I have a lot of respect for the competitors who are going after this space and there's some great players that are doing this but this is attractive business for those who have built a franchise and I'm as excited today about it as I was three months ago, six months ago and one year ago.","Ken Bruce","Understood. I think I get a sense of that. Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Looking at the subprime growth in the portfolio, it's been roughly over two times kind of the prime growth on the revolver side, U.S. Card business. And, I can hear the caution that you're kind of trying to lead us to in terms of kind of where we are in the cycle. I appreciate that. Does, in your mind, that need to slow in order to kind of achieve some of the -- kind of the lower growth math impacts that you're talking about for 2017 and 2018?","Richard Fairbank","Ken you known me for many, many years. We obsess in the best of times. We obsess about everything credit because in the worst of times is too late to be obsessing about everything credit. So I remember one of our leading investor called me Dr. Doom in the 90s because I kept focusing on that even though we're in such an amazing kind of boom time.","My point is these are all effects that play out over a course of years. My real point has been that just people need to watch all the metrics as I\u2019ve been saying for a lot of quarters and we really believe there is power that you can manage - to say something I said earlier it's hard to predict economic cycles but there's a lot of leverage in managing within the credit cycle. And so I give you a calibration of where we see the marketplace is, it means that we add probably even an extra layer of caution in our own originations and in our choices to the earlier question does that impact growth. I mean in some sense all other things being equal it slows down growth a bit but with all of that going on a lot of - we've been talking about this and anticipating this interactions for a long period of time.","So I still go back if I pull way up in this business we're very happy we see the growth window when it is been there. It is still there the competition is heating up, we're still going after it. We continue to build a coiled spring of earnings power that - there's a lot of upfront cost now but a lot of earnings power that is being compressed in this spring.","All of this is in the context of an industry marketplace that is moved off the bottom, it's only got one way to go and over time it is just physics but we can't predict exactly how these will play out but I think that the - the earnings power and the growth math that are associated with how that plays out is a real phenomenon and I think has a lot of value creation baked into that. And we continue to be bullish about the business and about our prospects to deliver some nice numbers for our investors.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

[Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time, now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norris","Thanks very much, Linette. Welcome, everybody, to Capital One's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.","As usual, we're webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we have included a presentation that summarizes our third quarter 2012 results.","With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Gary Perlin, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Gary will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and the press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements.","For more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factor section in our annual and quarterly reports, accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Perlin. Gary?","Gary L. Perlin","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Third quarter earnings were $1.18 billion or $2.01 per common share. The third quarter was the first one which reflects a full 3 months of both ING Direct and the HSBC U.S. Card business, along with Capital One's underlying business performance. While the absolute level of merger-related accounting impacts was considerably less this quarter as compared with the first 2 quarters of 2012, linked quarter comparisons are obviously affected significantly. Looking ahead, there will be some ongoing impact on revenue and operating expense from merger-related accounting, although quarter-to-quarter movements should be far less exaggerated. In contrast, the impact of merger-related accounting on credit metrics has now largely run its course.","After I briefly review a few key items from the third quarter, Rich will speak both to our underlying business performance and what our results this quarter suggest about future trends. I'll discuss our summary income statement on Slide 4.","The significant increase in earnings this quarter versus the previous quarter can largely be explained by 3 factors; continued strong performance in our businesses, a full quarter of HSBC operations and a large reduction in acquisition-related credit accounting impacts compared to the previous quarter. Linked quarter pre-provision earnings increased about $800 million, driven largely by moving from a partial quarter to a full-quarter impact of acquired HSBC credit card operations. There was also a substantial reduction in charges related to legal and regulatory matters and in other unique items, which affected second quarter results.","Compared to the second quarter, the additional months worth of revenue and expense related to the HSBC Card business increased pre-provision earnings this quarter by approximately $175 million, which is net of about $100 million of acquisition-related accounting effects. After building the finance charge and fee reserve by $173 million in Q2 to cover expected non-principal losses on the acquired revolving loan portfolio of HSBC, there was only a $17 million negative effect on revenue in Q3. Revenue continued to be negatively affected in the quarter by $133 million in premium amortization related to both acquisitions. We expect that this impact will decline about 15% per quarter.","Operating expense declined modestly in the quarter due to a steep reduction in charges related to legal and regulatory matters and other unique items. While we had an extra month of HSBC-related operational expenses and PCCR amortization compared to the second quarter, this was partially offset by a reduction in merger-related expenses. Amortization of purchase accounting adjustments for intangibles and other assets was about $170 million in the quarter and is expected to decline at about 5% per quarter going forward. The majority of this amortization represents PCCR and CDI, but the total also includes amortization of software and other assets. You can find details on acquisition-related accounting and other items in the financial tables, those that are appended to our earnings press release, and you'll also continue to see detailed breakouts in our quarterly financial reports.","Finally, lower provision expense was driven by a significantly lower allowance build related to acquired HSBC credit card loans, offset to a small degree by higher linked quarter charge-offs due to lower absorption of losses by the SOP 03-3 purchase accounting mark. To be specific in this quarter, the mark on impaired loans we acquired from HSBC absorbed approximately $176 million and now stands at $149 million.","Net charge-offs also include a one-time charge of about $25 million from the implementation of newly issued OCC guidance regarding the treatment of consumer loans where the borrower has gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy.","Turning to Slide 5. Let's touch briefly on net interest margin. In the quarter, reported NIM was up 93 basis points to 6.97%. The increase in NIM on a linked quarter basis was the result of 2 factors: First, the full-quarter impact of acquired HSBC Card loans and associated reductions in cash and cash equivalents; and second, the benefit of a much lower build in the finance charge and fee reserve related to those acquired HSBC Card loans. As the impact of the acquisitions on this metric have largely played through, we expect significantly less variability in NIM going forward. Quarterly changes from here will depend on the evolution of our asset mix in and among our businesses, ongoing pricing dynamics in the loan and deposit markets and on the general level of interest rates.","Before turning the call over to Rich, let me quickly cover off on capital on Slide 6, followed by our initial thoughts on the longer-term impact of Basel III.","On Slide 6, you'll see that as of September 30, our Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel I basis was 10.7%. Following the HSBC Card acquisition in the second quarter, we've seen strong capital generation driven by earnings and a corresponding reduction in disallowed deferred tax assets. These favorable movements were partially offset by a nominal increase in risk-weighted assets as acquired mortgage loans continue to amortize and are replaced largely by Commercial and Auto loans that carry a higher risk weighting. With the bulk of acquisition-related accounting impacts now behind us, strong and more stable earnings along with some portfolio shrinkage due to the run-off of acquired loans, we expect to see continued steady capital generation going forward.","Turning to Slide 7. And before discussing our Basel III capital destination, it's important that I remind you that starting January 1, 2013, we will formally begin our journey to adopting the advanced approaches required under Basel II for banks exceeding a $250 billion asset threshold. Of course, we have already begun the long and intensive process of building our Basel II models, but it's worth noting that this is a massively complex undertaking and that we will not formally enter the period of calculating capital metrics under the advanced approaches in parallel with standardized approaches until January 2015, nor could we exit that parallel process until at least January 2016. I'm emphasizing this point because we expect to be the only bank not currently running parallel that when Basel III is fully implemented would likely be required to use the Basel II Advanced Approaches.","So while estimates using the advanced approaches are essential for calculating our Basel III ratios, we are early in the process especially when compared to all other Basel II banks who had been calculating these ratios in parallel to Basel I for a number of years. Thus, while it's important to all our stakeholders to have a sense of what Basel II means for Capital One as we enter the Basel III world, it's also worth recognizing that we will be refining our models and business judgments for years to come. The recent notice of proposed rule-making regarding the implementation of Basel III and Dodd-Frank capital rules modifies those capital rules under both Basel I or standardized approaches and Basel II or advanced approaches. Assuming that these rules were in effect today and that the Basel II Advanced Approaches were the more binding of our Basel III capital ratios, we estimate that Capital One would have a Tier 1 common ratio in the high 7% range as of the end of the third quarter, which includes the effect of 2 adjustments that incorporate changes in our balance sheet that will occur without any explicit management actions. These are the amortization of PCCR and the expected pay-down of capital punitive investment security positions such as non-agency mortgage-backed securities.","All told, we are currently assuming an 8% Tier 1 common ratio target under Basel III. This target assumes a SIFI buffer of 50 basis points and an additional buffer of 50 basis points. Our final long-term target will depend on ongoing regulatory expectations and business judgments. And for many reasons, it's subject to change.","Looking through all this complexity, we expect to exceed that 8% Tier 1 common level on a fully phased-in Basel II and Basel III basis in 2013. Based on our current capital strength, our capacity to generate healthy amounts of capital going forward and the expected timing implications of implementing Basel II and Basel III, we continue to believe that returning capital to shareholders will be an increasingly important part of how we deliver shareholder value.","With that, let me turn it over to Rich to discuss our underlying business performance. Rich?","Richard D. Fairbank","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 8, which provides an overview of solid business results in the quarter. Our Domestic Card business continues to deliver strong results. Excluding the expected run-off of higher-margin, higher-loss HSBC loans and the continuing run-off of installment loans, domestic revolving credit card loans grew modestly in the quarter, in line with expected seasonal patterns. Excluding HSBC, purchase volumes grew about 9% compared to the third quarter of last year. Revenue margin was unusually strong at 17.1%. I'll discuss the reasons for the elevated third quarter revenue margin and where we see revenue margin going over the next several quarters in just a moment.","The charge-off rate was unusually low. For the last couple of quarters, our credit card metrics have been dominated by the addition of HSBC's Card portfolio. HSBC ran at a higher loss rate than Capital One's Card business, but the addition of the HSBC portfolio temporarily improved our combined credit metrics because we took a credit mark on HSBC's severely delinquent loans. The credit mark absorbed the bulk of the charge-offs from the HSBC portfolio in the second and third quarters.","Beginning in September, most of the HSBC charge-offs are happening outside of the credit mark, so we expect Domestic Card charge-off rate to increase significantly in the fourth quarter as the impact of the market has largely run its course and because the third quarter is the seasonal low point for the underlying card charge-off rate. Our Domestic Card business remains well positioned to deliver strong and resilient profitability and strengthen its valuable customer franchise.","The Consumer Banking business posted another strong quarter. Ending loans declined about $900 million, in line with our expectations. $1.2 billion of continuing growth in Auto loans was more than offset by about $2 billion of expected mortgage run-off. Average loans declined by a more modest $392 million. Revenues increased from the second quarter driven by the valuation of retained interest in mortgage securitizations and growth in average Auto loans. Excluding the valuation impact, revenues were stable quarter-over-quarter.","Provision expense was up with seasonally higher charge-offs and allowance build in our Auto Finance business. Our Consumer Banking business continues to gain traction with national scale Auto lending, local scale banking in attractive markets and growing national reach with the addition of the ING Direct franchise. Our Commercial Banking business continues to deliver strong and steady overall performance. Loans grew 3% in the quarter and 14% year-over-year. Revenues were up 2% in the quarter as loan yields declined modestly. And credit performance continues to improve. We expect the strong and steady performance of our Commercial Banking business to continue.","We've said previously that we expected our post-acquisition run rates to emerge in the second half of 2013 after several quarters of significant noise from merger-related items, partial quarter impacts and new baselines for nearly every key income statement line item. Although the most significant merger-related effects are behind us, third quarter results can't yet be viewed as a run rate because of a few remaining merger-related items, which Gary discussed. And taking any single quarter as a run rate requires adjustments for seasonal patterns in loan volumes, credit and revenue margin, particularly in our Domestic Card business.","It's not lost on us that investors and analysts are, of course, hard at work, making adjustments to quarterly results in search of our new run rates. Tonight, I hope to provide some additional clarity for our investors by pointing out where the run rates are emerging and where they aren't and where emerging run rates may not be indicative of future trends.","I'll discuss several key balance sheet and income statement trends beginning with loan volumes. Our outlook for loan volumes is summarized on Slide 9. The biggest story for loan volumes is the significant run-off we expect over the next couple of years. In our first quarter earnings call, we expressed -- expected run-off in terms of the next 12 months. Well this evening, we're shifting to a simpler view of annual run-off in ending loans balances expected in 2013. We expect that more than $9 billion in low-margin mortgage loans will run off. Mortgage run-off has accelerated slightly in the low interest rate environment. We expect about $2 billion of run-off in Domestic Card, mostly from higher-margin, higher-loss HSBC Card loans. In total, that's more than $11 billion or 5.5% of Capital One's total loans.","In contrast, we expect solid growth in businesses where we're investing to grow. We continue to gain traction in the parts of the Domestic Card business that we're investing in. Our Auto Finance business continues to grow loan balances, and the steady growth and success of our Commercial Banking business also continues. However, there are some risks to our underlying growth outlook. We continue to see weak consumer demand for the foreseeable future. Competition is picking up in several businesses, particularly Auto and C&I lending, and our base case assumption is for no meaningful change in the current, uncertain and challenging economic, regulatory and interest rate environment.","To be clear, I've been speaking in terms of ending loan volumes, but it's important to internalize the growing divergence between Capital One's trends in ending loans versus average loans. We've learned from our experience with the Kohl's partnership that private-label retail cards have a more pronounced seasonal pattern in loan volumes as compared to general-purpose credit cards. We've seen a sharper ramp-up at the end of the calendar year, coupled with a sharper decline in the first quarter of the calendar year. Now that we have a larger partnership business, we expect that the seasonal pattern will be more pronounced in our broader Domestic Card business and, to some extent, at the overall corporate level as well. Because average balances drive revenues, this is an important distinction.","In Domestic Card, we expect full year 2013 average loans will decline modestly from the third quarter levels. We expect that run-off of higher-margin, higher-loss HSBC loans will outpace modest growth elsewhere in Domestic Card. Outside of the run-off portfolio, we remain focused on franchising, enhancing rewards customers that build balances slowly over time but create and sustain significant long-term value through very low credit losses, high spend and very long and loyal customer relationships. We're also focusing on the partnerships business where the HSBC U.S. Card business acquisition catapulted us into a leading scale position in the private-label partnership space. And we continue to target portions of the revolver market that deliver strong and resilient returns through the cycle. Our choice to stay on the sidelines in significant portions of the most balance-intensely prime revolver segments limit balance growth opportunities even as other card metrics show stronger growth.","Beyond the Domestic Card business, we expect full year 2013 average loans to decline modestly from third quarter levels as growth in Auto Finance and Commercial average loan balances won't fully offset the significant expected run-off in mortgage loan volumes. As a result, it's likely that our investment portfolio will grow modestly. All told, we expect full year 2013 average loans for the total company to decline modestly from third quarter levels. But excluding the significant expected run-off, our focus on growing franchise, enhancing customer relationships in our Domestic Card, Auto Finance and Commercial Banking continues to drive strong underlying loan growth and the opportunity to gain share in these businesses in which we're investing.","I'll discuss margins beginning with Domestic Card revenue margin on Slide 10. Reported revenue margin of 17.1% includes about 60 basis points of negative impacts from purchase accounting. Third quarter revenue margin also benefits from seasonal trends as the third quarter is the seasonal high point for Domestic Card revenue margin as compared to average annual levels. This is because the third quarter is the seasonally best quarter for charge-offs, which drives fewer revenue reversals. At the same time, delinquencies rise seasonally in the third quarter, which drives higher pass-through fees and the third quarter has a higher day count, which drives higher finance charge and interchange revenues. By definition, seasonal patterns are not sustainable throughout the year. Adjusting for the offsetting impacts of purchase accounting and seasonality, the adjusted third quarter revenue margin was about 17.3%.","We expect Domestic Card adjusted revenue margin to decline from its current level. Slide 11 shows expected quarterly revenue margin reduction from third quarter levels for factors we can estimate because they are largely driven by our own decisions. Franchise enhancing moves include items we've discussed in the past, such as aligning HSBC's customer practices with our own and the ongoing impact of our decision to stop selling products like Payment Protection. By the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect these moves will result in a 50 basis point reduction from the third quarter of 2012 revenue margin, as shown on the chart. And in 2014, the run-off of another year of Payment Protection products is expected to reduce revenue margin by another 10 basis points versus 2013.","We also expect the run-off of higher-margin, higher-loss HSBC loans will change the mix of loans in our Domestic Card business, driving another 15 basis points of reduction from the third quarter revenue margin by the fourth quarter of 2013. As always, other factors, which are much harder to quantify and predict, will also affect revenue margin. These factors, which include market and pricing dynamics, credit trends and competitive intensity, could have positive or negative impact on the revenue margin.","Slide 12 summarizes emerging trends for non-interest expense. We expect that third quarter operating expenses are a good approximation of the average quarterly operating expense in 2013. We expect 2013 quarterly expenses will remain similar to third quarter levels for each component of overall operating expense, including purchase accounting, integration expense, run rate synergies and the remaining underlying operating expense levels.","As Gary discussed, we expect the operating expense impact of purchase accounting to diminish somewhat, but to remain similar to third quarter levels throughout 2013. We expect average quarterly integration costs in 2013 to rise modestly, but to remain similar to third quarter 2012 levels. To date, we've recognized about $210 million in integration costs for the ING Direct and HSBC U.S. Card acquisitions. We expect to incur most of the remaining $420 million in integration costs by the second -- excuse me, by the end of 2013. In addition to integration costs, we've already recognized deal and transaction costs of about $100 million in 2011 and 2012. We don't expect to incur any further transaction costs. HSBC U.S. Card business acquisition catapulted us to a leading scale position in the private-label partnership space.","Both integrations remain on track, and we've already realized the significant portion of expected cost synergies for the combined deals. Of the $90 million in announced ING Direct cost synergies, we've already achieved annual run rate synergies of about $80 million from reduced FDIC premiums and overhead reductions. Of the $350 million in announced HSBC cost synergies, we've already achieved annual run rate synergies of about $270 million. Most of the expected HSBC synergies were realized when we completed the acquisition on May 1 because we didn't bring over all of the overhead from HSBC USA.","Third quarter operating expenses already reflect the ING Direct and HSBC synergies that we've realized. On a combined basis, we expect to fully achieve the annual run rate of $440 million in announced synergies in 2013. Third quarter 2012 operating expense already reflects our ongoing investments in infrastructure and customer franchise. We ramped up our investments in these strategically critical efforts through 2011 and have reached relatively stable levels of ongoing investment. We're investing across the company in scalable infrastructure and operating platforms that are appropriate for a bank of our size and business mix. We're investing to ensure we stay ahead of rising regulatory and compliance requirements faced by all banks, and we're investing to deliver a brand-defining customer experience that builds and sustains a valuable long-term customer franchise. We expect that 2013 average quarterly operating expenses related to infrastructure and customer franchise will be similar to the third quarter of 2012. Third quarter operating expense also reflects continuing investments in growth as we hire Commercial bankers and Auto sales teams to help drive the strong growth in these businesses. Because we expect continuing growth in these businesses in 2013, we expect that operating expense investments will continue at levels similar to the third quarter of 2012.","Turning to marketing expenses. We expect the fourth quarter marketing expense will increase significantly driven by the timing of year-end campaigns and promotions. For the full year 2013, we expect marketing expense to be about $1.5 billion.","I'll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 13. Capital One delivered strong results in the third quarter of 2012. While loan volumes remain challenged and interest rates remain low, each of our businesses continues to post solid revenues and returns. In our Card and Auto businesses, credit is stable at historically strong levels with normal seasonal patterns. Credit in our Commercial business continues to improve. ING Direct and the HSBC U.S. Card business are making strong contributions to our business results as we expected. With integrations of both deals well underway, we continue to believe that both transactions are financially and strategically compelling.","Because the ING Direct and HSBC U.S. Card acquisitions are such key sources of shareholder value, we're committing all the necessary management time and talent to executing sure-footed and effective integrations. We expect to deliver solid performance in a challenging environment in 2013. The combination of Capital One, ING Direct and the HSBC U.S. Card business puts us in a strong position to sustain underlying growth, strong returns and capital generation even in an environment with low industry growth and prolonged low interest rates.","We do not manage the growth targets at Capital One. Instead, we take a highly disciplined and rigorous approach that focuses on maximizing NPVs and long-term value creation. But our heritage in building Capital One over the last 20 years has been rooted in strong organic growth. Even in the low demand, low growth environment today, we're delivering strong underlying growth in the businesses and segments we're investing to grow. The upticks of underlying growth are muted by the significant run-off of portfolios we've largely inherited in the acquisitions.","In 2013, we expect run-off of 5.5% of total company loans, but we expect to get most of that back through continued growth in businesses with strong and resilient risk-adjusted returns, including Auto Finance, Commercial Banking and key parts of Domestic Card. The ability to deliver high returns and strong capital generation is a particularly important source of shareholder value in a low growth, low interest rate environment. We like our positioning to deliver that value. The mix of businesses we've chosen, our advantage positions in national lending, our great local scale commercial banking and deposit franchises in attractive markets and our national banking reach with ING Direct all position us to deliver and sustain profitability and returns at the higher end of banks. As a result, we're generating capital at a rapid pace.","Our Tier 1 common equity ratio improved by 80 basis points in the third quarter of 2012. Our capital position is strong today, and we expect to continue our very strong capital generation trajectory in 2013. As Gary discussed, we expect to reach our assumed Basel II, Basel III targets in 2013 well ahead of requirements. Deploying capital in the interest of our shareholders will be an increasingly important part of how we create shareholder value. We're committed to delivering that value, including distributing capital to shareholders through meaningful dividends and opportunistic share buybacks, consistent with our long-standing commitment to maintaining a strong and resilient capital base.","Now Gary and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations staff will be available after the call. Linette, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take your first question from Chris Brendler with Stifel.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just one question on the capital front. As you deal with the phase-in period, how does that impact your near-term plans for capital return to shareholders? How do you think about the balance between these rules going into effect in several years and how the regulators think about that as you look to the next couple years? And then the second question would just be, if there's any more color on the Auto Finance business, pretty significant slowdown in the originations this quarter. I know you've been talking about it. Just give us a little more competitive flavor of what's going on in Auto.","Gary L. Perlin","Hey, Chris, it's Gary. Why don't I start out with your question on the capital rules, how they get phased in and how that affects our thinking about the potential for capital distribution. I think, at least, the phase-in approach is pretty clear. It's very clear that the next CCAR process will continue to ask for a stress test that's done exclusively on a Basel I basis. We did very well on that stress test last year. Our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I has improved. And I do believe that we're obviously well positioned therefore to show continued resilience to stress. The requirement under Basel III, as you know, is more of a requirement that one show trajectory to be able to comfortably get to the necessary capital levels under Basel III during the timeframe that's been made available. And obviously now, there is kind of 2 steps or 3 steps with respect to Basel III. As Rich and I have said, we expect that we will be at our Basel III destination with an assumption about how Basel II will affect us already in the middle of 2013. And so, as a result of that, we believe that we'll be able to very comfortably check both boxes. And obviously, as time goes on, we move a little closer to operating under Basel III, we expect we'll continue to generate capital that will improve that ratio. And obviously, as we become more deeply involved in the Basel II world, we'll obviously be looking at our businesses as many other Basel II banks to try and optimize to get the greatest amount of capital efficiency. I think, all told, we're going on multiple pads but all with the same destination and all pretty much with the same timeframe in mind. Why don't I hand it back to Rich on the Auto business.","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, Chris. We continue to have very strong growth in the Auto business, but our originations are down off the extremely high levels that we had, say, in the second quarter. So for example, they're down 9%. In the third quarter, they're still at very high levels and are 15% higher than the third quarter of 2011. So let me just describe what's going on. First of all, there continues to be -- although we're getting to the later stages of it, we -- the strategic growth trajectory we have in Capital One by the geographical expansion and taking the business strategy that's already been proven and taking it into more geographies and more dealers, so that's a very sure-footed thing. We are -- at some point, over the next couple of years, we'll start to reach the full penetration relative to that. On the other hand, we are also are responding, Chris, to the competitive marketplace. There is more intensity in the Auto business. And we watch closely the margins. We look at the margins and LTVs and FICO and terms. And like I said earlier, we don't set growth targets, we very much respond to the marketplace that's there. Overall, I would say it's still a healthy business. I think some of -- the pricing has -- in the prime space, has fallen to pre-recession levels. In subprime, it's relatively healthy, but it is falling somewhat. The -- from an underwriting point of view, the thing that's been loosened up is terms where terms are actually beyond where they were in the boom. In other words, we're talking about the length of the loans themselves. But LTVs have stayed; in fact, have been tightening since 2009. People got very burned with those. Average FICOs are still at strong levels, slightly degrading from an industry point of view. But my overall comment would be we still feel very good about the business. I think there is more competition, which takes a bit off the -- some of the extremely high growth that we've had in the past.","Operator","We'll move to Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Gary, is it fair to conclude that you still expect to return capital in 2013 at a level that's above 2012 capital return?","Gary L. Perlin","Betsy, just as I've said over the course of the last several quarters, including at your conference, I think we're going to be in a strong position to make that case to the Fed, which gave you a pretty strong description of where we feel we're going to be able to deliver shareholder value and we indicated that would include a meaningful dividend. We don't think we're there yet. So I think, directionally, I think that's what we're working towards. But obviously, we have to go through the entire process until we get there.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then can we just talk a little bit about what a good run rate is for expenses. The slide decks said that most of the deal synergies are baked in. So I wanted to see if $3 billion was a good run rate going forward or if there is any other tweaks you'd want us to be aware of?","Gary L. Perlin","Let me try my hand at that for you, Betsy. And again, I can't, on mix, the paint of all of the costs that came from the different parts and pieces of what are now Capital One. But let me try and do the math a little bit for you. So at the beginning of this year, we talked about a run rate of about $2 billion or around there, maybe a little bit higher for Capital One Legacy, taking into account all of the investments that are necessary to meet all of the rising bar of regulatory expectations and our own infrastructure needs. So that would get you to about $8 billion on an annual run rate. HSBC and ING Direct, if you look at the performance we've provided, they brought over with them expenses at a rate of about $2 billion a year for HSBC and about $650 million a year for ING Direct. So I'm giving you the annual rates there. So $8 billion legacy, add about $2,650,000,000 for the acquired operations. Next year, remember, purchase accounting is still significant even if it's not moving around a whole lot, it will be there, somewhere in the $550 million to $600 million range. And as Rich said, we have a couple hundred million of integration spend likely to go. If you add all of those up, you'd get to about $11.6 billion synergies. As Rich described, of about $450 million, takes you to about $11.1 billion, $11.2 billion that seems like a reasonable level for 2013. And again, you also have to remember, I'm just talking here about operating expense, not the marketing expense. Rich indicated $1.5 billion is a good estimate for 2013. So if you put all that together, you'd be just over $3 billion of a run rate for total noninterest expense next year. Again, all of it depends on things like marketing opportunities and so forth. But if you are at about $12.5 billion for total NIE next year, more or less, that's a way to add all of this together. And then obviously, once the integration spend passes, we're going to continue to do what we've been doing all along, which is look for efficiencies in our business at the same time that we don't sacrifice the quality of the integrations and the importance of maintaining our infrastructure at the highest possible level.","Operator","Rich Shane from JPMorgan has your next question.","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When we look at the information you guys provided today and there's a lot of really helpful information, the revenue or the margin build or cascade that you show us is particularly helpful. Can you just sort of relate that to what you expected when you acquired HSBC? Is this a little bit better, worse, or in line with the original acquisition assumptions?","Richard D. Fairbank","It is consistent basically with that. The -- you may remember that we talked about 30 to 35 basis points of actions that we wanted to take to bring HSBC in line with Capital One practices. We had targeted that to happen over the first half. It's actually -- some of that is happening on a little bit of a delayed basis. So -- but this table -- so first of all, the HSBC thing is very consistent with what we expected all along. And so what we've done is tried to take the composite actions that we're taking sort of on a customer point of view and put them together. And in doing it quarterly, please understand that my prior example of the HSBC timing is probably going to slide slightly. We wanted to just make sure that people got the general sense of the magnitude of what we're talking about and the general timing of that and this is consistent with deal assumptions. Of course, there is also legacy Capital One elements within those numbers as well.","Richard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. And then just to clarify something. Gary, in your response to Chris Brendler's question, it sounded like you indicated that you felt that you would reach the B III 8% ratio, Tier 1 ratio by midyear 2013. That's wasn't necessarily indicated in the slides and I think it's a pretty important distinction. Is that -- am I hearing that correctly?","Gary L. Perlin","Look, I think it's going to be in 2013. I can't pinpoint it for you, Rick, but I think let's think back to what Chris' question was all about, which was how does this affect our thinking about capital distribution and our approach to CCAR and so forth. That ratio does not need to be reached for several years. What we need to show is that we are on a strong trajectory to reach it. I think, whenever in 2013, we reach that would be consistent with being on a strong trajectory to reach it. So I wouldn't worry too much about exactly what moment it happens. I think the impact on our thinking would be the same.","Operator","Moving on to Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I was hoping to get a little bit more on the revenue margin trajectory. So when we consider its trajectory for the fourth quarter and 2013, should we start at that 17.26% adjusted or like 16.6%, which is the reported number less the seasonality, because that accounting impact stays for 2013, right?","Gary L. Perlin","It shrinks over -- so just to be clear, that purchase accounting impact will be running off over the course of the year, that's a result of premium amortization that goes into the debt interest income in the card business. So that's going to be coming down over the course of 2013, and it's about 15% a quarter, it comes down. So that's the purchase accounting impact. Again, remember, the fourth quarter is also a pretty high quarter for revenue margin tends to drop pretty considerably in the first. So you're going to have the combination of the rundown of the negative effect of the purchase accounting, offset, to some degree, by the seasonality, which again, is strongest in a positive way in the third quarter and then, the other actions that we're talking about which Rich described.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the September charge-off rates. Is it fair to say that, that September charge-off rate of like 3.93%, that didn't have any impact from the mark?","Richard D. Fairbank","It had a modest impact on the mark. I mean, the -- over the next number of months, the impact of the mark is going to be kind of high-single-digit-kind of basis points. So it's gotten pretty darn small. And September was the first time that, that was the case. Of course, we have all the seasonality effects, as you know, Sanjay, on that. But pretty much, we're now down to single-digit impact from the mark. Can I go back, just talk for a second, about the revenue margin trajectory, Sanjay? So we mixed a couple of things in trying to create some clarity. Let me explain this to you. We -- in creating this adjusted number, we, in a sense, took out the seasonality in the third quarter number. And then we provided some quarterly effects that are known. But I do want to say, of course, the other quarterly effect is the seasonality itself. And just to give you a little bit of insight on that the -- by the effect, in fact, we told you for the third quarter, the revenue margin relative to the average is the biggest in the third quarter. It's modestly above average in the fourth quarter but pretty close to average. Its lowest period is the first quarter and then it's slightly below leverage in the second quarter. So it's -- the Card business, the revenue margin, just is a byproduct of a lot of the other seasonal effects that go on. But given that we're now really trying to take run rates and understand them, we wanted you -- we wanted to do the best we could to tease out that very large effect in the third quarter. But I'd just add this other just general directional indication of the seasonality in the revenue margin.","Operator","That will come from Moshe Orenbuch from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Actually, I was going to ask also about from a credit loss perspective, when you think about that, you've got -- it sounded like from the prior question that you've got a modest amount remaining of the HSBC losses to come back in. As you kind of think about that movement from August to September, the core portfolio, was that relatively stable? I mean, it looked like there was something of an increase in the Master Trust, so should we be thinking about there being some kind of underlying increase on top of that? And maybe kind of if you could also just discuss how to think about the provision relative to charge-offs into fourth quarter and 2013?","Gary L. Perlin","Moshe, the -- so in the third quarter, Domestic Card losses increased 18 basis points. The increase was entirely driven by the purchase accounting impacts. Without these losses, it would've improved by 33 basis points. And legacy, just to give you a little more insight, legacy Domestic Card -- the legacy Domestic Card book decreased 43 basis points in the quarter and this was even better than the normal seasonal improvement we'd expect between the second quarter and the third quarter. And without purchase accounting, HSBC portfolio losses decreased from $5.64 billion to $5.08 billion, modestly better than seasonal expectations.","Richard D. Fairbank","Moshe, your question was specifically about the monthly move from August to September in the Master Trust. It was up slightly, which I think, we would view in line with normal seasonal patterns from August to September just for the single month.","Gary L. Perlin","And as far as your question on overall provision, Moshe, its Gary. What...","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, it certainly is in relation to the credit card portfolio.","Gary L. Perlin","Yes, sure. And look, I think, we've certainly had some movements in the coverage ratio because of the impact of the mark. I would say just as the impact of the mark is kind of reached its end, we're getting to a coverage ratio that from here on out is basically going to reflect just our overall view about credit. It should not be significantly impacted by the mark going forward.","Operator","That will come from Jason Arnold from RBC Capital.","Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Rich, just curious if you can talk about the competitive activity in the card space. And then you mentioned also C&I competition. If you could comment on that as well, please?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, Jason. Let me start with the Card business. So first of all, just sort of the demand environment out there. As I'm sure you know, revolving credit has sort of finally sort of gotten back to 0% growth in the last number of months. But industry revolving balances are down over 18% from prerecession highs. And so that's sort of the -- and the flattishness -- the overall flattishness of revolving balances very much feels like the marketplace that we're operating in and we don't have an expectation of any material, I mean, nothing to indicate that it would significantly deviate from that. So let me talk about what's happening on the supply side. Direct mail volumes are down significantly and pretty strikingly this year, frankly. And I think there is some net reduction in supply implied by that but not as much as the -- and I can't -- it's something like down 40%, I mean, depending on where you -- but it's down a fair amount. But some of the marketing has moved to alternative channels, of course. And the day will come when direct mail is more of a distant memory in terms of how marketing used to happen. But I still believe that net, Jason, overall supply is down a bit this year versus last year. But I don't think this is necessarily great news in the sense, maybe opportunities really growing based on that because I think the reduction in supply appears to be sort of an equilibrium as competitors react to what they found out last year in the marketplace. And we saw several competitors kind of do some blitzing last year and are sort of pulling back now. So I think we've more reached sort of a stable equilibrium on the supply side and probably fairly stable on the demand side. Pricing, and by pricing, I'm really talking about go-to pricing here, that's been stable over the past year. And in the segments we compete, we feel that those margins are strong enough to create good, solid, resilient returns. There are important parts of the prime revolver space that we think don't have a high enough go-to rate to really cover the resilience that we would need as we stress our portfolio. I also want to say that you can see teaser lengths creeping up and that's particularly a product in the revolver space, especially in prime revolver. Teaser lengths have crept up by an average of 3 or 4 months over the past year and some competitors are now up to 18 month 0% teasers, which further impacts margins. The competitors are very intensely going after the rewards market. I mean, this is not much change really in this. It's been this competitive pretty much all the way through the Great Recession. People went right at the top of the market and they intensely went after that. But we continue to feel confident in our ability to compete there. We like the results that we're getting from our own transactor cards. So it's certainly a competitive space. So overall, I think, the Card business is settling out in an equilibrium and that would be my description. It's an equilibrium and we can work with that. But the -- as I mentioned, I think competition is heating up in Auto and it's heating up somewhat in the commercial area. So let me turn to the second part of your question. The -- well, first of all, I'll comment on demand for just a second. I think what we feel is demand for credit and commercial has abated a bit since last quarter. And loan demand now is more focused on refinancing existing credit at lower rates and longer tenures or financings that enable tax management in advance of the fiscal cliff here. We're seeing less demand for working capital lines and I think there's a reluctance to expand in the face of uncertain political and economic environment. So that's a modest effect relative to the past but I just wanted to point that out. Now competitively, we do see a difference between C&I and commercial real estate. I've said for years that when you think about the limited number of places that banks can generate assets and all their traumatic experiences in some of the ones -- some of the places they have been, C&I is kind of the go-to place in banks. We have -- we expect that this thing will overheat at some point. Now what I say is you can feel competition intensifying in this landscape. We're seeing some pressure on terms and spreads, covenant light deals are beginning to show up in this indicated market. But this is a yellow flag. We're not throwing a red flag here but in a cross calibration of our opportunities, we do see more heating up in this space than some of our other areas. In commercial real estate, interestingly, we see less structure and price pressure in that market. They're an abundance of stabilized properties that need refinancing and there are fewer lenders that have returned to these markets and those that are active seem to be showing quite a bit of discipline in structures and in pricing. So all in all, kind of pulling way up. If you think about where we are in the cycle, this is a pretty good part of the cycle coming out of the Great Recession, things have stabilized and I think that -- one thing I've always said is while we'd love to see a robust economy, I think we are positioned to succeed and with the choices we're making, even if the economy, in fact, kind of doesn't go anywhere at this point.","Operator","We'll move next to David Hochstim from Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just to clarify, the $9 billion reduction in Home Loans that you've talked about, does that include any securities? And if not, what's going to happen to the securities balances? And related to that is what's the yield on those loans that you expect to run-off?","Gary L. Perlin","David, it's Gary. It's going to be kind of a mixed bag because as Rich said, the largest book of loans that's running off is mortgage loans, which of course has the lowest margin of any of our loan products. But there is some amount of card product, including some of the higher loss, higher-margin business out of HSBC, although it's a small number, it packs kind of a lot of wallop when it comes to margin. But it's being replaced, to a large extent, not fully, by Auto and Commercial, which tend to have yields that are more akin, if you put them together, to the average kind of yield on the overall book. And if you think about it, if where we have to put some of our deposit funds, because of the runoff of the mortgage business is in the investment portfolio, the investment portfolio margins are not materially different from mortgage. So I don't necessarily believe that you'll see a dramatic change in overall margins as a result of the decline in loans that Rich described. But again, we'll have to see exactly where the replacement comes from. We'll have to see what we can do to help out the margins on the deposit side and so forth. But you've seen a lot of movement in our NIM over the course of the last year that was driven by the deals. The deal impact is pretty well through. From here on out, hard to predict. But I certainly wouldn't expect anything close to the kind of variability we have seen. But we're going to have to work hard to keep where it's at and we'll see how it works.","Operator","Moving on to Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions and I want to make sure I'm understanding this kind of guidance correctly. First of all, in terms of the charge-offs, you said this quarter, $176 million was absorbed by the reserve. So if we take $176 million and add $877 million and then subtract $25 million for the OCC impact that takes me about up to $1,050,000,000. Is that -- am I thinking about the underlying charge-off number in the right way?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, I mean, obviously, you are, Chris, but remember where we are in terms of seasonality and where the overall trend may be going. But your math for Q3 is absolutely on track.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then secondly, in terms of -- I just wanted to take your guidance, put it in my words and see if you agree with it, which is that basically, if we're looking at 2013, that basically, the ongoing purchase accounting benefits should more or less offset the underlying -- the spending on further integration expenses.","Gary L. Perlin","Yes. We're in the right ballpark there, Chris, that's true.","Operator","Moving next to Don Fandetti from Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just talk a little bit more about the operating expenses. You kind of went through some details. Looking back to Q4, they came in a little higher than I think what people were looking for. Is it -- do you believe that they're sort of trending or your guidance for '13 is sort of where you were thinking? It seems like maybe they're a little bit higher than what was expected?","Gary L. Perlin","No. I mean, unfortunately, remember that conversation pretty well, Don, we had a lot of -- talk about it and what we said and again, we have a little bit of variability quarter-to-quarter in operating expense as well. But I think what we said was that if we applied all of the investments that were required to get ourselves up to the kind of level of infrastructure and the level of rigor in terms of being able to meet the regulatory bar with our compliance and everything else, we've said it would be between $2 billion and $2,050,000,000 on a quarterly basis. I still think that's absolutely the same kind of level of intensity that we have now. I'm not suggesting that we won't have further needs. But hopefully, we'll be able to finance those by consolidating the gains that we've had until now. So I'd say it's about the same. Unfortunately, I can't go back and figure out what legacy Capital One would be today because that doesn't exist anymore. But when you add all the pieces together, it's kind of where we would have expected to be. Now unfortunately, the revenues are not necessarily racing ahead. Remember that most of the revenues that we might have expected at the time of deal announcement that we no longer see in 2013 are simply the mirror image of -- starting off with a much better capital position. So instead of discount accretion, we've got a lot of premium amortization. We're going to end up in the same place in terms of capital but we had more of the capital upfront or less capital consumption upfront, and we're not going to rebuild it with the revenues. So all else being equal, I'd love to say that we could dramatically change our cost trajectory in the short run to kind of meet that need. But I think Rich was pretty explicit about where those operating expenses are going. They're going towards integration where we're seeing the synergies, and we're really focused on getting that right. It's going into infrastructure which is both to satisfy the rising bar of compliance, as well as to try and make sure that we're providing really good experience for our customers. And then we've got some of the expenses coming from the tail end of purchase accounting. So I do feel good about our ability to kind of simplify and streamline our business once we complete the integrations. And so I still think we've got some leverage to gain from the operating side. Unfortunately, in the year that's ahead, we can't really back off on what we need to accomplish and we're just going to have to make sure everybody understands that if revenues aren't there because of purchase accounting, it's in the capital, may not be in the income statement, it will be the balance sheet. I think we feel good about where we're headed for 2013. But the work in terms of getting simpler and more efficient will continue beyond that.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just real quickly, I know you talked a lot about capital, but as I look at -- has your enthusiasm about a capital return changed from, let's say, last quarter? And would you still hope to look at both dividend payout and opportunistic share repurchases, like you've talked about in the past? I just want to clarify that.","Richard D. Fairbank","Don, I wouldn't say our enthusiasm has changed because we've been very enthusiastic. I really want to say that we -- it kind of relates to my point why I think Capital One can be a very successful company even if the economy goes nowhere fast. I mean, we have been and expect to continue to be a very capital-generative company. And we'll continue to invest in organic growth opportunities and I think the strong earnings power is going to well outstrip those opportunities. We've also been working very hard on the, in many ways, mind-blowingly complex Basel II calculations that to try to get an estimate of what the impact of that is going to be and we were able to show you that today. But all along, we have very much known the way value is going to get created in this company is we're going to -- my image about our company is we are going to be a company that should be on the higher end of returns, earnings power of companies, because we have chosen a mix of businesses that tend to, I think, be better on what they can offer in terms of returns and we tend to be at the high end of the players in that business. So -- and underneath it all, I think there's inherent growth trajectory that will certainly manifest itself as these run-off portfolios go down. But in the meantime, earnings power and capital generation is going to be a key way that value gets created. We were as enthusiastic about it last quarter as we are now. And with every passing quarter, we get more capital and more clarity on what the rules of the game are and that puts us in a position to distribute more of it.","Operator","That will come from Scott Valentin from FBR.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just with regard to the private label performance, you mentioned there's more volatility around balances and seasonality. I'm just curious if you've seen anything else regarding the difference in performance between private label versus general-purpose card?","Gary L. Perlin","Yes. The private label business in -- our private label business, now if you look at all the private label businesses out there, this wouldn't necessarily apply to all the ones out there in the marketplace. But ours, meaning what we have built and what we've gotten in terms of HSBC, tend to be characterized by lower returns, somewhat lower returns but well above hurdle, lower credit losses and that's interesting because you'll look elsewhere out in the marketplace and you actually see much higher credit losses often in this. But overall, while in some ways, bringing partnerships on lowers the per unit octane of this earnings machine we have in the Card business, it is incrementally real value creation. We really like it, and the other thing about it, I think, competitively, it is a very scale-driven business and there are 3 players in the private label business that really have that scale. And if you look at the lead tables, it pretty much falls off after that. And this is the scale to have to be able to invest in the customized things that clients need. It's the scale to have the operating cost in what is a bit of a thinner-margin business. And it's the -- it is the -- it gives us an ability to have the credibility with partners to say we've been there, done that and talked to our previous clients kind of thing. So a little bit lower octane but real value-added. And right now, HSBC's partnership business has been shrinking a little bit. We have moved away from a few of the smaller partners. So there's a bit of a kind of shrinkage going on here but we're going to invest more in this business and I think you're going to like the returns.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. So just to -- you started answering my second question. But additional partnership opportunities I guess you guys are now out there looking for those opportunities and I guess you mentioned those 3 scale players. I mean, how competitive is it to get new partnerships?","Richard D. Fairbank","Well, the partnership business, we didn't just wake up and discover partnerships when HSBC showed up. I mean, we have watched this business for a long time. And I do want to say, in the last decade, in the decade leading up to the Great Recession, these things started to go for auction prices that were at the nosebleed kind of level. So we selectively involved ourselves in some of these things. But again, we -- to me, this is all about selectivity. And right now, the supply and demand, if you will, of players in that business, is much more sensible. But we know it also can be great over time. Here's the key. We're not setting out to be the biggest. The key word for partnerships is selective, picking a good retailer, in other words, a company who, in its own right, is the kind of the business we'd like to invest in as an investor so to speak. Secondly, a partner with the right motivation where they want to drive their partnership business to generate -- to enhance their franchise as opposed to a way to make just more bucks. And retailers are on both sides of that very key dividing line. And finally, a contract that really works as a win-win for both parties. We have -- so we are both out there in the marketplace selectively looking for new opportunities and we're also reviewing all of our existing partnerships and with a -- each one, we're going to make sure that, that partnership, when the contracts come up for renewal and all of them come up from between now and 2019, as they come up for renewal, we're going to ensure that we have the right relationship and the right structure of contract in place. We have renewed several of the big contracts already and we have -- those negotiations have been very important to establish, that we have it in the right way but -- so we'll continue to be very selective. But in that way, I think, we can create a lot of value and not go off the rails as some people have who have been chasing this business.","Operator","Your last question will come from Craig Maurer from CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just one quick question on your discussion around capital. When these deals were originally announced, you were pretty clear that you didn't think that you would have any SIFI penalty involving your capital levels. So I was wondering what's changed considering you discussed the 50 basis point SIFI buffer.","Gary L. Perlin","Craig, it's Gary. I don't remember giving guidance on SIFI buffers way back when and it is for good reason that we gave you an assumed target with an assumed SIFI buffer. I think, if you take a look at banks of our scale, you'll see that they're making reasonably similar assumptions, and so we wanted to make those assumptions absolutely transparent to you. You can make adjustments, if you will, if that required buffer is higher, obviously, we've already suggested that we would have some additional buffers. And again, I think, we will be well in excess or certainly on a trajectory to get well in excess of those levels. So we'll see where it goes. But at this point, I think we're making some pretty realistic assumptions.","Richard D. Fairbank","Okay.

Steve?","Steve Crawford","Thanks, Jeff. Let me begin with slide 3 tonight. Capital One earned $1.15 billion or $1.96 per share in the first quarter. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.12 billion or $1.91 per share and had a return on average tangible common equity of 16.8%. As you know, our capital plan was approved in the quarter and our Board has authorized $2.5 billion in share repurchases over the next four quarters. Included in continuing operations results this quarter were a lower provision for loan losses driven by lower charge-offs and a $208 million allowance release and $27 million in discrete tax items, primarily related to changes in New York State tax law.","Our historical financial statements have been revised, as we adopted a new accounting standard for investments in low income housing tax credits in the quarter, resulting in the cost of investing in qualified affordable housing projects no longer being recognized above the line in operating expense or rather below the line as a component of tax expense.","In addition, the new accounting standard results in higher costs in the earlier years of the investment [flows] due to faster amortization, resulting in a modest reduction in historical earnings and a one-time $112 million reduction to retained earnings. We have provided an appendix slide that outlines the impact of the consolidated company and the segment results due to the adoption of the accounting rule.","Excluding the impact above, operating expenses decline quarter over quarter, largely due to the absence of non-recurring restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter. Additionally, linked-quarter revenues were lower, driven largely by day count and lower seasonal volumes in cards.","Turning to slide 4, let me briefly touch on net interest margin. Reported NIM decreased 11 basis points in the first quarter to 6.62%, more than entirely driven from the first quarter having fewer days worth of recognized income.","Average interest-earning assets were down modestly quarter-over-quarter driven by lower average investment securities and cash offset by higher average loan balances. Average loans were higher on a linked-quarter basis due to continued growth in our auto, finance and commercial businesses offset by declines in card balances primarily due to seasonality. Our guidance for card runoff in 2014 remains $1 billion. We are updating our expectations for mortgage runoff in 2014 to $5 billion from $4 billion previously.","Turning to slide five, I will briefly cover capital trends. As expected, Basel III standardized became our primary regulatory capital regime in the first quarter. Regulatory capital ratios for periods prior to the first quarter are reported under Basel I.","Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized fully phased-in basis was 11.7% in the first quarter compared to the same number of 10.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013.","With the benefit of phasing our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 13%, up 80 basis points from the same 12.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. While there is still work in progress, industry wide on the final implications for capital under the Basel III advanced approaches , we continue to estimate we are above our target of 8%.","Based on the quantitative and qualitative outcomes in the recent CCAR process, we look forward to returning capital to our shareholders through the approved $2.5 billion in share repurchases over the next four quarters.","The bar surpassing CCAR is high and will likely continue to rise. We have and will continue to invest in our processes to exceed these standards. We have demonstrated our commitment to return capital and understand that remains an important part of return equation for our investors.","Let me close briefly with an update of our expectations for 2014. The early adoption of the new accounting standard for low income housing tax credits and the change we made to prospectively recognize auto reposition expense and operating expenses instead of as a component of vehicle, impact on our outlook for PP&E and its components.","We\u2019ve previously expected pre-provision earnings for 2014 of approximately $9.8 billion excluding extraordinary items. Adjusting for the shift in geography of these two items with the impact of the new accounting standard being a primary driver, we now expect 2014 pre-provision earnings to be about $10 billion within a reasonable margin there.","Looking beyond the impact of these geography moves, we expect some modest or principally offsetting changes with higher revenues offsetting higher expenses.","With that, let me turn the call over to Rich.","Richard Fairbank","Thanks Steve. I\u2019ll begin on slide 7, with an overview of the domestic card business. Ending loans were down about 7% from the fourth quarter driven by expected seasonal pay downs and continuing planned run-off. Ending loans declined about 3% year-over-year. Excluding the planned run-off, the year-over-year decline in ending loans was about 1%.","Purchase volume on general [purpose] credit cards, which excludes private-label cards, which don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 11% year-over-year. Looking below the surface, the year-over-year trends in loans and purchase volumes continue to reflect our strategic choices, which focus on generating attractive, sustainable and resilient returns. We're avoiding high-balance revolvers and allowing the least resilient parts of the acquired HSBC portfolio to run-off.","In contrast, we're seeing underlying year-over-year loan growth in many segments, including transactors and revolvers other than high-balance revolvers. New account originations continue to grow at a strong pace and we continue to see opportunities to increase lines for existing customers, which should improve the trajectory of both loan growth and purchase volume growth overtime. As we said last quarter, we expect these improvements to result in overall year-over-year loan growth in the domestic card business sometime in the second half of 2014.","Revenue margin for the quarter was just under 17%, down seasonally from the fourth quarter. Revenue dollars were down about 10% year-over-year driven primarily by our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio.","Non-interest expenses improved by $119 million from the sequential quarter, driven by operating efficiency and seasonally lower marketing. On a linked-quarter basis, the charge-off rate increased by about 12 basis points to 4.01%. Delinquency rate decreased about 41 basis points to 3.02%. The improvement in delinquencies was better than normal seasonal expectations. First quarter charge-offs in delinquencies include the temporary increase we discussed last quarter.","Recall that in July 2013, we changed a number of customer practices on the HSBC branded card portfolio to align them with regulatory guidelines and Capital One practices. These changes temporarily increased fourth quarter delinquency rate. The delinquency impacted largely run its course which contributed to the improvement in delinquency rate in the first quarter.","We originally estimated that the changes to align HSBC customer practices would temporarily increase the monthly domestic card charge-off rate by about 35 basis points from December through March. The actual impact was closer to 25 basis points and we expect it to diminish to about 10 basis points in April and be mostly out of the charge-off rate by the end of the second quarter.","Looking beyond these temporary impacts, we expect that our focus on resilience and our strong credit risk underwriting will continue to drive strong credit results with normal seasonal patterns.","Our card business remains well positioned. We\u2019re poised to return to year-over-year loan growth in the second half of 2014 despite continuing run-off and our choice to avoid high balance revolvers. We\u2019re delivering strong, sustainable and resilient returns, and we\u2019re generating capital on a strong trajectory, which strengthens our balance sheet and enables capital distribution.","Moving to slide 8. The Consumer banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans declined about $35 million from the fourth quarter and about $2.9 billion year-over-year. Continued growth in auto loans was more than offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto originations increased from the fourth quarter and remain on a strong growth trajectory. Subprime originations were relatively stable, while prime originations grew as we captured additional prime share from our existing dealers. Ending deposit balances grew by about $3.9 billion in the quarter. Year-over-year deposit balances declined about $1.1 billion, mostly in our legacy Capital One direct banking businesses.","Consumer banking revenue was modestly lower compared to the fourth quarter driven by declining consumer banking loan balances, persistently low interest rates and margin compression in auto finance. Non-interest expense decreased $88 million in the quarter as a result of lower marketing expense in our deposit businesses, the absence of several small non-recurring operating expenses we recognized in the fourth quarter in continuating operating efficiencies.","These improvements were partially offset by a change in the geography of where we recognize auto repossession expenses which are now included in operating expense rather than in net charge-offs.","Provision for credit losses improved in the quarter. Auto charge-off rate and delinquencies improved in the first quarter in line with expected seasonal patterns and aided by the shift in presentation of repossession expenses that I just described. Home loans credit trends remain favorable and continue to perform well inside of the assumptions we made when we acquired the mortgage portfolio. The overall consumer banking charge-off rate remains strong at about 1%.","While we continue to expect that auto finance revenues, margins and returns will decline as we move from exceptional levels to more cycle average performance, we remain committed to the auto finance business. We build deep and sustainable dealer relationships, we have developed proven underwriting and customer service capabilities and we expect that the auto finance business will continue to deliver resilient and well above hurdle returns. Additionally, we expect that the [inaccessible] impact of the prolonged low rate environment will continue to pressure the economics of our retail deposit business even if rates rise in 2014.","As you can see on slide 9, our commercial banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. The current and historical results on slide 9 and in our financial tables have been restated to reflect the change in accounting for low income housing tax credits that Steve described earlier. As shown in the appendix slide, the net effects on the commercial banking segment are reductions in revenue, operating expense and income tax as well as the modest decrease in net income from operations.","Loan balances increased about 3% in the quarter and 18% year-over-year, driven by growth in specialized industry verticals in C&I lending and CRE. Loan yields declined in the quarter and compared to the prior year, driven by lower market pricing for increased competition and our choice to originate loans with even better credit quality. Revenues declined 12% from the fourth quarter. Lower loan yields as well as lower tax equivalent yields in our equipment leasing business drove the quarterly decrease in revenue. In contrast, revenues increased about 5% from the prior year. The year-over-year increase was the result of growth in loan and deposit balances across the franchise, partially offset by declining loan yields.","Non-interest expense was up 15% from the prior year as a result of the Beech Street acquisition and continued growth in loan balances. In the quarter, non-interest expense was down about 9% with lower amortization expense and seasonal trends. Commercial credit remains very strong with the charge-off rate at 4 basis points. While the current very low charge-off levels are not necessarily sustainable, we continue to see low levels of non-performing and criticized loan balances, so we expect the strong credit performance of our commercial banking business to continue. While increasing competition particularly in generic middle market lending may continue to impact the pricing and volume of new loan originations, we expect our focused and specialized approach to deliver strong results in the commercial bank.","I will conclude my remarks this evening on slide 10. In the first quarter of 2014, we posted another quarter of solid results for the company and across our businesses. We received no objection to our CCAR capital plan and announced the $2.5 billion share repurchase program that we expect to complete by the end of the first quarter of 2015.","Capital One is earning very attractive risk adjusted returns and we expect that will continue in 2014. But we\u2019re always focused on the important levers that will sustain and further improve our profitability. We are committed to tightly managing cost across our businesses. We don\u2019t view this as a one-off initiative, it\u2019s a major multi-year agenda and it remains the top priority in all of our businesses and in every budget cycle.","Our credit results are strong driven by a long standing discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our continuing focus on resilience. Growth remains a high priority for us, but only in the context of the preemptive focus on generating attractive, sustainable and resilient return. We expect planned run off will drive declining home loan balances.","On the other hand, we expect growth in areas we\u2019re emphasizing including commercial banking and out finance will continue, and we expect year-over-year growth in domestic card loans to resume in the second half of 2014. And with respect to capital, our CCAR submission and our 2014 capital plans are strong evidence of our commitment to return capital to shareholders.","The bar for passing CCAR is high and will likely continue to rise. We have invested and we\u2019ll continue to invest in our processes to exceed these rising standards. Our capital and liquidity positions remained strong. Our businesses continue to deliver attractive and sustainable returns and generate capital on a strong trajectory. Industry loan growth remains low and in our case, planned run-off frees up capital as well. We're comfortable also with our strategic footprint.","These conditions create excess capital that can be distributed to shareholders. We recognized that capital distribution is important to our investors and capital management remains an important part of how we expect to deliver superior and sustainable value to our investors in 2014 and beyond.","Now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session.

I guess first on loan growth, you're still talking about returning positive in the back half of the year. Can you just help us understand some of the drivers behind that? Is it from new account acquisitions driven from the recent marketing spend, is there an expectation that the existing customer base will begin revolving against slower run-off. Can you just tease out what some of the main drivers are?","And then for Steve, just thinking on a longer-term on capital return, you talked several times that the bar does continue to rise. But given the strong capital position all else equal, do you think the current year's capital return is sustainable or given the fact that you don't move to be in advance for several years, we can actually see further increases to capital returns in the near-term? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","Yes Ryan, we continue to be on track to have loan growth in our card business return in the second half of 2014. What\u2019s really driving that is continued success in new account origination; I think we feel very good about the results we see there. On the existing customer base things are going very well and we\u2019ve gotten traction, a lot of traction in the line increase area where I am sure you know that we had sort of a brown out with respect to line increases as we were adapting to a regulatory guideline. So, that\u2019s pretty much back on track.","So we feel good with respect to being able to play offense if you will. With respect to the defense side, every year the run-off becomes less and we continue on our journey of running off also our high balance revolver. And so net-net, the line is finally crossed in the second half of this year and I think we feel good about the trajectory from there.","Steve Crawford","","So Ryan, as Rich mentioned, we\u2019re not at a point where we\u2019re prepared to provide specific guidance going forward and I am sure you can imagine there is a bunch of reasons for that. But in our couple of observations, some of which you\u2019ve heard it from Rich and I already. One, the qualitative bar continues to go up for all banks and I think the good reasons for us to emphasize flexibility in our future capital plans probably means that share repurchases will be a continuing emphases.","And I think in terms of thinking about payout levels going forward, I kind of go back to the way Rich ended, which is we have a really strong capital position and continue to deliver high returns. Industry-wide loan growth is relatively low and in our case it\u2019s magnified by run-off. We continue to be comfortable with our strategic footprint. So, and most importantly, I think hopefully demonstrated over the last couple of years; we understand how important capital return is to delivering enduring value to our shareholders.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Thank you. I guess I\u2019ll ask my couple of questions upfront. Steve, I was just wondering if you could just go over that breakdown of the revision in the PP&E again. Just how much is coming from the specific tax changes versus other stuff of that $200 million increase in PP&E? And then secondly, question for Rich. We\u2019ve had a couple of large players in auto go public recently, one that\u2019s pretty focused on prime and I think I heard you say that you guys took share in prime from dealers. I was just wondering if you could talk about how you expect the trajectory to be going forward in auto lending in terms of growth. Thank you.","Steve Crawford","So let me go first. In terms of the PP revisions, again these are primarily changes in geography. So, we would have approximately $240 million of incremental operating expense. If we have the current standards prevail into this year with respect to how we were accounting for [Litech], we would similarly have $40 million that would stay in (inaudible) instead of moving up to operating expense. These are again approximate numbers that gets you to the around $200 million, which is why the guidance went up from $9.8 billion to $10 billion, again that excludes extraordinary items and we\u2019re not defining that\u2019s the last decimal point.","Richard Fairbank","Yes Sanjay, in the auto business we continue to feel very good about the auto business. We\u2019ve wanted to make sure that our investors understood that the confluence of kind of once in a lifetime event that led to extraordinary return opportunities and exceptional growth opportunities that\u2019s redressing towards the main, but that\u2019s not to take away from that fact that we continue to feel good about the opportunities to be very successful and earn well above hurdle rate returns in this business.","The growth -- basically I think the way to think about the growth trajectory is subprime is pretty flat these days and we continue to grow in the prime space and that\u2019s really just further penetration of the dealers that we have very good relationships with. So it\u2019s kind of a natural to do this growth. And so despite that growing competition and of course we see two players that are now out there with IPOs and they are going to be intensely trying to generate growth, I think we feel pretty good about our position here.","Of course the prime growth, as we get a mix change with more prime growth and more flattish on the subprime side that puts additional kind of pressure on the overall average margin and in addition to just what\u2019s happening competitively.","The other thing just to say on the auto growth side is the -- we continue to keep a close watch on the underwriting practices that are going on in the business. And I think it\u2019s pretty much the same story I have been saying the last few quarters. There is a little slippage on some of the metrics, but overall still more slippage back towards the main as opposed to things that would cause us to really pull back.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Bill check your line.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Hello, can you hear me?","Jeff Norris","We can hear you Bill.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Okay, great. Thank you. You guys had a healthy year-over-year purchase volume growth as did some other issuers that have reported but you as that they also saw a non-interest income decreases in your card segments?","And I was wondering if you could talk to what's driving that? It seems that there is a benefit from the interchange revenues that would be kind of on the plus side, but maybe if you could talk about what else is going on that would be helpful?","Richard Fairbank","Bill on the, so first of all just purchase volume continues strong for Capital One and we think we're continuing to gain share of role in that space. With respect to non-interest income, there are couple of things going on, first of all our interchange growth in the quarter was basically flat despite the significant growth in purchase volume and more importantly the significant growth in general purpose credit card purchase volume.","And I just want to point out, there is a lot of volatility in that particular metric in anyone quarter. But there is also a medium term kind of sustaining phenomenon here where we are very committed to our rewards business and we are upgrading rewards products for some of our existing rewards customers and consistent I think with the industry overall extending rewards product to some existing customers who don\u2019t have rewards. And so near-term you will see some interchange cannibalization as we do this, this is very intentional and it\u2019s all part of building a deeper customer franchise and all part of frankly are deep believe in the power of building relationships through strong rewards business.","The other thing is the late fees were light in the quarter reflecting the delinquency real strong delinquency performance and that\u2019s probably something that a number of other competitors would have seen as well. But a little light on the interchange side and late fees that\u2019s a flip side of a very good credit effect are the contributors to a little weakness on the non-interest income.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Thank you so much Richard, I was hoping I could ask one follow up to Stephen. I had a question on your target 8% common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III I was hoping that maybe you could discuss the extent to which the severely adverse scenario under CCAR could become your binding constraint I was just looking to get your thoughts on whether those two ratios could produce difference answers that could impact what you manage the business to? And that\u2019s it, thank you.","Steve Crawford","","Well that\u2019s a great question frankly it\u2019s a long way off in the future for us and we\u2019ve just had the first couple of banks exit parallel and those banks to my understanding even in the 2015 fee cost they\u2019re not going to be tested assuming the advanced approaches apply. So I don\u2019t think anybody can give you a really good feel as to the intersection between CCAR and advanced approaches. What I would tell you in terms of how we think about our capital that is you start with an assessment of the proper capital levels for our inherent risk. As you know we\u2019ve talked about the company\u2019s use of stress test for many years in assessing how much capital we use. And we\u2019re also informed by relevant experience, we had hopefully the most robust test we\u2019ll have for a while in the great recession.","So a lot of that is the grounding for the capital that we need but moving away from the internal view, there are still moving pieces it\u2019s not just how advanced approaches gets into CCAR I don\u2019t think CCAR is stable at this point. And we haven\u2019t even entered parallel run. So while there is significant uncertainty we believe the 8% target is right and wouldn\u2019t communicate that to Europe, we thought it was fairly inconsistent with the regulatory framework. That\u2019s not a guarantee that 8% is the correct point estimate. But any other number at this point would be speculative and remember our 8% number does include a 100 basis point cushion above regulatory amendments.","Jeff Norris","","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Brad Ball with Evercore.","Brad Ball - Evercore","Thanks. Could you talk about the card revenue margin, the compression this quarter was entirely seasonality or were there others factors and how do you feel about the revenue margin in the context of the growth that you are talking about in the second half, are you thinking around 17% would be still sustainable and then just lastly on credit, the delinquency improvement, I suppose this quarter is what drove the reserve release is there still more room for additional reserve releases going forward, what\u2019s your thought on credit broadly? Thank you.","Richard Fairbank","","Okay. Brad on the revenue margin, yes in terms of the first quarter, the revenue margin for the quarter was 16.9% and that\u2019s down from 17.3% in the fourth quarter and that decrease, you are right was primarily driven by normal seasonality of the revenue margin.","And sort of putting the revenue margin in the context, 2011 the revenue margin was around 17%, 2012 we added the HSBC portfolio and adjusting for a purchase accounting effects the margin was also around 17%. In 2013 after adjusting for Best Buy help for sale impacts and the deal related items, the revenue margin was also in the low 17% range.","The benefits from the removal of Best Buy\u2019s low margin business were roughly offset by what we call franchise enhancement so basically moves that we are making to consistent with our very strong customer advocacy things we\u2019re doing in the company.","And going forward there are going to be many puts and takes on the revenue margin. There will always be some franchise enhancement actions that we continue to take overtime, but I think overall we believe Brad, the margin will remain healthy, we\u2019re not going to give a specific forecast about the revenue margin, but I think we believe it will continue to be strong.","And on credit, yes, the delinquency is what drove the release. It\u2019s just, you probably heard and we keep saying quarter after quarter, it\u2019s hard to imagine things getting much better than this. And let\u2019s really enjoy it while we\u2019re in this part of the cycle. I think we are struck by the strength of the credit performance, we continue to see the relatively low delinquency levels and the low roll rate.","So, I don\u2019t think as we look at it that we\u2019re here to declare that credit is going to get even better, but I think I would say this that the continued strong performance of all the credit metrics reinforces our strength, our belief in the strength and continuation of a good credit performance that can help generate very nice returns in the business.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Hi, can you hear me? Sorry about that. So I just had a couple of questions, and I apologize I got to the call a little later. But one question I have is in terms of your liquidity coverage ratio requirements. Where do you stand on that? How far along you think you are? And how should we think about the impact to net interest margin as you try to make progress on the LCR?","Steve Crawford","Is that it?","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","That was the first question, sorry.","Steve Crawford","Okay. So let me start with LCR. Basically we don\u2019t think there is going to be a material financial impact. It\u2019s a little bit hard to be, too definitive on the ultimate impact because we don\u2019t even have final rules at this point. But I think almost -- unless the rules change materially, we wouldn\u2019t see a real financial impact from this. There is however the greater operational and governance burden that\u2019s primarily a function of having to calculate this ratio on a daily basis and kind of when the industry needs to be able to do that certainly plays into the operational challenges. But we will be able to satisfy what currently it seems like the bar you have to get over which is the 80% LCR ratio requirement as of January \u201815.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just my follow on question is on a different note. I think you announced that you are going to seize working with some sort of providers like payday lenders and cheque cashers and the like. It would be helpful just to get your sense or your perspective on that. Why seize working with all of these providers, why not just start working with some of the ones who are less compliant or is the issue of trying to figure about who is or isn\u2019t compliant with the regulatory requirements? I\u2019d just like to get your thought process as far as that goes.","Richard Fairbank","","Yes. Sameer, we consistently review our business plans across the company and our customers individually and as groups to ensure that they are aligned with our strategic goals and our objectives on all dimensions including regulatory compliance and everything. And we took a number of factors into consideration and determined that the check cashing business being bankers to check cashers no longer fits with our strategic priorities. The financial impact of this exit is really not material. This business was the small part of the overall enterprise.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research","Good afternoon. I guess one question on the guidance and then I had follow-up on auto. Steve, you mentioned beyond the geography moves, so setting aside all that. There were some modest upgrades to the revenue expectations offset by expenses. I wonder if you could just -- what drove the upgrades to your revenue expectations, any sense of magnitude and are the offsetting expenses more on the marketing side or on the operating expense side?","Steve Crawford","Yes. That is down to as you kind of probably anticipate the answer to this question down to a level of guidance in detail that we\u2019re not going to go to like last year. We provided guidance and as we move through the year we really stand it on to provision net revenue. This is a really dynamic business with a lot of moving pieces. And as was true last year, we may get to the guidance that we laid out at the beginning of the year in different ways.","We\u2019ve centered on pre-provision net revenue for a bunch of reasons, but it\u2019s obviously the foundation for our ability to invest the future growth and to return capital to you. Adjusted for changes in geography, we\u2019re not changing our guidance, which obviously excludes extraordinary items. And as Rich mentioned, we\u2019re leaving out the credit story, which remains pretty strong as well.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research","I appreciate that. And then on auto, and I guess with the benefit of hindsight, I mean your originations pulled back a lot in 4Q \u201812 through 2Q \u201813, they\u2019ve kind of reaccelerated in the second half of \u201813 and the various credit data that\u2019s out there for you and competitors, if you guess to the extent there was a problem that was in the first half \u201813 [vintages], in the second half \u201813 vintages are improving or performing better. I wonder if you agree with that. And if -- what was it about the first half \u201813, because it is not obvious when you look at credit cycles or terms across the industry why kind of across the industry first half \u201813 than to just see little weaker in second half \u201813 and first half \u201814 seem to now be doing better?","Richard Fairbank","So I\u2019m not sure what you are referring to, I don\u2019t have our origination data right in front of me, but I\u2019m not sure what you are referring to about a pull back in 2012. My recollection to the following that the auto business spiked early in the great recession. A lot of people exited, we pulled back to our really core dealer relationships and then looked for the inflection points. You may remember that we\u2019ve often articulated that some of the best lending opportunities are actually in the [roads] of downturns when you pass kind of inflection point relating to customer behavior and competitor supply and demand and sort of underwriting standards. And so really into as I recall it was in 2009 and in the 2010 that we really accelerated originations in the auto business and we have continued very strong right through this point all through this period believing this is kind of the best part of the cycle and checking very carefully each vintage.","As it\u2019s turned out, despite our inflection point monitoring and our belief that this was the best part of the cycle and the supply and demand were in a good place, the vintages have actually outperformed in a good way our own expectations. And so certainly in hindsight, we feel very good about our acceleration. And I\u2019m not aware of anything that would characterize the early -- the vintages in the first half or second half of a particular year.","Along the way with these vintages there has been some expansion of -- some loosening of our very tight credit standards back to just tight, if you will. And so a couple of the vintages have had expected higher risk, but overall this has been a continuous period of accelerating originations and very strong credit performance.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","We'll go next to Daniel Furtado with Jefferies.","Martin Kemnec - Jefferies","Hi, can you hear me?","Richard Fairbank","Yes.","Martin Kemnec - Jefferies","Great. Hey, this is Martin Kemnec in for Dan Furtado today. Thanks for taking my question. First, can you kind of help us think about sort of the impact that higher rates have on the transactor strategy and how you guys can maybe potentially look to offset some of the higher cost to carry there? I mean does that strategy become uneconomical with short rates pushing up at some point down the road? And just kind of maybe walk us through what type of leverage you can pull either on the funding side or the reward side?","And then secondly Steve maybe for you, pretty impressive when we look at the recovery levels in the card book, at least what we can see from kind of the master trust seems to be pushing higher in the early part of this year. Is that kind of an organic effect as the economy improves, we\u2019re seeing a little bit better consumer spending numbers, things picking up, or is that sort of an inorganic effect from potentially selling those accounts and then booking the gain there, maybe just an update on the dynamics you\u2019re seeing on recoveries and expectations for that going forward?","Richard Fairbank","","Okay. Martin, let me take first of all your question about our transactor business and its exposure to higher interest rates. We fund the expected lifetime balances for our transacting customers. And we expense rewards as they are earned. So as such, as rates rise, we feel very good about preserving the profitability and the benefits for our existing customers.","Additionally, we subject our investment decisions as you can imagine to worsening conditions in the marketplace including higher interest rates. So, our products have a built-in resilience even at a higher interest rate level.","Of course, should rates rise enough, I think you get kind of to the point that, and all players would be pretty equally affected. I think the industry would probably react and the going forward product structures would logically potentially adapt at that point. But in terms of the exposure to us, we kind of lock in as the best we can sort of all the existing things and we build in a buffer. And then I think if there were an adaptation, it would be an industry adaptation and we would react at that time.","With respect to recovery levels in the card business, I\u2019ll make just a general comment about the recovery levels. In general, recovery dollars tend to come down somewhat at this stage of the cycle. It\u2019s kind of the math of the shrinking inventory of fresh charge-offs against which to recover.","So in general, recovery rates have -- recovery dollars have been coming down just because recoveries are highest on fresh inventories, in the fresh inventories the good news is we haven\u2019t been supplying our recoveries team with as much supply as they\u2019ve been used to, so that\u2019s a good thing.","It is also the case with respect to asset sales -- I mean debt sales. We are probably the lowest, they\u2019re among the very lowest in the industry in terms of extent of debt sales. But those are sort of opportunistic decisions made based on pricing in the marketplace and that can affect any particular quarter for some of the metrics as well.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good evening gentlemen. My first question is bigger picture. Rich, you\u2019ve been a long-term observer in capital and it\u2019s been a long-term participate in the revolving credit market in the U.S. in particular. And I guess looking at the market today in consumers, do you sense that there is a difference or a change in their willingness to borrow? Obviously we\u2019ve seen very slow revolver growth, generally speaking, there is obviously some higher levels of debt still existing from the housing crisis. I wonder how you are thinking about the longer term growth prospects for revolving credit. And I have a follow-up.","Richard Fairbank","Yes. Ken, I think we all in this business have just been struck by for really a number of years now, credit kind of comes in a little better than expected and growth is kind of hard to come by. And I think those are the flip side of the same phenomenon and it\u2019s really what you\u2019re identifying. The consumer is just being very conservative. In some ways Ken, the very thing that sort of frustrates the economy from growing, which is consumers are not spending enough, what are they doing with their money? Well, a lot of times they are paying down debt and just being extra careful.","From a banking point of view, we should all be careful what we wish for here because the flip side of this growth weakness on the borrowing side is a tremendous kind of strength on the credit side and that has been powering a lot of great performance for some of the banks over this period of time.","I do think though it\u2019s part of the macro trend and delevering that frankly consumers and corporations have been doing for a number of years. So, it\u2019s hard to prognosticate, but we generally operate with an outlook that revolving debt will probably be, the growth of revolving debt will be pretty slow.","You\u2019ve seen student lending of course growth has been pretty electrifying over this period of time and we\u2019re not in that business, we\u2019ve had a few cautions about that, but certainly that has been up. And we have been struck too by the strength of auto, borrowing over this period of time, solid borrowing and very good credit performance.","But I think overall, what you\u2019re seeing is the consumer that has I think learned a lot through the great recession and is cautious. And I think that our metrics are probably likely to reflect that for better and for worse.","Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you had -- obviously the revenue margin has benefited from very low funding costs over the last few years and it\u2019s nice to not hear you speaking about 15% revenue margins anytime soon. But I guess, I\u2019m interested in how you\u2019re thinking about defending those margins as rates rise, obviously funding costs have been quite low. And I guess this discussion around whether those core deposits are going to be sticky at these levels is really what I\u2019m getting at, if you can give us any thoughts around that that would be helpful?","Steve Crawford","The business overall was or for card specifically, because I think for the business overall, you can look at our exposure to rising rates and we actually feel pretty good about our asset sensitive position. And that\u2019s going to accrue to the benefit of our shareholders, because we think obviously assets are going to re-price a little bit faster. So, if it\u2019s more of a card specific question, we can deal with that. But I think overall when you look at our position, we compare I think pretty favorably with the peer group.","Jeff Norris","","Next question please?","Operator","","We\u2019ll go next to Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets","","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just the first question, I think someone mentioned the pace of run-off in the mortgage book to accelerate from $4 billion to $5 billion this year and just wondering given what we\u2019ve seen in the [MBA] did installing refinancing activity, is there anything specific to the portfolio, it seems you\u2019re buckling the trend a little bit in terms of slowing prepayments?","And then the second question was regarding commercial bank yields. It did job pretty sharply this quarter. Just wondering if they will continue to compress or this is kind of a new level going forward.","Steve Crawford","","No, there is nothing specific on price revision and increased mortgage run-off, it maybe a little bit I think you have to go back and look at when we provided the guidance and what rates were at that point versus what rates are now. I think you\u2019d probably find there is a better connection there between the run-offs.","Richard Fairbank","","Scott, on commercial yields if we take the year-over-year perspective, loan yields decreased by 44 basis points due to the few factors. I think at the top of our list would be the increased competitive pressure in the market especially in the vanilla markets that have very, very large number of banks competing in it like the C&I sort of generic businesses.","We also have shifted toward, more towards floating rate loans that has had an impact. We\u2019ve always had very high quality originations, but we\u2019ve even shifted toward loans with even higher credit quality and with a bit of trade-off with yields there. And ultimately in terms of how we make money. Our spreads have been somewhat, have not decreased by the same magnitude the loan yield has. It\u2019s partly offset by lower funding cost, but overall certainly the competitive environment is contributing to that. Quarter-over-quarter I don\u2019t think I am going to go into details that we have the total tax equivalent yield that kind of affect that makes a lot of noise. But competitively in the C&I business spreads definitely continue to compress and there has been some weakening in the non-investment grade credit structures as well. So we\u2019re pretty cautious in those spaces.","In commercial real-estate the spreads we see pressure on pricing and limited pockets of weaker lending terms but that\u2019s largely in construction. I think banks are being a lot more disciplined in real-estate and also you have a big difference between the C&I business and CRE business, in CRE the CMBS channel has been largely sidelined while of course the CLO market is back to levels that are pretty close to 2007 level, so that\u2019s putting extra pressure on the C&I business. So -- and again our strategy is mostly focused on specialty lending which is affected by all of these trends but tends to be -- the margins are holding up better because of the more balanced supply and demand.","Jeff Norris","","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.","Chris Donat - Sandler O'Neill","","Hi good afternoon thanks for taking my call, just had one question on the comment about higher rewards that are netted against interchanges. Is this reflecting the growth of the quick silver card and the cash rewards or is this amore of a mix with venture or just broader changes in customer behavior in use of rewards?","Richard Fairbank","","It\u2019s really, it\u2019s several effects, so first of all, we have our flagship venture and quick silver products that have pretty rich rewards for the consumers and as a percentage of our whole book those are growing. Then you have our extension of the richer rewards to existing rewards customers and then you also have extending rewards further to some customers who have not been a reward customer. So all of those contribute to this gap between purchase volume growth and interchange growth and in the -- there is sort of a transitionary period where some of these penetration effects are more noticeable and I flag that only because we\u2019re in sort of one of those kind of periods. But it\u2019s the flip side of our real belief in the power of this business model and in many ways the success of our rewards business.","Operator","","We will take our last question for the evening from Matt Burnell.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Good evening gentlemen. Just I guess a question on the income statement. It looks like professional services costs were down pretty visibly quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. I wonder if that has to do with CCAR preparation or is there is some other factor driving that and how we should think about that number going forward?","Steve Crawford","Yes, I wouldn't over read anything or seasonal impacts in that the CCAR of anything would be a small portion of it and it\u2019s obviously incorporated into our overall guidance for the year.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And just not to get too deep into the weed but commercial real estate growth continues to be high teens 20% year-over-year. And I guess I'm just curious, Rich I understand your commentary about remaining very cautious or diligent in terms of your underwriting. But there are some markets in the Southeast and particularly DC that have been flagged as being relatively aggressive.","And I guess, I'm just curious if you're seeing the same trends in those markets and how aggressive the competition has gotten in those the markets with commercial real estate?","Richard Fairbank","So, again I would say, my overall observation from the market, the blended kind of observation from the markets we\u2019re in is that commercial real estate is quite a bit tamer than the C&I business. And I think it's really just frankly the flip side of the fact that C&I performed so well in the last downturn and is available to so many banks that you have sort of a lot of folks rushing in there. And then you have the CLO impact, the growing CLO impact as well. So, that's the area I'd flag as the biggest concern we have.","On the commercial real estate side, again I think in most places people are licking their wounds and there is generally we see behavior that is more careful but that varies by markets, we don\u2019t do commercial real estate in the southeast so I really don\u2019t have an observation on that, we are relatively small players in DC. But I guess -- and more than half of our, the majority of our commercial real estate in fact is in New York City that has a lot of strong market dynamics going on right now and generally the behavior is not too irrational. But beyond sort of those qualitative descriptions I mean we spend a lot of time looking at key metrics and what\u2019s happening to those key metrics. And when we look at LTV debt service coverage ratio and debt yield in commercial real estate we see things that are well within the guard rails we would look at and frankly are still I think we are still pretty comfortable with how we see those metrics moving in the marketplace, at least with respect to the loans we are originating.","Operator","","At this time I turn the call back over to Jeff Norris for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeff Norris","","Thanks very much and thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call today.

Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance","Thanks very much, Jennifer, and welcome, everyone to Capital One's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our first quarter 2015 results.","With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Steve Crawford, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Steve will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, and then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.","Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. For more information on these factors, please see the section entitled Forward-Looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our annual and quarterly reports which are accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Crawford.","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jeff. For the first quarter Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $2 per share and had an average return on tangible common equity of 15%. On a continuing operations basis we earned $1.97 per share.","Net income was up $154 million driven by higher pre-provision earnings and lower provision expense versus the prior quarter. Pre-provision earnings increased by $69 million versus the prior quarter as lower revenue was more than offset by lower marketing and operating expenses. Provision for credit losses decreased on a linked quarter basis driven by a smaller allowance billed and lower charge-offs versus the previous quarter.","Turning to slide four, I'll briefly touch on net interest margin. Reported NIM decreased 24 basis points in the first quarter to 6.57%. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by two fewer days to recognize income and temporarily higher cash balances. We don't expect any incremental margin pressure to meet the LCR since we're already above the fully phased in LCR requirements as of March 31, 2015.","Turning to slide five, let me cover capital trends. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 12.5% as of March 31. On a fully phased in basis we estimate this ratio would be approximately 12.1%. We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 5.4 million shares or 1%, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions that began last April. Over the past year we have reduced shares outstanding by 24.9 million or 4%.","We entered parallel run for Basel III Advanced Approaches on January 1 and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target. We were pleased with our 2015 CCAR results and believe they continue to demonstrate our strong commitment to return capital to shareholders. Our approved submission include a plan to increasing our quarterly dividend from $0.30 to $0.40 per share. In addition, our plan authorizes the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2016.","Our long-stated preference for the focus of capital return continues to be in the form of share repurchases. And while investors can expect an ongoing ability to generate strong returns and a commitment to return excess capital subject to regulatory approval, investors should not infer a long-term commitment from our recent payout ratios.","With that, let me turn it over to Rich.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve. And I'll begin on slide seven with our Domestic Card business.","Loan growth accelerated in the quarter. Ending loans were up about 9% year-over-year and average loans grew about 7%. We continue to post strong growth and see goods opportunities in the parts of the market we've been focused on for some time. Purchase volume on general purpose credit cards, which excludes private label cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 19% year-over-year. This growth was driven by the success of our rewards programs, increased new account originations across our card business, and credit line increases.","Compared to the first quarter of 2014, revenues were up 7%, in line with average loan growth as revenue margin was stable. On a linked quarter basis, revenue margin decreased seasonally to 16.9%. Year-over-year non-interest expenses increased 2% driven by higher marketing, consistent with our return to loan growth. As expected, non-interest expenses decreased about 6% from the linked quarter with seasonal declines in marketing.","Credit in the first quarter was stronger than expected. We experienced better than forecasted delinquency flow rates. The charge-off rate increased 16 basis points to 3.55%. The delinquency rate improved 35 basis points to 2.92%. As first quarter delinquency favorability rolls through to charge-offs, we expect quarterly charge-off rates in the lower end of our previously communicated mid-to-high 3% range, perhaps even getting into the low 3% range at the third quarter seasonal low point. The improvement in our outlook for Domestic Card credit drove a modest allowance release in the quarter. We also expect favorable credit to drive lower than expected past due fees, putting modest pressure on revenue.","Longer term, our credit expectations are unchanged and are driven by growth math. As new loan balances season they put upward pressure on losses. While this impact on the charge-off rate is modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond. We still expect growth math to drive quarterly charge-off rate to be in the mid-to-high 3% range in the fourth quarter and higher from there in 2016.","In addition, while this quarter shows that we may not have allowance builds every quarter, we expect growth to drive allowance additions going forward. Our Card business remains well positioned to deliver growth with attractive and resilient returns.","Slide eight summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans were up about 1% from the prior year. Growth in auto loans continues to be offset by expected mortgage run-off. Auto originations increased about 10% year-over-year driven by strong auto sales and deepening relationships with our existing dealers.","Consumer Banking revenue was up 1% year-over-year driven by growth in auto loans. Revenue continues to be pressured by persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances, and margin compression in auto.","Provision for credit losses grew $66 million to $207 million, driven by a change in allowance. In the first quarter of last year we had a modest allowance release. In the first quarter of this year, growth in auto loans and normalizing auto credit drove an allowance build.","Our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing industry headwinds. Persistently low interest rates will continue to pressure returns in our deposit businesses, even if rates begin to rise in 2015.","In our auto business, we've been experiencing normalization of both credit and returns from once in a lifetime levels coming out of the great recession. Credit performance is gradually worsening in the industry and we see slightly higher losses on newer originations. We've been cautious on industry underwriting and competitor practices for some time. As a result, our subprime originations have been essentially flat for nearly two years.","In the first quarter, we observed increasingly aggressive underwriting practices by some competitors, particularly in subprime. We are losing some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. And used vehicle values remain at historically high levels. A decline in used car prices would put pressure on our results, but we assume lower prices in our underwriting, so we remain comfortable with the resilience of the business.","Despite our heightened caution, we will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers.","Moving to slide nine, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Ending loan balances increased about 10% year-over-year with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals, in C&I and CRE. As we've been signaling, our year-over-year growth is slowing compared to prior years in response to market conditions. Loan balances declined modestly from the linked quarter as we've seen some slippage in industry underwriting standards in pockets of the market.","Revenues increased 13% from the prior year driven by growth in average loans as well as increased fee income from agency multi-family originations. These factors were partially offset by loan yields which declined 25 basis points compared to the prior year driven by increased competition. Non-interest expenses were up 7% from the prior year as a result of growth in our portfolio and continuing infrastructure investments.","Provision for credit losses increased $28 million in the quarter to $60 million. The provision in the quarter was primarily driven by an allowance billed for our $3.6 billion of loans to the oil and gas industry driven by the impact of lower oil prices.","We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. 96% of our loans are secured and 73% are shared national credits. Our largest exposure is in exploration and production in which we benefit from holding loans at the top of the capital structure and is counted in collateral values. Many of our borrowers are least partially hedged against falling oil and gas prices.","Our second largest exposure is in oilfield services in which our customers face greater downstream challenges as E&P companies cut back in response to low asset prices. We're working through these issues on a customer-by-customer basis. We are also a lender in the Taxi Medallion Finance industry, with a small portfolio of less than $1 billion in loans. Medallion values have softened because of increased competition from new entrants like Uber. We continue to closely watch this sector.","Overall, commercial charge-offs, non-performing loans, and criticized loans remain strong. While we continue to closely manage credit risk, we don't expect these levels to be sustainable through the cycle. Our Commercial Banking business remains well positioned to navigate a challenging environment in which intense competition continues to put pressure on growth, margin and returns.","I'll conclude my remarks this evening on slide 10. Capital One posted strong results in the first quarter. We're delivering attractive risk adjusted returns today, and we expect that will continue. For the full year of 2015, we expect growth in revenues driven by growth in average loans.","As you can see in our Domestic Card business, we are experiencing very strong growth. And in this window, we are likely to increase marketing to take advantage of the opportunities we see to help sustain the current trajectory. While growth opportunities would drive long-term value creation, the higher marketing and the higher operating expense of additional volumes will put pressure on efficiency ratio.","As a result, we are likely to be in the higher end or possibly modestly above the 53.5% to 54.5% efficiency ratio range excluding non-recurring items. We're managing costs very tightly across our businesses to stay within the range, but we will also strive to make the right business choices to drive long-term value as growth opportunities unfold through the year.","Pulling up, our strategic priorities for 2015 have not changed, and we remain focused on the levers to create value and sustain strong performance. We'll continue to pursue growth opportunities. We'll maintain our long-standing discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus on resilience.","We'll manage costs tightly while we invest to grow, be a digital leader, and continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. And we'll actively work to return capital to shareholders, as capital distribution remains an important part of how we expect to deliver value to our investors.","And now, Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance","Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.","Jennifer, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Hi. Just wanted to follow-up on the update to the efficiency. I think you guys came in at roughly in the middle this quarter. And I was just wondering, Rich, can you give us a little bit more clarity on how we should think about the incremental costs that you need to spend on marketing and how it flows through to loan growth? How long of a lag should we see on growth? And then I'll have a follow-up.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ryan, our initial guidance on efficiency ratio, we did I guess three quarters ago. We updated it for the dramatic changes in interest rates. And over this period of time, there have been \u2013 we have constantly responded to the growth opportunities we see in the marketplace. We've continued to invest to capitalize on those opportunities, and we've continued to refine our forecast, if you will, of what are the actual growth numbers that we think will come in the near term. And kind of the byproduct of all those moving pieces has been \u2013 leads to my commentary on the efficiency ratio.","I mean, the bottom line is \u2013 to grow we need to spend money. We believe this is a very, very important window of opportunity, and we're taking action to capitalize on that and along the way working very hard to manage sort of one minus, the cost of that, and keeping our investors posted along the way.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then just following up on your outlook on credit. You talked about a mid-3%s charge-off with the exit run rate closer to the mid-to-high 3%s. How should we think about the impact on the provision if loan growth is sustained at these levels? Should we expect the provision to track charge-offs and then build for \u2013 and then have a subsequent build for loan growth? And then just related to that, Rich, you commented that it continues to increase as we move into 2016. At what point do we actually start to see the charge-offs leveling off?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","So let me take the provision. There's obviously two parts of provision. There's a charge-off component and then there's what happens in your allowance. So you have one piece of that already in the charge-off guidance, but that charge-off guidance in and of itself is also a contributor to what's likely to happen to allowances. So let me back up for a second because I know this is a continuing question and just try and give a little bit more help.","At the highest level, we build our card allowance, and actually it's not too different anywhere, but let's talk about our card allowance off of three different things: what the loan balance is at the end of the period; what our charge-off forecast would be over the next 12 months; and then there are qualitative factors which really cover the risk that are not captured by models. So if you're really trying to model the allowance in future quarters, you're going to need to make assumptions on all of those, the growth rate and the assumption for loans. And remember if you're not doing a year-over-year growth rate, you've got to think about the seasonality because they can run off in different ways.","Next you also would need to however \u2013 whenever you want to forecast that for the balances, look at what charge-offs are over the next four quarters after that. And then with regards to our qualitative factors, they've been about 10% to 15% in benign periods but they can vary pretty significantly if you're entering or exiting a credit cycle.","So I'm trying to give you a little bit of a picture of why small movements and assumptions can create swings in a quarter which end up being meaningful. And the most impactful of the three assumptions is really the net charge-off rate and just looking at this on a static basis with our current loan balances of $74 billion, a 15 basis point change in loss rate in a quarter, all other things being equal would drive $100 million change in allowance.","As Rich talked about, in the first quarter we experienced better than expected delinquencies and flow rates. So the starting point for our next 12 months loss forecast has shifted down and as a result we had allowance releases. Had that not happened, growth would have actually probably driven allowance builds. So going forward it's a combination of growth and our expectations for loss that suggest that we're going to need allowance builds. But it's really hard to go a lot further than that given all the factors that I've been through. Hopefully that helps Ryan, in the way you think about constructing what could happen to allowance.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ryan, and then in terms of the trajectory of losses, it's interesting, you may remember last year we flagged at this time kind of a similar phenomenon that we saw this year that better than expected flow rates and then just seeing those flow rates kind of mechanically, we put a \u2013 given the six-month window that we have, that we can watch delinquencies flow into charge-offs, you can see that we've adjusted our projections for that six-month window.","You may remember last year that this phenomenon that we saw around this time last year in the latter part of the year we said we saw most of it dissipate. So we are not assuming that this changes the outlook for the end of the year or beyond, and if that changes, obviously we would \u2013 if this phenomenon sustains itself, obviously we would adjust that.","So we are here today with the same kind of outlook that we had last time we were talking to you and it is just very clear that the growth math and you can see the pretty dramatic growth numbers that we have, the growth math just pretty much has to carry the day. And that's why we're looking to the fourth quarter as still the mid-to-high 3% range, and then we are saying and then 2016 would be up from there. And we're saying up from there just again by the vintage math of growth.","And all of this is in the context of a kind of unique time in the industry and for Capital One where most of our customers that we have right now on our book, they weathered the great recession and are very low-risk and I think exceptionally resilient. So it's pretty much anything we book moves the numbers up from here. We feel great about the credit quality of what we're booking but the growth math is just very inexorable in that sense.","Now you asked the question: when will this level off? We are reluctant to be predicting something that's going to have a lot of factors driving that when we get there. But I think our point is that 2016 will be a year of rising charge-offs off of the trajectory with which we leave 2015 just because, again, the accumulated math of the vintages of the new business that we're booking.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to Bill Carcache from Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. Rich, I was hoping that you could update us with your current thinking on the strategic importance of the international credit card business and perhaps talk about its growth outlook. And maybe tie in reports this quarter that Capital One was cutting its credit card rewards in the U.K. and how that may influence how you're thinking about it.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Bill, first of all, I want to say that most of you may be aware that in both the UK and in Canada, there have been regulatory-based moves to lower interchange. Neither of our businesses there, particularly our UK business are highly dependent on purchase volume for the economics of the business. So I don't think this will have a big impact on our particular overall economics even though it's an important move in the marketplace.","Already a number of issuers have come out in response to the lower interchange rates in the UK and have notified their customers that future rewards will be at a lower rate. I think that's pretty natural in a tight margin business, and the rewards business is a very tight margin business with the interchange and the high payment of reward benefits. That's pretty natural market phenomenon and we already see that going in the UK.","Interestingly, there's been some pushback and noise on the consumer side because consumers really do like their rewards and I think we should all take note that even in a country where the rewards rates are lower, there is some pushback there, and I think it's a reminder that in the U.S. consumers who are enjoying higher rates of rewards are pretty vocal for us, for the preservation of these benefits.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you, Rich. That's very helpful. I appreciate that commentary. If I may ask a bit of a high level question on what we're seeing in the partnership business. The view I believe I've heard you express in the past is that you like the partnership business, but that your optimism is somewhat tempered by the fact that contracts come up for renewal every five years or so and the potential exists for outsized profits to get competed away in that process. I know I'm paraphrasing, but that's the sense I've gotten from your commentary.","But there are others in this space who are expressing a bit more of an optimistic view on partnership businesses and kind of taking \u2013 talking about how the thing that they're most focused on is how their merchant partners are looking for them to help them drive incremental sales growth and they talk about how their pipelines are very strong. And so I guess the question then is what do you think is driving these differences in views that some folks in the partnership business are a little bit more optimistic in their outlook and that's it? Thank you very much.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, thank you, Bill. First of all, I think in many ways it's all relative and relative to what. So as one who built this company initially on a direct to consumer model one customer at a time, you have seen the long history and current performance of that business, and it a little bit spoils me relative to pretty much everything else in the banking business. And I kind of start from there for my calibration.","And frankly, the big difference between \u2013 as you said, between the regular direct to consumer credit card business and the partnership business is the holding of auctions that happens on average every five years. And that tends to, all other things being equal, be quite a mitigator in terms of some of the upside potential. So many of my comments have been just that calibration. The partnership business is a very interesting and intriguing one to me and for a lot of the reasons that you cited, others are talking about.","As you know, the retailing business, for example, is in massive strategic turmoil. And the impact of digital and the need for retailers to reinvent themselves is an extraordinary in many ways kind of existential kind of imperative. And I think that companies like Capital One that are doing very significant investments in digital and in mobile and in not just the customer experience associated with that, but all the underlying infrastructure that is behind what it takes to actually innovate in digital, companies like ours I think are in a very good position to partner with retailers and help them strategically and actually in terms of real product innovation and execution in that transformation. So we are also investing in that opportunity and we have partners with whom we're working right now on some pretty cool digital innovations.","And so look, that's one reason I like the space a lot. It's also such a natural sibling to our regular branded business. But what we're doing is we're \u2013 how do we deal with sort of this overhang of the auctions? We just make sure that we never say we have to win no matter what. We go out there. We're selective relative to making sure these are great companies we're working with, companies that are in the partnership business with us for the right reason, where it's really motivated to build a franchise and not just for the making of near-term money that sometimes comes at the sacrifice of customer practices. And finally selectively where the ultimately the price of the deal is something where both parties can win.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. I guess I got a question on credit quality again. So the seasoning math was supposed to impact 2015 and I guess now it's not. So what's really driving that better performance? Is it fuel prices or something else? And I have one follow-up after that.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sanjay, I think in the very near term there is \u2013 as we grow, there is some what we call a speedboat effect that growth in the near term sort of has a depressive effect a little bit before it inexorably raises the charge-offs some months down the road, but that's really a small effect. I mean mostly what \u2013 essentially what we're talking about here is something that we've seen on not infrequently over, for me, the 20-year history of being in this business, is that from time to time we notice that all our flow rates, our delinquency flow rates move in a similar direction all at one time.","And usually when this happens, there's not necessarily an explanation for it. Often we're able to go back later and tie it back to economic data that comes out later and so on. Now this is not a huge effect. I don't want to get carried away. I've seen much bigger effects in other times. But because we have actually gone out to give sort of quarterly guidance, all we're saying is coming in better than the quarterly guidance in the relatively near term relative to when we did it just relates to better than expected flow rates without having a perfect explanation there's probably some general economic effect that is going on. But then our most important point is that we don't necessarily see any evidence that this should change our longer term view about the trajectory and magnitude of the charge-off we're talking about.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Understood. And then the follow-up question is just I want to make sure the expense take-up on the guidance, that's just more opportunistic spending, right? And to the extent that you're being opportunistic, can you just about where those opportunities are? Thanks.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The opportunities, we are \u2013 gosh, the more things change, the more they stay the same. For a long period of time, Capital One, well, pretty much always in our history, we have always been one to invest in growth opportunities. The investments begins by investing in innovation, in testing, in brand building, and in creating and looking for opportunities. We're real students of the windows of opportunity. And then when we see them, we tend to seize them because we've also learned markets continue to move. So that's the phenomenon that's going on here.","Where we are seeing the growth opportunity is pretty much in our branded book across the board where we are investing. And we are pretty much investing in all places other \u2013 as we've talked about \u2013 other than high balance revolver. So pretty much one minus that is where the opportunities are happening there. And they're a byproduct, again, of a lot of work over the years, behind the scenes and investing in things to be in this position. But there's something that still requires us to invest quite a bit in marketing and the associated cost of growth as the opportunities continue.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Rick Shane from JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks guys. You talked a fair amount about the provision on the credit card side. I'd like to talk a little bit more about the provision on the commercial side, which you'd sort of talked about some of the qualitative factors that drove the increase in provision, but I'd like to relate it back to Steve's comment about how you think about reserve levels. Obviously, this quarter we saw a pickup in provision, pretty substantial without any deterioration in credit. Obviously, that's forward-looking related to what you see going on in the oil patch. I'm curious if there're specific credits within the portfolio that you've already identified as particularly at risk, or is this just a generic reserve related to the qualitative factors Steve talked about?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Well, the comments that I was making were really directly off of card. But let me address commercial. As Rich said, that was really driven principally by energy. And if you think about that, it's a little bit of both. It's a little bit of specific credit observations. It's a little bit of trying to get ahead of what we see in the marketplace using our historical experience, developing a scenario and making sure that that's reflected in our provision and allowance as well. Those are the things that are really driving the number in the quarter. One of the things I would say is we're early in the cycle, but we're obviously trying to use the experience we have in energy to forecast what could happen.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And I'll bootstrap a follow-up question a little bit. Are you seeing anything on the consumer side in the oil patch that has you concerned at this point as well?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. When we look at geographical segmentations of where there is the greatest oil-related activity in those more local markets, we do see a tick-up in some of the consumer credit metrics that you would expect. Nothing dramatic at this point, but it is visible in the markets that are most highly concentrated with respect to oilfield activity.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to Don Fandetti with Citi.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Rich, you've been pretty cautious on subprime auto for a while now. It seems like your comments today are perhaps a little more cautious. And what do you think is driving the more aggressive lending, let's say, this quarter? Because it's interesting. Credit looks like it's actually gotten a little better in subprime. And is it the smaller players? Can you talk a bit about that?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Don, there are a lot of different practices people use in the industry and underwriting practices and we all use them on a sloped basis. So it's not like, well, there's a practice; we don't use that one or when do we require this kind of collateral or this kind of information for a particular loan? It is the intersection of the particular practices as it relates to a particular customer and the credit risk of that customer that has moved for some players. And it is not a universal thing. Some players have been more aggressive than others.","And we just been around long enough to know the key thing is we very much have a culture around here: people don't live with growth targets at Capital One. We forecast growth when we think it's going to come, but people all know that job one is to raise your hand and flag when you see opportunities, and the most important thing is that we go after resilient business.","We are flagging some of \u2013 yes, we've ticked up a little bit our commentary on this, although we have been talking for quite a while about it. We talked -- in many ways taken two different perspectives. Partly what we've said over time is just understand coming off a once in a lifetime, unique situation of incredibly tight credit and incredibly a conservative borrowers, some of the kind of loosening that's going out there would be in the category of normal reversion to the mean.","Some of the stuff that we're flagging here would, I think, be on the other side of that. But on the other hand, this a not something where we're saying, oh my gosh, this is \u2013 you're going to see us just pull out of this thing. We still believe there is selectively very good opportunity for Capital One to go get the assets that we want and continue to build and even expand the number of dealer relationships that we have. But we wanted to just put the Street on increasingly on notice in the sense for this \u2013 that we're very carefully watching the practices, and we're going to make the choices that we make for resilience, and we hope that there're really in many ways two offsetting forces with respect to growth.","We're clearly losing deals one customer at a time sometimes that we might have won in the past because others have moved farther in their underwriting. On the other hand, some of the innovations we have and the really sustained success in building deeper dealer relationships, moving up through their prime relationships and expanding dealer relationships is a force in the opposite direction that still generates growth. So the net effect of those two things will drive our results. You can see that, in general, subprime is where we have \u2013 you don't see that much growth going on anymore and most of it really has been in prime lately.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. And then what is the percentage mix over your recent card loan growth between existing and new accounts? And do you \u2013 in terms of the seasoning, I guess you see more of the seasoning impact on new accounts. Is that a fair assumption?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, the only seasoning that one would have on existing accounts \u2013 well, first of all, existing accounts always, the outstandings ebb and flow with people's spending and borrowing and just general kind of ambient activity. The only big mover on the existing file would be line increases and having been in sort of a brownout period for a couple of years with respect to line increases, as we said, getting back into line increases led to, if you will, sort of a surge of catching up for a second. We're on the slightly higher side of equilibrium probably at the moment, I would say, there.","The seasoning of those is a different seasoning dynamic with respect to new business. The line increases tend to \u2013 all the economics of line increases have upfront \u2013 it's sort of upfront very good things, doesn't cost much to get them. There's no kind of spike of diabolical behaviors or anything. So what you tend to have is \u2013 and for a while people use their line to pay any obligations and so on. So what you have there is more of a steady, delayed sort of rise in charge-offs over time with that vintage. That is an important but minority part of the overall growth right now. It's an important minority, shall we say.","The majority of the growth is coming from the origination side of the business or from recent originations and the very immediate credit line moves we might make relative to those. But I put that all in the category of originations. The vintage dynamics for that are very different. First of all, all the economics are upfront. You take all your pain. You've got your high cost to originate, the big allowance builds. There's even sort of a \u2013 the peak of charge-offs comes pretty early and then moderates over time so that sort of all the good news aspect of that thing happens over time. The majority of our growth is coming on the origination side, but there's a sizeable minority that is on the line increase side. And that's approaching an equilibrium now. It's on the high side of equilibrium.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks. Rich, you talked a little bit about the rewards in the UK coming down a little bit on tight interchange in the market. Could you talk a little bit about your outlook for the U.S. where rewards have generally gotten more aggressive and the like in the prospect of perhaps at some point seeing a higher interest rate environment and whether that will have any impact on the industry?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sorry, Moshe. Repeat your question...","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Basically, you've had aggressive rewards competition. It's been increasing both on a co-branded and also just even on cash back and mileage type programs. The question is, does that turn around? Does it turn around if interest rates start to move up when profitability on a customer who's basically using the card like a charge card would go down?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, Moshe, you're talking about a sector that, as long as I've been around it, has been pretty intensely competitive. Now it tends to be lopsided relative to a lot of competition from a small number of players and sort of modest involvement from everybody in the business.","This rewards space is \u2013 certainly is still very competitive. And the recent manifestation of extra competition there has been, early spend bonuses have continued to rise. That's probably the most noteworthy thing. I think others in general have come out with products that are a little better than what they have for the existing books. So there's a little movement on product value and continued competition on early spend bonuses. So we have our eye on that.","And of course the other place for the competition of course is just in the amount of marketing. And people are stepping up the amount of marketing as well. So overall, I would say there has been modest, pretty, pretty modest, now in the overall scheme of things, sort of increase in the intensity of competition there. Now you talk about \u2013 so in the context of all of that, as rates go up at some point, I think a sizeable increase in interest rates will probably have a fair amount of impact on that. I wouldn't expect modest interest rate changes to impact that too much. But I know, Steve, you've spent a lot of time thinking about this. What were you going to say...?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, just with respect to interest rates, three observations. First, when we book new accounts, we fund the balance, what we assume the balance is going to be, going forward. So there's not rate risk as you would say on the existing book. The rewards that we have are obviously that we're accumulating are expensed. And as Rich said, the underwriting that we do on the accounts does assume some stress level in the rate environment, so it's not booked based on current spot rates. So there's a lot of thought into the interest rate risk associated with the business.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And just as a follow-up, any update on what you're seeing in your relationship with Costco in Canada? And if not now, when do you think we'd hear about that?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We're excited about our new agreement with Costco. This was launched in September of last year. And of course we're the exclusive credit card issuer for the retail brand in Canada. This didn't, by the way, just didn't come with a portfolio acquisition. So this is really one that we're sort of, from scratch, working to build the customers. And as the first \u2013 in the first six months since the partnership launched, we're seeing pretty strong demand as Canadian consumers appear to be certainly very willing to take up what is a quite attractive MasterCard product.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Steve, if you wouldn't mind, can you just clarify what you meant in your comment about the payout ratio going forward just so I understand it in the context of what Rich concluded with in terms of the payout outlook?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Look, we'd ask you to look more at our actions and our commitment to return capital over the last two years. I don't think you'll ever see us, certainly not in the near term, but my guess is probably ever committing to a payout ratio. The business is just \u2013 we'd like to retain the flexibility. And obviously, if opportunities arise or the economy changes, there can be a whole bunch of things that change.","In the near term, you saw that this year our test improved a fair amount in terms of how the Fed looked at us, which was good news. And we hope things continue to move in that direction. But we can't be assured that that's the case. The other big uncertainty we've talked about and continue to have going forward is how CCAR and advanced approaches will come together. So there's just a whole bunch of reasons why we don't want people to lock into what we have done over the last two years and just assume that's the minimum going forward.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. So you're really just underscoring the need to maintain capital flexibility in light of competitive conditions and a continuously evolving regulatory environment.","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Absolutely.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. All right. Thanks very much.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Bob Napoli from William Blair.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just a question on growth and a follow-up on regulation. Just the \u2013 Richard, what do you expect, what are your thoughts on the growth rate of your credit card business? You've had very strong growth, accelerating growth, as you said, helped by credit line increases as well as your branded product. Are we done with the credit line increases? Are we going to continue to see an acceleration in that business? And \u2013 I mean your spend growth in the U.S. is pretty amazing compared to the industry. And I guess that's credit line-driven as well. So outlook for growth. And are we \u2013 which products, and are you near the end of the credit line increases?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, Bob, let me talk about the outstanding growth, to start with. That is being driven somewhat by line increases and also by the success of origination programs on, sort of across the various parts of \u2013 across all the parts of the business that we're investing in. So, on the line increases, I guess, my description was, we're on the higher side of equilibrium, but they're sort of approaching an equilibrium level. But we're probably on the bit \u2013 on the higher side of equilibrium there.","On the spend side, that is \u2013 that's driven by \u2013 I mean you were kind of right where you're going in a sense. The spend is, yes, partly the success we have in the rewards programs we have, it's also people filling up their lines in a sense, either coming from line increases or a lot of new originations where people are starting to ramp up their spending there. So there's a number of things that have come together to make really quite extraordinary spend growth.","And all of that I think is reflective of \u2013 if I kind of pull way up and just talk about our growth here for a second, the growth that you see here \u2013 and Bob, you've known Capital One for a long, long time. Our strong growth is really driven by the investments we've made in the last few years and the current market dynamics that represent a window of opportunity. And we're continuing to invest to try to sustain this trajectory. And I've just been around long enough to know that life's about windows of opportunity. And the way Capital One works is, when we see windows, we really do kind of go for it.","We also, interestingly, if there's a reverse window, if you will, when we think market dynamics get in a kind of negative sense, we, a lot of times, exceed the market in the other direction, sometimes in pulling back. But this is one of those things where a number of things have come together and the byproduct of a lot of investment and opportunities, some digital innovation that's going on, and we'll capitalize on it as long as it lasts.","We're reluctant to give a growth outlook because almost by definition, when you're growing at some of the kind of rates you've seen here, it's just hard to predict where things go from here. But we certainly are continuing to invest. And that's reflective in some of our comments about on the cost side.","Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. And just on regulation, are you seeing \u2013 are we getting near the end of the increase in regulatory costs? Do you have any sense that things are settling down? I mean you hired 5,000 people over the last year and there's a lot of investment, I don't know what \u2013 I mean how much has regulation pressured your business from an operating expense and operating perspective? And do you feel like maybe you could see the light at the end of the tunnel or not?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I don't think you could probably find a bank executive in the entire United States that would predict that the increase in regulatory costs has come to an end. So, Bob, I think there are some companies who have gotten themselves in a very complicated situation and are trying to rectify some sort of big, very public problems and things like that. I think for us, the philosophy that we take and look, the regulatory bar dramatically increases every year. And I mean every year including even the \u2013 the other day, I was giving a presentation to our associates and just listing within the last 12 years, a big, long kind of list of things that have sort of raised the bar in the past year.","The approach that we're taking is to say let's try to seize this opportunity, seize the regulatory moment, not just to fill out a checklist and get our \u2013 all of our to-do requirements done, but to work backwards from what it takes to build a really dynamic, well-controlled company in the modern kind of era, if you will, and work backwards from that and make sure that what we're putting in is consistent with a dynamic company that can innovate and do a lot of things and also embrace the spirit behind so many of the regulatory requirements that the world is really expecting and demanding a very high level of execution. And we're going to try to step up to that bar. Along the way, the costs frankly keep going up, Bob.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good evening. Just had a question on some of the new partnerships that you've been announcing. I think you've done some work with innovative companies, like some of the firms out there on the West Coast and wanted to get a sense of how much your technology investment spend has helped you to be a leader and helped you to announce these kind of partnerships early on? I'm talking about what you recently announced with Uber.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So well, Betsy, first of all, with respect to external digital parties, there's a lot of manifestations of Capital One's commitment to digital. We've done a number of partnerships. We've done a number of acquisitions like Adaptive Path, Level Money, and things like that. We've done a number, a very large number of recruiting successes, including some pretty high-profile folks that we've brought in.","One thing is absolutely clear and it's \u2013 and we believed this from the beginning, that every bank is going to need to transform itself. The digital revolution is changing banking on just about every dimension that you can imagine basically. It's changing what it takes to win in payments, in distribution, in marketing, in brand, foundational infrastructure, experience design, if you will, the way information is used. And in the end, that really means the role of talent is central to that kind of transformation.","And so in the talent marketplace, in the partnership marketplace, I think these folks, you can't just go out there with a checkbook and say here we are. We're here to bring you into the fold. I think these folks look to see and they come in and kick the tires to say, is this a company that's bolting digital onto the side of a traditional bank? Or is this a company that is really, like in our case, trying to build a really leading information-based technology company, in a sense?","And the key manifestations of that are inside the company. Are the leaders committed? Are they digitally fluent? Have they digitally reimagined their business? Are they bringing technology talent not just into some like place in IT in a sense, but is it really being brought right into the heart of the business and become sort of who you are?","So when you heard me talk a lot about digital, it's just that this reminds me a lot of 20 years ago sort of building an information-based company. I'm incredibly excited and sobered by what it takes to actually really build an information-based technology company, and I really like our chances. And along the way, as we go on that journey, the more success we have there will correlate also with a lot of people from the outside saying, you know what? That is the kind of company that I think speaks our language and is one of us. And you'll see more of the kind of partnerships and successes that you alluded to.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","That's great. And just a follow-up on that is on \u2013 the impact on real-time payments. I know there's obviously a lot of work streams going on at the Fed regarding trying to move the payment system to be real-time settlement. I'm sure you've thought a lot about that and are working on that as well. I'm just wondering what kind of opportunities does that potentially give to you as real-time payments come to fruition.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, gosh, there's a lot of dimensions to that particular thing. It is ironic that the banking system is from stem to stern built on a batch basis. So you pretty much look at anything, and from the old direct mail stuff that Capital One and so many of us have done over the years, the whole way clearing works.","And so \u2013 and really, while there are many, many aspects to the batch nature of this thing, right at the center is this irony that in a world that increasingly is going toward pure electronic payments, there's a massive kind of, oh yeah, lag in the end to make those things fully happen. Most banks \u2013 pretty much all of us banks have built middleware layered to, in a sense, simulate real-time, even in the context of a reality that's very much batch-based.","I'm not sure that real-time payments will actually transform banking as much as a lot of people think it will. But the reality of when the world moves, if we pull up from real-time payments and clearing technically to the larger point of the world moving to such immediate interactivity and such a mobile world, the really dramatic transformation that's going to happen to banking is it's going to become real-time, far beyond kind of real-time payments. And I think that \u2013 I think banks are so, in a way, ill-suited to drive to that destination, yet the world will drive us banks there.","I think that you kind of put your finger on something from a broader point of view that I think is at the heart of the whole reinvention of banking that is coming. It's just that for banks to get there, the banking system and for banks individually, there's a lot that that entails. And we're going to need to think more like technology companies and maybe a little less like banks.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question today will come from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks. Just following up on that, what do you think it would cost in time and money to transform the company into a real-time entity?","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Capital One?","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yes.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean in some ways, I mean it's a lifelong, forever journey. This is not like we're going to say by next year, we're going to be real-time. I'm just saying, so from a journey for me that started 20 years ago and looking at the banking industry and saying in many ways this is really the information business, not necessarily just the traditional banking business. I'm saying the world has \u2013 it's very clear at the accelerating rate that the world is moving, the ability to \u2013 the dimensions of how information is leveraged, the real-time nature of information and the software revolution that has changed everything, the connected revolution here.","Working backwards from that will be a lifelong journey, but I think that the companies that, for all of us, it will be gradual. But as we continue to leverage those opportunities, I think the difference between companies that are really taking advantage of that versus companies that are following the more traditional model, there will \u2013 in the end, this is going to translate, I think, into growth opportunities and economic differences and a number of things that are pretty significant. But this is something in a sense that is going to be a lifelong effort for banks like ours.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","But you think it will take a long time.","Richard D. Fairbank - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In some sense, it'll probably take forever because the world's going to keep moving that fast. The main thing is that we already see the benefits of some of the things we've been investing in and some, one of the important drivers of some of the growth opportunities we have right now is coming from the digital innovation that we have spent a number of years doing.","Jeff Norris - Senior Vice President Global Finance","Well, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us on the conference call this evening and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One.

To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2018 results.","With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Scott Blackley, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Scott are going to walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors and click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion in the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials.","Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

And for more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our Annual and Quarterly Reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC.","And with that I'll turn the call over to Mr. Blackley. Scott?","Scott Blackley","Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $1.9 billion or $3.71 per share in the second quarter. We had three adjusting items in the quarter, which are outlined on page 13 of tonight\u2019s slide deck.","We had a $400 million gain from the previously announced sale of our mortgage portfolio which was recorded in our other category. There was a $49 million build in our UK payment protection insurance customer refund reserve and we had a $15 million charge for restructuring events related to our previously announced business divestitures.","Net of these adjusting items, earnings per share were $3.22. In addition to the adjusting items, we had a non-recurring adjustment to a vendor agreement which reduced operating expenses in our card segment by around $75 million in the quarter.","Pre-provision GAAP earnings increased 13% on a linked quarter basis and 15% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion. Provision for credit losses decreased 24% on a linked quarter basis and 29% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by allowance releases in our Domestic Card and Auto businesses.","Let me take a moment to explain the movements in allowance across our businesses, which are detailed in Table 8 of our earnings supplement. Improving delinquencies and lower charge offs resulted in a $72 million allowance release in our Domestic Card business and a $77 million release in our Auto business. Also the impact of the home loan sale and the transfer of the remaining portfolio to held for sale resulted in allowance decrease of $54 million.","We increased our commercial reserves by $41 million in the quarter as we increased our allowance coverage ratio. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.1%. Excluding discreet items and the impact of the UK PPI reserve build, the quarterly rate would have been 21.2%. We continue to expect our 2018 corporate annual effective tax rate to be around 20% before discreet items.","Turning to Slide 4, you can see that reported net interest margin decreased 27 basis points on a linked quarter basis. About half this decrease is seasonality as card customers typically increased payments after tax season, which is only partially offset by having one more day in the quarter.","The other half of the linked quarter decrease was largely driven by three factors, the contra revenue portion of the UK PPI reserve build, a temporary increase in our cash balance due to the mortgage portfolio sale and finally the accelerating cost of deposits, which we believe will be a continuing headwind going forward.","Turning to Slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 11.1%. We completed our full 2017 CCAR authorization purchasing 800 million or 8.4 million shares of common stock in the quarter. As previously announced, following the Federal Reserve\u2019s non-objection to our 2018 CCAR plan, our Board has authorized repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2019. And we expect to maintain our quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share, which is subject to board approval.","Our current view of our capital need remains at around 11% of CET 1. We believe that we have sufficient earnings power to support growth and capital distribution. As I mentioned last quarter, how the capital frameworks ultimately incorporate the effects of CECL may impact our longer term view of capital.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Rich. Rich?","Richard Fairbank","Thanks, Scott. I'll begin on Slide 8 with our Credit Card business. We posted strong year-over-year growth in pretax income driven by revenue growth and significant improvements in provision for credit loss. Credit Card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our Domestic Card business, which is shown on Slide 9.","In the second quarter Domestic Card ending loan balances were up $7.8 billion or about 8% compared to the second quarter of last year. Average loans also grew about 8%. Second quarter purchase volume increased 17% from the prior year quarter.","Revenue for the quarter increased 3% from the prior year. Growth in average loans was partially offset by a decline in revenue margin. Revenue margin for the quarter was 15.9%, down 74 basis points from the second quarter of 2017, largely driven by the expected margin pressure from adding the Cabela\u2019s portfolio.","Non-interest expense for the quarter was down about 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating expense in the quarter benefited from about $75 million in non-recurring items that Scott discussed. Improving credit trends were a significant driver of second quarter Domestic Card results. The charge off rate for the quarter was 4.72%, down 39 basis points year-over-year.","The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.32%, down 31 basis points from the prior year. We\u2019re now on the good side of growth math. Credit performance on the loans booked during our growth surge in 2014, 2015 and 2016 has now turned and is improving year-over-year. This improvement is a good guy for overall Domestic Card credit.","Pulling up the competitive marketplace remains intense, but generally rational. Supply of card credit is on the high side, although it continues to settle out a bit and our growth initiatives are gaining traction. We see increasing opportunity to grow card loans.","Slide 10 summarizes second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the quarter we completed the sale of substantially all of our Home Loans portfolio and we summarized selected impacts to segment results in the commentary section on Slide 10. As you can see on Slide 10, ending loans decreased about 22% compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was more than offset by the Home Loans portfolio sale.","The Auto business continues to grow with ending loans up 8% year-over-year. Competitive intensity in auto is increasing, but we still see attractive opportunities to grow. Ending deposits were up 4% versus the prior year with a 29 basis point increase in average deposit interest rate compared to the second quarter of 2017.","We expect further increases in average deposit interest rate driven by higher market rates and increasing competition for deposits as well as changing product mix as our national banking strategy continues to gain traction. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter increased about 1% from the second quarter of last year with growth in auto loans and deposit offset by the Home Loans portfolio sale.","Non-interest expense for the quarter decreased 9% compared to the prior year quarter driven by the exit of the mortgage business, the benefits of prior branch rationalization and our ongoing efforts to tightly manage cost.","Provision for credit losses was down from the second quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of strong credit performance in our Auto business. The Auto charge off rate improved compared to the prior year quarter. Recall that second quarter charge-off rate last year was elevated by changes in how we recognize bankruptcy related charge-offs.","Adjusting for these impact, the auto charge-off rate still improved modestly year-over-year in the second quarter. And as Scott discussed favorable credit trends drove an allowance release. Over the longer term we continue to expect that the auto charge-off rate will increase gradually as the cycle plays out.","Moving to Slide 11, I'll discuss our commercial banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances were flat year-over-year and average loans decreased 2%. Both trends were driven by our choice to pull back in several less attractive business segments in the second half of 2017. With many of these choices behind us, ending loan balances increased about 3% from the sequential quarter. Ending deposits were down 6% from the prior year driven by increasing price competition.","Second quarter revenue was up 1% year-over-year as strong non-interest income in capital markets and agency offset the decline in average loans and the effect of the lower tax rate on tax equivalent yields. Non-interest expense was up 7% primarily as a result of technology investments and other business initiatives.","Provision for credit losses was $34 million in the quarter down 76% from the second quarter of 2017 driven by lower charge-offs. The charge-off rate for the quarter was essentially zero. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.1%. The criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.3%.","In the second quarter Capital One delivered year-over-year growth in loans, deposits, revenues and pre-provision earnings. We tightly managed costs even as we continued to invest to grow and drive and to drive our digital transformation. We saw credit improvement across our businesses and growth math established itself as a good guy for overall Domestic Card credit trends.","We continue to see opportunities to book attractive and resilient loans in our card, auto and commercial banking businesses and to grow deposits in our consumer banking business. We continue to expect marketing in 2018 will be higher than 2017 with essentially all of the increase coming in the second half of the year.","And we continue to work hard to drive operating efficiency as we transform our technology infrastructure and change the way we work. After two years of significant improvement, we expect 2018 operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments, will be roughly flat compared to 2017.","While efficiency ratio can vary in any given year, over the long-term, we continue to believe we will be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gain. We expect long-term improvements in efficiency ratio will mostly come from improving operating efficiency ratio.","Pulling up, we continue to build an enduringly great franchise with the scale, brand, capabilities, and infrastructure to succeed as the digital revolution transforms our industry and our society. Our digital and technology transformation is accelerating and we\u2019re strengthening our position to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create long-term shareholder value.","Now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.","Leanne, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Bruce","Thank you, good evening. My question really relates to the growth that you see in the US credit card business. You kind of suggested that you\u2019re seeing opportunities to grow again. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s in the sense in the prime area and the subprime area, could you give us any sense as to what that product mix will look like going forward obviously you had a shift in the quarter.","Scott Blackley","Right, Ken, first of all let me just comment on the mix shift in the quarter. So our asset mix percent subprime is 32% down 4 percentage points year-over-year. And that\u2019s basically close to our historical portfolio mix of about a third plus or minus. An important part of that reduction is the addition of the Cabela\u2019s portfolio which is kind of a heavily prime oriented portfolio. Also our credit lines have been a little bit lower the last couple of years. So but that is - our strategy remains the same.","And so and that\u2019s also as I turn now to your question about where is the growth opportunity, we see the growth opportunity across the spectrum of where we play. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any important strategic change here we just I think as you know we always talk about the marketplace and we try to give a calibration of where we see opportunity. And we see the growth picture looking a little bit more positive now that\u2019s partly in the context that Capital One\u2019s growth has been pretty modest over the last year and even the last quarter or two we\u2019ve said as we look out actually we see a more positive picture and I would again say that.","So we like what we see in the performance of recent vintages, we see promise in our innovation pipeline and we\u2019ve already said we expect marketing levels to be higher, so I think we see an enhanced growth opportunity over time.","Ken Bruce","Thanks. And just there\u2019s been some speculation about Capital One\u2019s involvement with the Wal-Mart private label card and the co-brand. Can you and I understand you\u2019re not going to comment specifically on any particular transaction but can you lay out for us what would be one of the, what would be a classic retail partnership for Capital One? What makes it work specifically for Capital One?","Richard Fairbank","So as you know the card partnerships business Ken is an [auction] [ph] based business. So in that way that we believe and we said for a long time. We\u2019re not out to go just be the very biggest of course we love to get growth opportunities when they emerge but it\u2019s certainly all about fit and discipline frankly in the context of the auction process. So to your question what do we look for we look for a strong partner fit in a world where a lot of companies out there certainly a lot of retailers and overall companies in America are struggling in the context of the rapidly changing environment we look for a strong partner with strong brands and a cultural alignment and a commitment to the card program, as an avenue for growth.","We look for a partner that\u2019s motivated for the right reasons. If you look at the spectrum of card partnerships out there and it\u2019s essentially the partners behind those card partnerships. On one end of a continuum are the partners who view the card program as the central element for building a franchise and deepening customer relationships, the other end of the continuum is partners who sort of view the card program as a profit center, and we have consistently kind of tried to focus on the former side of the spectrum because not only is that where we think the better opportunity lies also the value that we have to add to what we can bring to the table in the context of a lot of our digital capabilities and underwriting and marketing would be consistent with those players who really are looking to card partnerships as a means to grow and really build a franchise.","And however important card partnerships were in the past I think we should all understand they\u2019re more important in the emerging digital world just because of the centrality of how payments play and in the digital e-commerce environment relative to in the physical environment. The final thing that we look for is an economic deal that\u2019s attractive and especially in light of the good growth opportunities that we see. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been saying for years about the partnership opportunity I think the key thing is that we have felt and expressed so many times is it really needs to be a story of selectivity and discipline and that\u2019s a window into how we view those things.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks. I saw that you put the impact of what the home loan business did for the - it was in the consumer bank for Q2 but can you talk a little bit about any balance sheet restructuring that you might be doing and things that might as you go through the second half of the year and things that could continue to help improve net interest income or net interest margin as a result of that or other actions that you can take?","Scott Blackley","Hey Moshe, thanks for the question. With the sale so we sold around $16.8 billion of mortgages in the quarter. We\u2019ve reinvested a significant portion of that, around $9 billion went right into our investment portfolio and so that that was to really preserve liquidity associated with that. We used the rest of that to reduce our overall funding requirements. So we more or less already worked through all of the balance sheet dynamics of that and if you think about what that might mean to net interest margin on the one hand we\u2019ve gotten those home loans out of the book but we added the AFS securities actually we put them in to help maturity so we\u2019ve added those into the portfolio. So we do see a little bit of a pickup overall in terms of the margin but it\u2019s going to be pretty modest given the fact that we reinvested a substantial portion.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks. The follow-up is talking - Rich you talked a lot about kind of you continue technological investments and the importance of payments. Could you talk a little bit about how any tools that you think you might have with respect to that could be brought to bear in the partnership area with respect to that the technology investments that you\u2019ve made payments?","Richard Fairbank","Well there are I think are - so there\u2019s kind of two approaches to a partnership business. One can build a lot of custom technology associated with any particular partner or on the other hand one can build general capabilities that would be very compatible with partners who are really looking to build a franchise. And the way our tech transformation has happened by design which is really about building foundational technology and sort of working up the technology stack to create a lot of digital capabilities and flexibility within our card business that is a very natural thing to bring into the partnership business. So our philosophy is more create a way that we can help our partners ride on our technology path as opposed to go create a new technology path and one partner at a time. And that\u2019s really just about and what I\u2019m struck by I think at the end of the day, many companies, most companies in businesses in and around what we do have a set of capabilities that they need that are on a shared path of the very kind of thing that we\u2019re building. So as we\u2019ve said over the years that one of the benefits of our tech investment should be our ability to be a better partner out there.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good evening, guys. Maybe I\u2019ll start with credit so which we\u2019ve clearly seen growth math transition from a headwind to a tailwind. If I look you provision $6 billion annualized run rate year-to-date, if I look at the next year consensus assuming something in the $7 billion plus $7.5 billion plus range. I was just wondering given that growth math has transitioned to as you referred to the good guy. Can you just tough but the puts and takes on credit and given the backdrop how should we think about provisioning given that losses in almost every business are now down on the year-over-year business?","Scott Blackley","So I think the way to think about it. At times I kind of have a joke in the past say over the last year that we\u2019re almost ready to retire growth math and then I kind of said actually that that\u2019s kind of all that misses an important nuance about how growth math works. And our earnings power is created in a business with high upfront costs and course the way growth math works is that when there\u2019s a surge of growth losses accelerate early on in the cost of those and then things finally settle out and then all other things being equal.","There is a very gradual if not dramatic but a very gradual kind of good guy out there in terms of a gradual decline in charges for as long as that vintage is around all other things being equal. And so this is why we kind of adopted the language here that credit for that growth surge of 2014 through 2016 has turned to be a gradual good guy. So I think the way to think about credit and the credit outlook for Capital One is to think of you\u2019ve got the growth math which is kind of turned to be a good guy and then of course credits going to be impacted by the competitive cycle and other industry effects and by the economy.","And with respect to that, the card industry as enjoyed a pretty long period of benign performance and we\u2019ve seen losses kind of gradually pickup as people\u2019s growth rates have gone up et cetera. But I think given where we are in the economic and the competitive cycle, I think it\u2019s very reasonable to expect that card industry losses probably have an upward tilt over time. And so you got the card industry effect and then in and to whatever one\u2019s assumption about the card industry in fact I would just overlay the sort of good guy of growth math with Capital One and that how to think about that\u2019s basically how we think about our current outlook.","Ryan Nash","Got it and if I could ask one follow-up, if you just talk strategically about what you\u2019re doing in the deposit business and you talked about the potential for a changing product mix. Can you expand on that and what you think it will mean for the deposit business overtime?","Scott Blackley","So we have talked for really for years about building a national banking strategy. Let me just comment on that for a moment and then talk just a little bit about mix. So as you know in a Capital One is really quite an anomalous institution relative to institutions that are anywhere near our size in the sense that we are not really even though they were the size of the biggest regional banks Capital One is national and just about everything that we do and especially our consumer business is where scale really matters the most.","Information scale, brand scale operating scale, customers scale I think digital really increases the importance of scale in frankly, in different ways. But so in banking, we\u2019re we have a local bank in about 20% of the nation and a national direct bank in the other 80%. So while I think the history of banking is to the history of the quest of banks to build national banks is through buying other banks. We are more organically building our national bank and basically trying to go do it by not building how banking works today but in a sense trying to go where banking is going within physical distribution in key metropolitan areas and for us a full suite of products at the forefront of digital capabilities and a brand with a digital lean to it.","So I think this is a natural for Capital One because we can leverage our national customer base investments in technology and transformation and digital transformation and our national brand. So this is been a strategy that been playing out gradually over time for Capital One. Let me now turn to the mix point, that the we launched our what we call 360, Capital One 360 money market account a couple of years ago and that competitive with the large national direct banks and we have seen solid growth in this product and also and we expect to continue to lean into our national banking strategy and so I think the mix of in a sense the National Bank component relative to the local banking component.","I think the mix will you already see it happening inside Capital One. I think the mix change will continue that\u2019s more of a capital one point but then along the way of course we also have just what\u2019s happening in general with the competitive environment with the rates. So a combination of the natural thing that\u2019s going on with the rates and the fact that we or our organically growing a National Bank these are factors that will lead to both the gradual mix change but what it will sum up to is say increasing cost of deposits is a very natural byproduct of the marketplace and our strategy.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Had a question on CCAR and obviously with a lot more onerous this time around and it\u2019s going to get onerous more onerous all as equal. With all the discussions of the portfolio deals out there, was anything else but capital return asked in this past a mission and I guess Scott as you\u2019re looking ahead and talk it through CECL. Had there been any progress made on discussions with regulators?","Scott Blackley","Yeah. Sanjay, thanks for the question. So when I look at what happened in CCAR really the decrease in the netter [ph] year-over-year in CCAR was really driven by three primary things. The first thing is that and this was an overwhelming driver. We really saw that the impact of tax reform was a significant component of the increase in losses that we had in CCAR and that that caused the decline in our netter. And we think that was primarily driven by the Federal Reserve\u2019s modeling of deferred tax assets and that with the Tax Act there was a lots of an NOLs and it looks like that in the pulling corporate it out into their modeling of deferred tax asset so that was a significant component of the decrease. And then yes we had a more severe scenario and as you know and as we\u2019ve talked about there were some adjustments to model that impacted us card and some prime auto which had an effect as well but the biggest of those things being the effect of the change in deferred tax assets.","I would also just mentioned that in our modeling we did not include the noted that include the impact of our mortgage sale that was done after the submission and we were not able to incorporate that because you can only incorporate itself that have concluded in your CCAR model so that kind of gives you a sense of the puts and takes what happened in CCAR.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, just a follow-up question on the credit quality, Rich, obviously being on the good side of growth math. When we think about how it manifests itself to the charge-off rate going forward over like the short to intermediate term. Is it fair to assume that that small tail that you had of growth math is now completely out of the charge-off rate and then as you alluded to the mix get an improving towards prime and super prime. Will that be an additional tailwind to the credit metrics? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","Okay. With respect to the small tail of growth math, yes I\u2019m actually glad you asked that question because definitionally what the small tail of growth math meant was as the surge \u2013 as the impact of the growth surge settles out and starts to turn the small tail math a slight up a modest uptick in charge-offs related to the surge in growth. That is actually now a good guy so it\u2019s got the other sign it\u2019s modest on the other side but thank you for that clarification opportunity there.","With respect to mix, the mix the subprime mix which dropped several hundred basis points in the quarter. That was I really would not view that is any important change that\u2019s going to play out and in the future in the sense I mean the Cabela\u2019s effect is an enduring one so that we should all internalize that. But as I said earlier, we are our strategies pretty much the same across the credit spectrum that we have had we think the growth opportunities will be that we see opportunities across the spectrum and we our bullishness about being able to improve growth there be it off a fairly low level at the moment but the optimism that we have is really one that kind of spans the spectrum of what we do and so I think you should look more for consistency there.","So I just to come back here CECL question we\u2019ve submitted a response to the Fed NPR on the CECL. I know there\u2019s been a variety of an industry discussion going around about how CECL might impact capital and how the capital regime might be adjusted will this happen see how the Fed takes all that feedback and what they may do from here.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. Rich, just one question on the auto space, it seemed over the past few quarters the competitive intensity may have decreased a little bit with the exit of one significant new and used bank player but recently that players indicated that they\u2019re coming back to the market. Are you seeing any change in competitive conditions in that lending math?","Richard Fairbank","Eric, we are seeing a change if there is let me try to just kind of in formally just kind of across the last several years. Try to calibrate this thing because the auto business I\u2019ve said many times, the auto business is hypersensitive to competition even more so than the card business because there\u2019s a dealer standing in the middle of every transaction and the dealer when the dealers see a particular lender who is more aggressive or has a loser underwriting or whatever there is a big movement that way and they try to drive others there as well. So this is an important question that you\u2019re asking.","Years ago, so in the wake of the great recession with the retreat of a whole bunch of players we had kind of once in a life time competitive situation. And then we said, look it\u2019s only going to get more competitive for there and things gradually became more competitive over the years still there was significant opportunity there. It\u2019s sometime of around 2015 as I recall 14, 15 time period we started flagging, we were concerned about competitive practices it was competitive things partly a supply issue and a practices thing. But we saw supply increasing but we saw some competitive practices and we raised some alarm bells about that and Scott maybe help me with the timing here but I think sometime near that last quarter of 2015, we actually had a pretty significant decrease in origination volume around there related to this competitive intensity and the practices.","A couple of quarters after that so I think now we\u2019re into sort of the middle of 2016 we saw that some of that, the competitive practices started I think competitors were pulling back a little bit from that and then we saw another player start pulling back significantly so from let\u2019s call it a good part of 2016 and pretty much all of 2017 there was again this is sort of in the middle of the competitive cycle or even competitive that the economic cycle is moving well along this anomaly that the card business had less than you would expect competition either to be the auto business excuse me, thank you, Jeff.","What we are seeing in the context of that is more competition returning a little bit more frequency with respect to practices that were not fans of but I the way I would describe it is this is returning more to the way things were a couple of years before this. We still see good growth opportunities but it is very clear that the usual window that we enjoyed for about a year and a half, we should not expect that to be there and we what is our expectation is things will return to a more normal competitive environment and it will move along in the cycle as things do. But we still see good growth opportunities but we know which direction this thing is moving.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thank you. And if I may just one quick follow-up on NIM, Scott do I understand that it seems that this current level of card 6.7 is sort of the run rate level from here, but it seems like given the mix of asset growth and the deposit or just funding beta phenomenon that biased continues to be to the downside. Is that a fair characterization?","Scott Blackley","I think that you\u2019ve got to kind of unpack all the things that are running through now. First of all, with respect to rates we\u2019ve been talking about this for a while but we\u2019re effectively neutral to rates and so I wouldn\u2019t expect that if rates follow implied forwards, you shouldn\u2019t see a lot of movement for us against that type of a change. And then I thought I said in my talking points about half the decline looking back on the prior quarter was a seasonal pattern and you historically seen NIM kind of drop down in Q2 and then climb back from there and that is really associated with the timing of some tax, seasonal payments that come in and that\u2019s offset a little bit by some day count.","And then in the quarter, the other half of kind of what was going on there were really three factors, one was the contour of a new Porsche in the UK PPR reserve, obviously that\u2019s a quarter only impact we had the additional cash that we carried because of the sale of the mortgage that\u2019s also a quarterly impact that wouldn\u2019t continue and then we talked about the accelerating cost of deposits which we do think will continue to be a headwind.","So when you kind they work your way through that there\u2019s really the one factor thing that we think is going to be a continuing headwind in is going to be the cost to deposits but we\u2019ll also see kind of puts and takes mix on the business and what the balance sheet ultimately looks like so that\u2019s kind of the recipe that I would describe in terms of where you should think about him going from here.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Donald Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Donald Fandetti","Hi, Rich. Two part private label question. One, have you made any executive changes in that area and then number two a little bit more complex. If you could talk about sort of how you weigh let\u2019s say doing a large private label deal with alternatively just doing more general purpose cards and other parts of your business because you look at private label they do tend to skew lower on credit the pricing obviously is pretty competitive you have CECL a tougher fact on cards and lastly they do tend to be very high touch where you can sometimes need a hundred people site at the retailer and so there\u2019s arguably execution risk et cetera and how do you look at that over the return so good or is it more of a longer term scale type thing that you\u2019d be considering as well?","Richard Fairbank","So I think in the so we talked often about the partnership business and the card partnership business and it\u2019s a very natural sibling to having a branded business. We have tended to lean harder into going out to win general purpose programs generally than private label just only because there is just one whole not just synergy more with our own credit card business and we really like the opportunities to build customer relationships where they\u2019re we\u2019re doing everything we can to increase sales with the partner but also leveraging the opportunities to get out of store or out of partner sales which in a number of partners can be a very significant thing as well.","So general purpose cards I think have some structural advantages over the private label. But it\u2019s all part of the sibling businesses that exist right next to what we do that\u2019s why we\u2019re in both of them and we evaluate one opportunity at a time.","Donald Fandetti","Okay. And I don\u2019t know if they were able to come. Okay. If you were able to comment on any staffing changes or maybe you can\u2019t really talk about that?","Richard Fairbank","We don\u2019t talk about staffing issues on call.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Richard Shane with JP Morgan.","Richard Shane","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And I want to follow-up on something that Scott mentioned. Scott, you talked about essentially $75 million expense true up related to a vendor obviously I really can\u2019t mean that vendor. But if you could give us a sense of the nature of that relationship in any implications in terms of the business going forward?","Scott Blackley","Yeah, Rick. Thanks for the question. You can imagine that for a company of our size we have a number of large vendor relationships and so during the quarter we concluded the negotiation that resulted in some adjustments to the outer arrangement and we had some release of a accruals. And so that\u2019s a onetime thing that they came and went and as we mentioned that hit our card segment so you know where to put that.","Richard Shane","Got it. I\u2019m curious if it\u2019s perhaps related to credit reporting or storing in particular?","Scott Blackley","Well. I\u2019m going to have to let you continue to gas because I\u2019m obviously not going to comment on specific vendors or areas that \u2013 that\u2019s not something that I think makes sense for us.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Robert Napoli with William Blair.","Robert Napoli","Thank you. I appreciate it. Rich, it is to be muttered with your views or on the health of the consumer from a spending perspective is that a slight deceleration in your spend growth I think across the industry slightly deceleration. Are you seeing the any more conservative consumer at all and just your views on where we are in the economic cycle would be interesting?","Richard Fairbank","Yeah. I think pulling way up the economy certainly looks strong over the short term and I think consumers are benefiting from job growth, wage increases and tax cuts. And tax cuts have both had some benefit on take home pay for taxpayers but of course through the large corporate and business tax cuts I think will increasingly make their way through hiring and investment by companies.","Now, so all of that is just all sort of things that stimulate. I think beyond that we\u2019ve been watching most closely things like debt growth and competitive intensity which impact consumer credit over time and we've seen some pullback in that growth recently although it\u2019s still the growth of revolving debt growing at 5.3%, the growth of non-mortgage debt so that\u2019s been lending [ph], auto lending and installment lending is down a bit that growth is down a bit also but it\u2019s at 4.6%. So what is clear is that the total indebtedness of consumers is growing.","So I think just as we look at it over the near term you\u2019ve got a number of planets sort of aligning in a good way that sort of pulling up on the economy beyond that beyond the near term there longer term issues like in addition to the consumer indebtedness growing government deficits, trade issues and sort of the big sort of gradual demographic shifts that are that are going on.","So we operate with a view that this benign economy which by the way is heading toward record levels for how long it\u2019s been since the last recession. We should understand and embrace it for what it is but not mistake that for things that are structural because I think a number of the structural elements probably operate in the other direction.","Robert Napoli","And then I guess on the spend trends I mean a slight are you seeing, there seem to be a slight the deceleration I mean it\u2019s like hard but I mean are you seeing any change in spend? Is there any that have to do with the shift of Easter maybe?","Richard Fairbank","We had quite a bit of growth going on and our consumer spending and I think that probably more result of Capital One specific things that are going on I would there is no near term sort of development on the spending side that we would note but I think we should all be cautious consumers of the consumers behavior lately as we make our business decision.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Wharton with JP Morgan.","Steven Wharton","Good evening. I just wanted to follow-up one more time on the NIM. So you said that you expect that that happened, the decline sequentially would do the seasonality which I understand. But then you also mentioned that the impact of the contra revenue portion of the UK PPI reserve also impacted the NIM. Does that go away in 3Q and how much for that?","Scott Blackley","Yeah. So the way that UK PPI works you book some of it has a return of revenue and so it actually comes in as a reduction of revenue or contra revenue which will impact just the quarter and that was roughly sized in the 3 basis point range.","Steven Wharton","And then you also mentioned the sale of the mortgages themselves but then you said you\u2019d reinvested the proceeds of securities. So is that to imply then that the impacted to the NIM sequentially from the whole mortgage and security thing that that\u2019s pretty much in the run rate. Is there\u2019s not going to be a change sequentially from here?","Scott Blackley","That\u2019s correct. And so we did hold some higher cash during the quarter as we work through putting that to work which was again another drag to NIM and it was roughly about the same size as the UK PPI either.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good evening. First question on capital you indicated that for your CCAR submission that was before the mortgage sale had been finalized so now that you\u2019re at 11% where you need to be and you\u2019re creating capital obviously with earnings. Would you consider going in for either de minims or a top up request for a capital return later this year?","Scott Blackley","Well Betsy we those are certainly options that are available to us and what I would just say is as we\u2019ve done in the past. We\u2019re going to look at all of our options all the levers that we have to deploy capital whether that\u2019s capitalizing growth distributed to shareholders and we definitely recognize that that\u2019s a really important way for us to drive value for our shareholders so we\u2019ll be we\u2019ll be looking at all of our options going forward.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks and then Rich you mentioned earlier the subprime obviously having fallen in the quarter. How much of that was your own actions verses your customers that try to increasing given the improvement in the economy obviously we get a positive cycle drift in a strong economy and that that the other part of the question here is does it give you room to then we invest in that customer\u2019s side going forward or are your new loans that you are originating more likely to be above 660. Can you just some color there? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","Yeah that I would doubt that if I could drift over any short period of time would be a very big factor I haven\u2019t specifically looked at that but I wouldn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t place too much on that. That we don\u2019t operate with a precise the subprime mix target, it is striking for how many years we have been around one third. So whether this number was that 32% or 35%, I don\u2019t think would have much impact on our pursuit of opportunities to us much I mean if it\u2019s the mix get way different than normal.","Obviously we always watch it but I think the main thing is what is the nature of the competitive environment the nature of the consumer and probably most importantly the results of all the tests that we\u2019ve done and the vintages and we put it all together to just to calibrate what is the opportunity that we see and in my point is been Capital One is spend posting some pretty modest numbers on the lower end of the league tables for a number of quarters.","For a variety of reasons but part of it probably was as we\u2019ve talked about term pulling in around the edges on some of the choices and things like that. I just think if we look at the opportunity we see some increased opportunity off of that lower base and that opportunity is across from is really across the spectrum all the way to the very top of the market.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Christopher Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neil.","Christopher Donat","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask one of your auto lending side of the business and about the mix of it because with the prospect of tariffs on imported new vehicles I\u2019m just wondering what percentage of your business is used at this point?","Richard Fairbank","Chris, we have not we don\u2019t give out that that number. However, certainly relative to a number of auto lenders, our mix is more toward the use side because we do not have a big partnership with a captive, a captive auto finance partnership that for some of the banks out there can lead to very significant volumes of new loans.","So we\u2019re really more taking the mix of business that exists in the non-sub vented big part of the marketplace, but relative to the overall US marketplace that is shifted more toward the used car side. So with respect to your particular point, we probably have less exposure than some others might.","Christopher Donat","Okay. That\u2019s helpful for me. Helped me understand the risk.","Richard Fairbank","Yeah.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our final question tonight comes from Chris Brendler with Buckingham Research.","Chris Brendler","Hi. Thanks, good evening. Thanks, Rich excuse me and I just wanted to ask on the US consumer credit card business interchange growth lagged spending growth by a little bit, but still pretty solid low double digits. Can you comment at all about the rewards environment and how it\u2019s affecting your numbers and how you feel about the competitive intensity of the US card business especially among trends actors and your success there? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","Yeah, Chris. The rewards let\u2019s talk of this call it the heavy spender business is a very competitive business. And it\u2019s been very competitive for really for a long time. But marketing levels are intense the competition in reward the I think the most notable thing over let\u2019s say the last say five years was the step up in rewards competition products and that kind of thing in the sort of 18 months to two years ago time period. And also not just for the banks but also at the same time Co-brand offerings. I think all of that continues to be intense I would describe it more as stable recently at an intense level. Upfront bonuses continue to be aggressive although they have also seemed to stabilize and are down of the real high they went to over a year ago.","So I think this is a business where in order to succeed one has to there\u2019s a lot more than throwing products out there this is really I think a company needs to and there are a small number of players who would fit this description I think committed to what it takes to be in this business and build the sustain levels of brand equities over time to committed to the same levels of marketing that is required there and the investments from digital to high level servicing and everything else.","So for many years we have been kind of all in on this business. We believe that it continues to be a good opportunity you\u2019ve seen capital one really for many years posting quite good growth numbers and I think into the teeth of a very competitive but fairly stable marketplace we see continuing positive opportunities to grow this business and to build a franchise which can be very profitable over the longer term and very resilient and be the cornerstone of a brand franchise that we are building.","Chris Brendler","You think that brand is actually helping you gain market share without be as aggressive rewards or even investing in this brand for decades now and I would think that you\u2019re actually getting some benefit, some market share gains from the power of your brand.","Richard Fairbank","I think brands a very important part of this thing. I don\u2019t think a company I don\u2019t think a bank can just win this game by just product offerings, it\u2019s too easy for people to match product offerings this there\u2019s so much more and there\u2019s great product offerings now all over the place. So I think it\u2019s really about a comprehensive all in strategy it\u2019s all about franchise and it\u2019s all about brand and customer experience and the key point I would leave with you is we have literally leaned into this business with a tremendous amount of priority and investment and focus for a whole bunch of years and I think through all the kinds of up and down in the competitive marketplace I think you\u2019ve seen some pretty consistency in the growth numbers that we\u2019ve been the organic growth numbers we\u2019ve been able to post in this business and we\u2019re optimistic for our prospects overtime.","Jeff Norris","Thank you for joining us on the conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One.

Scott?","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with slide three. Capital One earned $1.1 billion, or $2.14 per share in the third quarter. Netting the adjusting items in the quarter, earnings per share were $2.42. Adjusting items in the quarter, which can be seen on slide 13 in the appendix of tonight's slide deck, included the following: $108 million or $0.14 per share of restructuring charges related to realigning our workforce as our business continues to evolve and we change the way we work; $105 million or $0.14 per share related to the impact of closing the Cabela's acquisition in the quarter. This included $76 million of allowance build, and $29 million of deal-related costs.","In addition to these two adjusting items, I would also like to highlight two notable items that impacted the quarter. First, we had $114 million or $0.15 per share related to the estimated impacts of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. We have included a slide in the appendix of tonight's deck outlining hurricane impacts.","And secondly, we had $69 million of gains, or $0.09 per share, related to investment portfolio repositioning that we did during the quarter. Pre-provision GAAP increased 4% on a linked quarter basis, and 10% on a year-over-year basis to $3.4 billion. Provision for credit losses increased 2% on a linked quarter basis, and 15% year-over-year. We have provided an allowance roll-forward by business segment, which can be found on table 8 of our earnings supplement.","Let me take a moment to explain the movements in allowance across our businesses. In our domestic Credit Card business, we built $330 million of allowance in the quarter. That includes $76 million for the onboarding of the Cabela's assets, and $35 million related to the estimated hurricane losses. We expect that the hurricane effects will impact delinquencies in the fourth quarter in charge-offs in 2018.","Allowance in our Consumer Banking segment increased $16 million in the quarter, driven by a $23 million auto allowance build related to estimated hurricane-related losses. Net reserves in our Commercial Banking segment were impacted by the change in value of tax medallions during the quarter. As a reminder, since last year, all of our taxi medallion loans have been carried at the lower of cost or the fair value of the medallions.","During the third quarter, we continued to see deterioration in taxi medallion values. This had two effects. First, we marked the entire loan portfolio to the lower fair value estimate. Second, we moved the remainder of our performing asset medallion loan portfolio into non-performing asset status. As a result of these effects, we took a net provision charge of $92 million, which was comprised of $167 million of net charge-offs for the updated portfolio valuation, and which was partially offset by $75 million of allowance release related to the loans that we moved from performing to non-performing status.","Turning to slide 4. You can see that reported net interest margin was up 20 basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by day count, higher short-term interest rates and asset mix. Net interest margin was up 29 basis points on a year-over-year basis, primarily related to higher short-term interest rates and asset mix.","Turning to slide 5. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 10.7%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, it was 10.6%. Consistent with my past commentary, based on our current mix of business, we believe our CET1 ratio is around destination levels. Quarter-over-quarter, our CET1 ratio was flat as dividends, our organic growth and the closing of the Cabela's transaction essentially consumed the capital that was generated.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich. Rich?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Thanks, Scott. I'll begin on slide 9, which summarizes third quarter results for our domestic card business. On September 25, we completed the acquisition of the $5.7 billion Cabela's co-brand card portfolio. We're really excited to partner with Cabela's, a great retailer with a powerful brand and highly engaged and loyal customers.","Scott already discussed the third quarter impacts of the acquisition from allowance build and deal costs, which are included in our adjusting items for the quarter. We expect purchase accounting credit marks on the acquired loans to temporarily suppress the domestic card charge-off rate through November. We'll continue to break out the Cabela's impact in our monthly credit 8-Ks through the end of the year.","We also expect the addition of Cabela's to reduce the run rate of some of our domestic card metrics particularly delinquency rate, charge-off rate, and revenue margin going forward, all else equal. Compared to Capital One, the Cabela's portfolio has a lower margin and lower delinquency and charge-off rate, and our partnership includes a revenue and loss sharing agreement, which further impacts the metrics. Cabela's reduced our September domestic card delinquency rate by 21 basis points, and we expect the run rate reduction to be about 15 basis points.","Beginning in the fourth quarter, we expect Cabela's to reduce the domestic card revenue margin by about 65 basis points. And after the impacts of the purchase accounting credit marks subside, we expect that Cabela's will reduce the run rate domestic card charge-off rate by about 25 basis points beginning in December.","Turning to the third quarter results, ending loan balances were up $9 billion or about 10% compared to the third quarter of last year. Excluding Cabela's, ending loans grew $3.3 billion or 3.6%. Average loans were up 4%. Third quarter purchase volume increased 7.7% from the prior year. Excluding Cabela's, purchase volume increased 7.2%. Revenue for the quarter increased 5% from the prior year, largely in line with average loan growth. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.7%. Non-interest expense increased about 3% compared to the prior-year quarter.","The efficiency of our domestic card business continues to improve. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 4.64%, and the 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.94%. Excluding Cabela's, the charge-off rate would have been 4.66% and the 30-plus delinquency rate would have been 4.15%. We've been guiding to a range of high 4s to around 5% for full year 2017 domestic card charge-off rate. With nine months of actual results already booked, we expect to come in at the high end of the range, both excluding and including the expected impact of Cabela's. We expect that impact to be favorable to the 2017 full-year charge-off rate by single-digit basis points.","We expect the effects of growth math will continue to moderate with a small tail in 2018. As growth math runs its course, we believe that our delinquency and charge-off rate trends will be driven more by broader industry factors.","Slide 10 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans grew about 5% compared to the prior year. Auto loans were up about $7 billion, or 15% year-over-year. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage run-off. Ending deposits were up about 3% versus the prior year with a modest 6 basis point increase in deposit rate paid. Compared to the third quarter of 2016, auto originations were up 4% to $7 billion with balanced growth in prime, near prime, and subprime. As we discussed last quarter, competitive intensity in the auto finance marketplace remains a bit muted which continues to contribute to our growth.","While we still see attractive opportunities for future growth, there are also reasons for caution in the auto industry, including expected declines in auction prices and an increasingly indebted consumer. Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices, and we've dialed back on some less resilient programs even as overall originations have grown. As the cycle plays out, we continue to expect the charge-off rate will increase gradually and loan growth will moderate.","Consumer Banking revenue for quarter increased about 10% from the third quarter of last year, driven by growth in auto loans as well as deposit pricing and volumes. Non-interest expense for the quarter increased 2% compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans. Third quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year, primarily as the result of charge-offs and additions to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio.","Moving to slide 11. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances increased 2% year over year. Average loans increased 3% year-over-year. Higher average loans as well as higher non-interest income in our capital markets and agency businesses drove revenue growth of 4% compared to the third quarter of 2016. Non-interest expense was up 13%, primarily as the result of growth, technology investments and other business initiatives.","Provision for credit losses was $63 million, up $2 million from the third quarter of last year. Scott already discussed the third quarter charge-offs and allowance impacts from the taxi medallion portfolio. There were additional allowance releases related to the oil and gas and healthcare loan portfolios. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 96 basis points. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 4.3%, up 40 basis points from the second quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate was up 1.2% (sic) [was 1.2%] (14:16), up 20 basis points from the second quarter. Credit pressures continued to be focused in the taxi medallion and oil field services portfolios. We provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves and other metrics for these portfolios on slides 16 and 17.","Capital one continued to post year-over-year growth in loans, deposits, revenues and pre-provision earnings. We continued to tightly manage costs and improve efficiency, even as we invest to grow and drive our digital transformation. And we continued to carefully manage risk across all our Consumer and Commercial Banking businesses. We're planning to resubmit our CCAR capital plan by December 28, and we remain fully committed to addressing the Federal Reserve's concerns with our capital planning process in a timely manner.","We're affirming our 2017 guidance for domestic card charge-off rate, total company efficiency ratio and EPS growth. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we expect full-year 2017 domestic card charge-off rate to be at the high end of our range, with and without Cabela's. With nine months of actual results already booked, we expect 2017 total company efficiency ratio to come in at the low end of the 51s, net of adjustments. Over the longer term, we continue to believe we will be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement, driven by growth and digital productivity gains. And while the margin for error remains tight, we continue to expect 7% to 11% growth in EPS in 2017, net of adjusting items. Going forward, we expected to deliver solid EPS growth in 2018, net of adjustments, and assuming no substantial change in the broader credit or economic cycles.","Pulling up, the pace of the digital and technology transformation of the world is accelerating. The seismic changes in the marketplace are creating huge fault lines that will forever change banking, and create defining challenges and opportunities. We are well on our way to transforming our company to capitalize on these opportunities. We are rebuilding our infrastructure with a modern technology architecture, and changing the way we work. We're delivering great value to our customers with simple innovative products, caring service, and a compelling digital experience. We are driving resilient high-value growth, and we are improving efficiency. We continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive growth in returns, as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval.","Now, Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Appreciate all the disclosure. I guess, first question on future allowance builds. I guess, when we look ahead over the next year, should we assume that the provisions more closely are aligned to loan growth, but not for that small tail of growth math going forward?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Hey, Sanjay. Thanks for the question. We've been talking about the effect of growth math on the allowance for some time. And with growth math moderating, and having a tail in 2018, there are still some effects that are yet to come into the allowance, but beyond that, I would expect that we'll see the allowance being driven by the growth in the portfolio, as well as factors that should be impacting the broader industry.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And a follow-up just on the overall health of the consumer. I guess, Rich, you've talked about how the consumers have more choices in terms of leverage for the last year-and-a-half or so. But as we look at the underlying state of the consumer, do you feel like their ability and health has been fairly consistent, and not deteriorated much over that period of time? Thanks.","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah, Sanjay, I feel like we're kind of in the credit cycle, sort of middle of the cycle. And I mean, you can \u2013 there are things that are locally relevant about the Credit Card business that are different from the auto business, but kind of pulling way up on the consumer. While we're very obsessive about indebtedness and competitive intensity, I think that we're in a relatively stable part of the cycle. The economic indicators continue to look pretty benign. We saw trends actually flagging over the last year-and-a-half, with more alarmed trends in the auto and the Credit Card business related to \u2013 well, in the Credit Card, on the supply side; the auto, on the underlying side. But just going back to Credit Card, the surge of credit card supply in the second half of 2015 and especially in 2016, we were concerned by that, and especially, if you extrapolate that.","Since then, we've subsequently seen some pullbacks, which may be a response to the recent credit results of the card players. So, it feels like it's settled out a little bit and something that would be consistent more with the middle of the cycle; still moving forward as the cycle progresses there.","Then, you look on the supply side, mail volumes, marketing levels, new originations, they're still intense, but they're settling out I guess a little bit here. Then, we look at the revolving debt data from the Fed, and that's down a little bit to 5.8% growth year-over-year. Now, obviously, that's well above the rate of income growth, but at least within the sort of middle of the cycle you feel things a little bit more settling out. We can't help but point out, though, the sustained growth in the other non-mortgaged debts: student lending, auto lending, installment lending, which have recently been growing at about a 6% rate. But if you look at the total level of that debt, it's significantly above the pre-Great Recession peak. And that's especially true of student lending.","And then, the other factor on the consumer, of course, is the tremendously low sustained interest rates that they have enjoyed and, therefore, at this point, the debt servicing burdens and other measure of financial obligations are pretty stable, and they're lower than they were pre-Great Recession. So, if I pull way up on all of this, it feels kind of mid cycle. We spoke with a little more alarm over the 18 months and 12 months ago. But I think we'll obviously be very obsessive about this. But within this context, I think there are growth opportunities in our credit businesses.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, (23:00) please.","Operator","And we'll take your next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. A two-part question. Scott, Can you maybe expand on the comment you made about some of the pieces haven't made it into the allowance just yet? And then, second, most issuers have provided 2018 charge-off guidance. So can you maybe give us a sense where you think, assuming a stable environment, charge-offs would be? And if you're not going to give us a specific number, can you just talk about some of the puts and takes in terms of the impact of growth math, the impact of peaking of some of the vintages, and then everything else, including competition in the environment? Thanks.","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Ryan, on the allowance side, the allowance window is 12 months. We're sitting here at Q3, so we still got the fourth quarter of growth math in 2018 that we would expect will be impacting the allowance, so not more than just that.","And then, in terms of kind of where 2018 is headed, I'll turn that one over to Rich.","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yes. Hey, Ryan. On the \u2013 growth math has been the big story for Capital One for a long period of time. And it was \u2013 as a company that generally hasn't guided to credit loss numbers for the following year, we felt it was very important to step up and give guidance for the significant effects that were going to happen that we're going to be independent of the industry worsening or things like that. And the growth math is well on its way. You can see \u2013 I think September is a particularly strong month. But things bounce around for month to month. But you can see the growth math effects settling out. And as we said for a long time, we expect a small tail of growth math in 2018.","So, the other thing to watch, of course, is the back book, because by definition, in fact, when we speak about this, our front book is 2014 and on, and our back book is 2013 and before. And our back book, and I think this is very much an industry point, it's been a good guy for a long time, stable or improving \u2013 really, mostly improving for many years, recently, kind of stable. We have recently seen a little bit of uptick in back book charge-off rates, and I think this is an indication of some industry normalization.","If you look at the industry securitization trusts, which I know you do, Ryan, you can see this effect, you can see it in the Capital One securitization trust, you can see it in most of the other competitor trusts, particularly those that have not been added to recently. And I don't think that this is a different effect than all the things we talk about, about credit card industry moving to the middle of the cycle, but I think for all of us, we won't have the benefit of a tailwind from our back book anymore. And I think that \u2013 so, as we look forward about our own performance, growth math is going to be playing out, and we will be subject to the industry effects that will play out with others.","There's only a little qualifier I'd say on that, when we watch the credit performance of others, some who are in a higher growth period will have their own growth math effects playing out in their numbers, that may be company specific. But for us, I think our numbers will be driven by a growth math that is at the more advanced stages plus the overall industry effects.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Rich, you guys obviously worked pretty hard to get Cabela's done. I know it's possible, but there could be some large private label RFPs out there. Would you look at those, given Cabela's, and the sort of resubmission? What is your thought process there?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Well, I mean I think that those would be independent choices on the merits of whatever the opportunity is. So I do want to say, this has been a long journey to get to the finish line on Cabela's, and we're grateful to be in that position. I think it's a great business. We're really going to enjoy that. But, as you know, our considerations are always very deal specific. But I don't think the having of Cabela's, or the Cabela's journey affects our view about opportunities going forward. I think we'll take those on the merits of the particular case.","Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. Rich, with your (28:54) growth on the U.S. card business sort of slows to the 3% to 4% range, curious where you see the leverage in terms of that slower growth. Is it tighter underwriting? Is it reduced rewards? Is it reduced marketing and advertising? Where should we see the benefit of that come through, as you basically stop gaining so much market share?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Right, well, I mean, I don't speak of reduced growth so much in terms of, wow, we have reduced growth. I can't wait to take advantage of the benefits. I think there are things that happen when growth slows. The main thing I want to say is, we have capitalized with exceptional growth during a window, a kind of sweet spot in the competitive environment, and where the consumer was really where the whole industry was. That led to exceptional growth for several years.","And as you know, Rick, we don't set growth targets. We want our people to very much take the opportunity that the market gives them. And we've been saying for some time, we think it's a more kind of \u2013 maybe I'll describe it as a normal opportunity at the moment instead of the exceptional one that is there.","Now, the thing that took us from exceptional growth to sort of normal growth was a combination of a significant increase in the competitive environment. And then also in reaction to that, our own pullbacks around the edges, and it was just trimming around the edges and picking the stuff that I think had the most resilience and the best performance.","So, what will all that mean? I think that we feel very good about the value that's being created by the 2017 vintage. We think the growth opportunities continue on a pound per pound basis, the sort of NPV per account or any of these things to be at the high end of our experience. But the slowing of the growth also advances growth math toward its destination, where in 2018, there is a small tail, and then this thing is pretty much \u2013 at some point, actually, an important point, the growth math turns into a good guy, down the road, as it moves more and more toward a back book status, and enjoys the \u2013 some of the real payoff from all of this growth really comes in, if you call kind of Phase 1, the upfront and rapidly increasing losses, Phase 2, the sort of stable part where everything's settling out, and then Phase 3 is, all other things being equal, generally the steady gradual improvement of these vintages as they season. And I think that will be a good guy for the sustained earnings power from this surge of growth that we've had.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I agree with you. We think what you guys did was you made significant investments in 2015 and 2016 that are going to come to fruition. We're starting to see it now, we think it continues through 2018. But at the same time, it does appear that whereas you were growing probably 2x the industry 18 months ago, you're growing 75% of the industry today. And so beyond the seasoning that you're talking about, which again, is virtuous, I'm wondering if there are going to be other impacts we should be thinking about in terms of either tighter underwriting or lower expenses?","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Well, I mean, the expense story I think you've watched it play out, and we are continuing to drive efficiency both from growth and from, frankly, just good old-fashioned old-school squeezing out of and being very cost efficient, as well as what I might call new school efficiency, which is really related to leveraging \u2013 in many ways, transforming how we work, how we leverage technology for our customers and for our companies. So, those are certainly good guys over time.","Let me also just say one other thing about the industry growth and you may remember along the way I've been calling out from time to time, hey, we're in a period where there's \u2013 I remember in 2014, we said I just want to point out there's \u2013 we have an unusually high amount of line increases, because there had been some deferral of line increase in the couple of years prior to that. And so there's always kind of two growth stories that play out for any company.","And in many ways, one relates to potential energy and one is kinetic energy in the sense of physics. But we do all our marketing, and so much of the energy of the company goes into generating accounts. And then, there are choices about when we grow the lines on those accounts. And that creates a kind of a second wind of growth opportunity.","One of the things that has happened in Capital One for us over this last period of time is the actual growth machine of account origination has grown probably more than meets the eye. We continue to be pretty bullish, frankly, about the opportunity to continue to get accounts. And a lot of the, what we'd call trimming around the edges relates to let's just go a little slower, a little lower in terms of the line increases. Let's save some of that potential energy. But, partly, why you hear quite a bullishness in my voice is that the underlying marketing and origination and value creation machine at Capital One is going strong, and probably even higher than the, sort of, year-over-year growth numbers might indicate.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just follow up on that last point you were making about the potential energy. Should we think about your line increases as something where you apply sort of the same analytics, and run tests and experiments to see what sort of results you get with line increases? And do you use that potential energy as something that can stay in the bank for multiple years? Or is it something that deteriorates over time? Just curious how you think about it.","Richard D. Fairbank - Capital One Financial Corp.","Well, first of all, it's subject to all of the information-based strategy and massive, kind of, scientific testing that we have done for over two decades in building this company. The distinction that I would make, and I feel on a customer origination, a customer is right for an origination at a certain period of time, and if you don't get them at the right moment, you're probably not going to get that growth opportunity. When that customer is a customer, I think when you make the choices to increase line \u2013 I mean it's not like entirely just do it whenever it's right for us kind of thing, but it certainly is one that there's a lot more discretion, I think, and a lot more opportunity to feel the marketplace, really size up where we think the consumer is at the moment, and where adverse selection and various things are, and then make the choices.","But a very common thing that we do, when we see things and see risk, kind of, bubbling out there in the marketplace and competitive things going on, we often pull back on that form of energy a lot more than we pull back on the kinetic form. And that's partly when you see going on here. So, Capital One growth engine is continuing on pretty darn strong.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay, just to clarify with Scott, the 7% to 11% EPS growth, that includes the adjusting items, but not the notable items, correct?","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah. So, the 7% to 11% excludes adjusting items, but it includes the notable items. So it includes the effects of the hurricanes, and it includes the gains on the security sales.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Brendler with Buckingham.","Christopher Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good evening. I want to ask a question on the deposit side, just sort of blocking and tackling what you're seeing as rates rise, and maybe you could comment on deposit costs and trends within the three segments, being Consumer Bank, Commercial Bank, and Other. I guess I'm surprised, and should we be disappointed that the bank segments are shrinking and Other is rising? Or is that part of the strategy? Thank you.","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah. Chris, why don't I, kind of, give you just a general high-level overview of where we're thinking about deposit betas? Directionally speaking, we would expect or overall betas are going to be more or less in the higher end of regional banking peers, really because we've got a deposit mix that includes more savings and money markets than many of our peers. So we'll be a little bit on the higher end there.","But if you think about us just in total about \u2013 relative to the peers, most of our commercial deposits are operating accounts, and we have a smaller portion of commercial deposits than many of our peers. Our online deposits are typically have a relatively low average balance, so those are a little bit stickier than you might expect.","And then, when I look at our branches, the rates in our branches are already competitive with traditional bank branch players. And then, finally, we have a relatively low amount of non-interest-bearing DDA. So, when I look at all those moving pieces, our portfolio level beta has really more or less been in the middle of the pack. When I think about \u2013 brokered obviously has a very high beta, and we'll certainly see that impacting our overall cost of funding for the company. But from an overall perspective at this point in the rate cycle, betas for us have moved pretty modestly. We think we've picked up some of the benefits of that in our net interest margin, but I still think there's a ways to go yet, before betas start to be more responsive to additional rate moves.","Christopher Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And the segment question?","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","In terms of the segment, the brokered deposits are sitting over in our Other category. If you look across all of the segments, you see a pretty small amount of movement in rate paid in Consumer. Commercial has a larger move, which is not surprising. I think those are deposits that are a little bit more sensitive to rate moves. And then with brokered, those have very high betas, and so you've kind of seen those move proportionally with the market.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Thank you. Good evening. You reiterated your guidance for 7% to 11% EPS growth in 2017. And I know that you're not giving 2018 guidance, but intuitively, shouldn't there be an inflection in 2018 growth relative to 2017, given that the provision will grow \u2013 or should grow more in line with loans, all else equal? Just trying to make sure I understand the dynamics of the moving parts. I know there are a lot of moving parts, but just all else equal, the provision dynamic, if maybe you could speak to that, Rich and Scott.","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah, Bill, just remember, on provision, we still are talking about growth math in 2018. It's the tail of that, so we're starting to see the end of that effect. And so, on the one hand, you've got kind of the tail of growth math. We've got a little bit of the normalization of the back book that we're seeing through in the current quarter that's going to influence 2018.","And then, on the positive side, a little bit of opportunity in terms of on where we're going with efficiency. But that's \u2013 we've made lot of progress on efficiency. So to continue to make progress there is really going to be tough work, but we think we can grind some of that out. So, on balance, we've got pressures going in different directions still, and that kind of gets us to solid EPS in 2018.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Okay. Thank you. If I may, for Rich, Rich, you've talked about, on one hand, issues surrounding increases in the supply of credit, and also growth math. Could you perhaps comment on the interplay that you foresee in card between, on one hand, those normalization headwinds from growing supply, and the seasoning effect tailwinds from slower growth on the other?","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. I mean, I think the \u2013 let's talk about our front book and growth math. So, we're in the advanced stages of that journey. And I think relative to a lot of players whose growth has come more recently, we're in the more advanced stages of that. And so, I think we will \u2013 as we say, we still need \u2013 there is a small tail of growth math for 2018, but that is moving farther along, where it goes from being sort of a bad guy on the overall credit numbers, to, in the longer run, actually becoming a good guy. So that's a little bit more of a long-term effect, but we certainly look forward to that, and that's one of the \u2013 it is in that part of the cycle for \u2013 it's in that part of the life cycle of the vintage, where a lot of the value gets created.","And then, there's the back book which is going to move right along with the industry. I'd be very surprised if pretty much \u2013 all the seasoned back book of the competitors, I'd be surprised if they didn't pretty much move very closely together. We're not in the prediction business and I think we'll watch how those move. The only thing we did is just make note that, in recent months, there has been a bit of an uptick that you see across the industry. And again, I don't think it's surprising. I think what's been striking really about back books is they have been such a good guy for so long at some point. I think we're seeing natural industry cycle effects playing out there. So I think our biggest point is that the sort of unique story of Capital One and the growth math that was so intensely playing out because of the magnitude of our growth, I think relative to our seasoned books and relative to what the industry was doing, I think that's \u2013 it's mostly played its course.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks. Rich, clearly you're not tremendously concerned about the consumer. The auto business continues to grow quite nicely. And you talked about the origination machine on the card side being very strong. I guess what would it take for you to see in order for that to kind of trend upward again in terms of growth to a faster level, particularly given that, at least at this stage, the industry is growing somewhat faster, not a lot, but somewhat faster? I've got a follow-up also.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Moshe, Is that a credit card point?","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Credit card. Yeah, yeah, credit card, I'm sorry.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Credit card point, yeah. Well, see, in fact, it's interesting that you mentioned auto. You've known Capital One for a long period of time, and we read the marketplace, and then really seize opportunities when we see them. But a lot of times, we're near the top of the league tables or near the \u2013 sometimes we're near the bottom of the league tables of growth depending on the situation.","So, we're dialing back during the period of time over the last 18 months, when there was a surge in industry supply, there was a surge in growth of subprime supply in the industry where you started to see credit metrics coming in a little bit higher than expected. And that has mostly characterized the journey over the last 18 months. I did mention that, in response to some of these effects, it appears that the industry has dialed back a little bit. Several players have actually talked about dialing back. And, Moshe, that could open up more opportunities. We're not planning on it. We need to see validation before we do that. But I feel better about the industry and what it has to give us now than I did say a year ago when we were saying, boy, you look at second quarter 2016 for the whole industry, vintage curves were gapping out a little bit, and there were a lot of things bubbling that I think frankly have settled out a little bit between then and now.","So, we've got our underlying origination machine going. If we see more opportunity, we'll certainly take advantage of it, but we're not here to predict that. If you look at the auto business, Moshe, you have seen how much we have moved from capitalizing on a growth opportunity after the Great Recession \u2013 in the early stages in the wake of the Great Recession, growing at really pretty high rates for years. We started speaking alarm about underwriting practices, we pulled back quite a bit. Then the competitive situation softened and we really stepped into it, and leaned into it again, so we will always be very vocal about these opportunities. I think that paradoxically, while the actual growth numbers for Capital One are down, our bullishness about sort of the quality of the opportunity, and the bullishness that the card business is not sort of running away \u2013 the industry isn't running away with things is actually up a little bit.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Thanks. Just as a quick follow-up for Scott, you talked a little bit about deposit betas. We don't have the third quarter numbers yet, but back in the second quarter, your benefit from a rising rate environment kind of ticked down over the course of 2017. Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 because it seems to be that you're a little more \u2013 I don't know if it's more conservative or actually have a less beneficial outcome than some bank peers into a rising rate environment?","R. Scott Blackley - Capital One Financial Corp.","Yeah, I think, Moshe, if you looked at, as you obviously have, our rate risk disclosures, you can see that we're pretty close to flat against kind of where forwards are headed. And we are modestly and have been modestly asset sensitive for small changes in rates. We're more liability sensitive for larger changes in rates, but we certainly aren't trying to place a bet on where rates are moving. We're trying to be pretty neutral to where forwards are headed.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Next question, please.","Operator","And our final question tonight comes with Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hello? Hi. Two questions. One, just on the mix of the portfolio with the above and below 660. Obviously, you put that in your deck. Just wanted to get a sense as to when you're thinking about portfolios, does it matter to you whether or not that portfolio would come in and skew the split you have here of above and below 660, the 65\/35 that you have this quarter, or if you'd be willing to let that skew change in any material way?","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, Betsy, we would take that one case \u2013 one opportunity at a time. As a general observation from years of doing this, when we have looked at subprime skewed portfolios, in the card business, we have tended not to be comfortable with the risk, and especially, the amount of credit line that has been extended to so many customers. Cabela's interestingly, obviously is an acquisition at the top of the market. It did move the metrics of our mix, but we just really liked that particular opportunity and we went for it on its own metrics. But I think over time, it is more likely that you'll see Capital One in pursuit of higher end opportunities than lower end opportunities just because of the two decades of experience we have in the sort of upper end of subprime. And we're very familiar with the many dangers that can come when folks haven't underwritten it conservatively enough.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, no, that's helpful. And then, my follow-up was just on how you're thinking about the benefit of the digitization on expense ratio over time. I'm not asking for what 2018's going to be but as you think more on a three to five year kind of timeframe, do you feel that the investment spend that you're making today is something that could materially move the expense ratio from here? Or it's more likely to be a grind, grind, grind? I guess my question is, is there a step function you see coming? Or are we grinding our way through to better efficiencies over time?","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, I'm a big believer that investment in technology ends up being a good guy. Well, it doesn't happen automatically. But investment in technology the way that we're doing it by not just putting a piece of technology in or not just building an app, or some customer-facing thing, but really focusing on transforming from the bottom of the technology stack up. Our foundational technology, and also leveraging that to transform how we work, I think that's going to be a significant good guy way down the road.","On the way to that journey is a lot of technology investments. So, as you may recall, Betsy, over the last number of years, we've been saying, look, we're investing a lot in technology, and there are two meters that are running. One is the increase in investment in technology itself, which has been significant over that period of time. And another meter is, the cumulative run rate benefits that we also are now starting to generate from that technology investment, combined with really proactively transforming how we work.","The nice thing is, I think that second meter of the cumulative benefits, that's a meter that will keep growing. I just want to say along the way, we continue to invest in technology a lot. I don't think a day will come when we say we have arrived. We're not going to keep investing in technology. But what happens is, the second meter, the benefits of this are going to just keep increasing over time. And so, I think it is a contributor to long-term better efficiency for the company. There's no moment of \u2013 there's not, like, in our near future, a step change in economics. But one thing that I think we're very focused on at Capital One is, and a very critical way that investors will get paid is through improving efficiency. And to do that, both through the old school techniques of just really trying to manage tightly, but then really getting so much of the opportunity from the transformational opportunities that technology gives, that's what this journey is about. It's a long-term journey, but I think you can already start to see the benefits. And I think you will gradually see more and more of them over time.","Jeff Norris - Capital One Financial Corp.","Thanks, Rich. Thank you, Scott.

And if you want to access the call via the internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there.","In addition to the press release and financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2017 results.","With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Scott Blackley, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Scott will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, and then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements.

Rich?","Richard Fairbank","Thanks, Jeff and good evening everyone. Capital One earned just over $1 billion or $1.94 per share, in the second quarter. Pre-provision earnings for the quarter were $3.3 billion and we continued to deliver year-over-year loan and revenue growth across our businesses. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to expect domestic charge-off rate for full-year 2017 to be in the high 4s to around 5.","We continue to expect full-year efficiency ratio for the total company to be in the 51 net of adjusting items and plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility and while the margin for error remains tight based on what we see today, we remain well positioned to deliver 7% to 11% growth in EPS in 2017 net of adjusting items.","All of our guidance excludes the potential impact of the Cabela's transaction.","Now I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss second quarter results for the company. Scott?","Scott Blackley","Thanks Rich. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $1 billion or $1.94 per share in the second quarter. In the quarter, we recognized $12 million of non-interest expenses related to our anticipated close of the Cabela's transaction. Excluding these costs, earnings per share was $1.96. We will continue to break out future deal and integration costs as well as the initial allowance build associated with the onboarding of the Cabela's assets. The closing of this transaction is still pending regulatory approval.","Pre-provision earnings increased 6% on the linked quarter basis as we recognized higher revenues and lower non-interest expenses.","Provision for credit losses decreased 10% on a linked quarter basis as higher charge-offs primarily in our commercial banking business were more than offset by lower linked quarter allowance builds. We have provided an allowance roll-forward by business segment which can be found on Table 8 of our earnings supplement.","Let me take a moment to explain the movements in our allowance across our businesses. In our domestic card business, we built $155 million of allowance in the quarter, two primary factors drove that build balanced growth in the quarter and our expectation of rising charge-offs.","Allowance on our consumer banking segment increased by $36 million in the quarter. This increase was attributable to our auto business where we build allowance for new origination. In the second quarter, we had about a 40 basis point impact to our auto charge-off rate from the initial effective accounting changes and the timing of charge-offs which I've discussed over the last couple of quarters in our calls.","Beginning in the third quarter and continuing throughout 2018, we expect these accounting changes to increase annualized charge-off rates by 15 to 20 basis points after which the effect begins to reverse overtime.","Lastly, we had a $4 million release in reserves on our commercial banking segment as we released reserves associated with loans that moved to charge-offs which was partially offset by reserve builds primarily focused in our taxi medallion business.","Turning to Slide 4, you can see that reported net interest margin was flat for the first quarter at 6.9%, and it was up 15 basis points on a year-over-year basis fueled by strong growth in our domestic card business and higher rates.","Turning to Slide 5, I'll discuss capital. As previously announced following the Federal Reserve's conditional non-objection to our 2017 CCAR plan, our Board has authorized repurchases of up to 1.85 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2018, and we expect to maintain our quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share which is subject to Board approval.","Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 10.7% which reflects current phase-in. On a standardized fully phased-in basis it was 10.6% and with that I'll turn the call back over to Rich.","Richard Fairbank","Thanks, Scott. I will begin on Slide 9 with second quarter results for our domestic card business. Loan growth and purchase volume growth decelerated in the quarter but remained strong. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our ending loans grew $4.3 billion or about 5%. Average loans were up $5.8 billion or about 7%.","Second quarter purchase volume increased about 7% from the prior year. Revenue for the quarter increased 7% from the prior year in line with average loan growth. Revenue margin for the quarter was 16.6%.","Non-interest expense increased about 3% compared to the prior year quarter.","Our domestic card business continues to gain scale and improved efficiency. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.11% and the 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.63%. Both metrics were down a few basis points from the sequential quarter compared to the second quarter of last year both metrics were higher as expected.","The impact of growth math remains largely in line with our expectation. As a reminder, growth math is defined as the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances in our front book season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio relative to the older and highly seasoned back book. We continue to expect the impact of growth math will moderate in the second half of 2017 with a small tail beyond 2017. As growth math runs its course, we believe that our delinquency and charge-off rate trends will be driven more by broader industry factors.","Slide 10 summarizes second quarter results for our consumer banking business. Ending loans grew about 5% year-over-year. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff. Ending deposits were up about 6% year-over-year with a four basis point increase in deposit rate paid.","Compared to the second quarter of 2016, auto originations were up 14% to $7.5 billion with strong growth in prime, near prime, and sub-prime. As we discussed last quarter, competitive intensity in the auto finance marketplace remains a bit muted which continues to contribute to our growth. While we still see attractive opportunities for future growth, there are also reasons for caution in the auto industry including expected declines in auction prices and an increasingly indebted consumer.","Our underwriting assumes a decline in used car prices and we've dialed back on some less resilient programs even as our overall originations have grown. As the cycle plays out, we continue to expect the charge-off rate will increase gradually and that growth will moderate.","Consumer banking revenue for the quarter increased about 9% from the second quarter of last year driven by growth in auto loans as well as deposit pricing and volumes.","Non-interest expense for the quarter increased 5% compared to the prior year quarter driven by growth in auto loans and an increase in marketing.","Second quarter provision for credit losses was up from the prior year primarily as the result of charge-offs and additions to the allowance for loan losses for the auto portfolio.","Moving to Slide 11, I'll discuss our commercial banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances increased 2% year-over-year and average loans increased 4%. Higher average loans as well as higher non-interest income in our capital markets and agency businesses drove revenue growth of 9% compared to the second quarter of 2016.","Non-interest expense was up 11% primarily as the result of growth technology investments and other business initiatives.","Provision for credit losses increased from the second quarter of last year driven by charge-offs in the oilfield services and taxi medallion portfolios. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 80 basis points. Criticized in non-performing loans rates were relatively stable in the quarter. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.9% and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 1.0%.","Credit pressures continue to be focused in the oilfield services and taxi medallion portfolios. We've provided summaries of loans, exposures, reserves, and other metrics for these portfolios on Slide 16 and 17.","I will close tonight with a summary of key second quarter themes. Capital One continued to post solid year-over-year growth in loans, deposits, revenues, and pre-provision earnings. We continued to tightly manage costs and improve efficiencies even as we invest to grow and drive our digital transformation and we continued to carefully manage risk across all our consumer and commercial banking businesses.","Based on what we see today, we are affirming our guidance for full-year 2017 domestic card charge-off rate, total company efficiency ratio and growth in EPS. All of our guidance is net of adjusting items and the potential impact of Cabela's.","As Scott mentioned, the Federal Reserve completed its CCAR process in the quarter. Our capital plan received a conditional non-objection which requires us to resubmit a revised capital plan by December 28. We will resubmit our capital plan and are fully committed to addressing the Federal Reserve's concerns with our capital planning process in a timely manner.","Pulling up, we continue to be struck by the amount of change that's coming in the marketplace and the opportunity to capitalize on that. We have invested heavily in transforming our company and driving growth opportunities. We are well on our way to rebuilding our infrastructure with a modern technology architecture and along the way we are redesigning how we work. We are delivering resilient growth across our businesses. We are driving improving efficiency and we are building an enduring customer franchise. We continue to be in a strong position to deliver attractive growth and return as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.","Now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts, who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up and if you have follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Liane, please start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","We will take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Good evening. Just wanted to ask about the vintages that you're seeing in the loss trends within the card vintages. I know you had indicated last quarter that your updated charge-off expectations incorporate your expectation for losses in the 2016 vintage to be on par with 2015, is that still the case or are you seeing any changes there? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","Hey John, our expectations are the same 2016 vintage on par with 2015 vintage.","Jeff Norris","Your follow-up.","John Pancari","Okay all right, thanks. Yes a follow-up to that was just on the auto front. I know you had indicated that you do expect charge-offs in the auto book to increase moderately over time just consistent with the general pressure you're seeing in the business. Can you just help quantify the piece or just help quantify that what you mean by moderately there and then also are you providing at a higher level at this point given the worsening severities as used car values have pulled back?","Scott Blackley","John why don't I start on the back end of that question and turn it over to Rich. So in terms of our allowance process we've been assuming kind of used car prices to fall and it continued to fall. So we've already been building that into our allowance and I think that that's something that we would expect to continue.","Richard Fairbank","John relative to the charge-off outlook, you could go back and it's probably for the last three years I've been saying that we expect charge-offs to gradually increase in the auto business and we're saying it again. Now and the reason for that is the same reason that that's driven this conversation over these years which is off of an exceptionally low base of charge-offs that the phenomenon of normalization we have fully expected.","Now the interesting thing is Capital One's charge-offs that we have posted over time in general haven't gone up in that way and there's been a couple of things going on there, the biggest thing has been sort of a gradual mix shift, up market in that sense the particularly the higher growth that we've gotten at the higher end of the market has sort of offset that effect but beneath it all, if we look at the things like the sub-prime business there. There has been some gradual normalization going on it's a natural phenomenon. Probably all in all, the amount of normalization has not been as high as we have ourselves internally forecasted because we've been pretty cautious about what we expect with respect to new used car prices and frankly some of the competitive dynamics in the auto business I think have kind of helped in competitive meaning the easing of some of the competition particularly on the sub-prime side I think has eased things.","So if we look in hindsight at this, three or four year period while we've been raising our estimates for losses, we think there's been a lot of value creation, there's good opportunities for growth. The business is in bit of an odd place with some easing competitive intensity but still the other dynamics that are associated with increasing potential for risk things like used cars but all in all, it's -- there's a good opportunity right now but I think you should expect losses will gradually go up over time.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Jeff Norris","Are you there Ryan? Ryan may be you come back. Let's go to the next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Rich, you talked a little about credit in the credit card business. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment from a growth perspective I mean we've seen a little -- a number the large banks are starting to actually show some growth acceleration and so what are you kind of looking at that's different and kind of how do you see that playing out over the next year?","Richard Fairbank","Yes, I mean Moshe we first of all we believe the opportunity to grow continues in the card business. What I would say is the exceptional opportunity has mostly run its course and now there's a more just there is just a good opportunity let's talk about the exceptional opportunity for a second while a lot of people were not -- they weren't as heavily marketing and not as seeing the growth opportunity that we saw, we pretty much captured several years of outsized growth and I think that it served us very well even though we all know of course the upfront costs of that in terms of credit and allowance have been little rough on the P&L.","What I think has happened over time, the competition has definitely intensified but it's not irrational. So let\u2019s talk about it at a couple of levels. First of all at the where it's most -- where it's competition is most obvious to everyone who has like a television or anything else is in the reward space and it is very clear that marketing levels are up, rewards, rewards levels on various cards are up, we've not only seen several players come forward with higher, higher things like cash card rates. One of the striking things to me is what's happening on the co-brand side in the process of the renewal of Co-brand deals, there has been a pretty significant cranking up of some of the rewards associated with those.","The other striking thing happening Moshe on the competitive front at the top of the market is the early bonus the giveaways associated with that. Now we that particular area we worry a lot about and we pretty much live inside the frontier of those early bonuses only because we have so much experience over the last 20 years on what happens when you get the Hoppers, the Teaser Hoppers, the Bonus Hoppers the various folks there. So I think we all have to keep an eye on what happens there, so it is clear that that the table stakes are higher, the investment is higher and the competition is higher at the top of the market going after rewards.","That said we continue to be very pleased with our performance there and we continue to -- continue to winning in that space is about sustaining investment and about winning in product, marketing, service, digital experience brand there's a lot to that but we very much note the competition but we were all in and we still like very much what's going on.","The other thing I would comment though is about more the revolver side of the marketplace. I think people are you are seeing more growth there but I'd put it in the rationale category, we don't see really anything going on about pricing in that marketplace; we don't see underwriting standards being compromised. So I think it is that the more kind of normal phase in a market which is just people stepping up and investing more and trying to grow more.","So in the context of all of that, I think it's still a reasonably healthy card marketplace, the growth opportunity we had before is not quite what it was but we still we still like the opportunity.","Jeff Norris","And do you have a follow-up, Moshe?","Moshe Orenbuch","Yes if you just kind of extend some of that to auto, you mentioned there is some easing in the sub-prime, are you tilting more in direction or more in the prime in that business at this point?","Richard Fairbank","Well I think we're pursuing the same strategy that we probably a big word for this the same -- the same approach and underwriting standards pretty much consistently across from the top of the market through near prime and into the part of subprime that we play as well. The point I would make is that the competitive easing is more in the near prime and prime part of the marketplace. So that therefore the opportunity for growth is a little higher there. So it's in a sense same approach same strategy, same underwriting but a little bit different market dynamics depending on which part of the market we're talking about.","Jeff Norris","Next question please?","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Do you hear me this time?","Jeff Norris","We got you, Ryan.","Ryan Nash","Okay. Sorry about that. I was having headset problems. A question for Scott. Scott, you noted that the card reserve build was for both growth and the expectation for higher charges which I'm assuming you're trying to imply 2Q 2018 charges would be above 2Q 2017 but just given what we -- everything you're seeing competition vintages what you're seeing in terms of your delinquency improvement I guess there was no change in the macro or the competitive environment. Any sense about how you would think about charge-offs for 2018 and\/or when would you actually expect to see charge-offs begin to level off on a year-over-year basis?","Scott Blackley","Yes, Ryan, thanks for the question. Look as we said last quarter, we thought that Q1 was the high point for reserve build in the domestic card portfolio as growth math is starting to moderate in through the back end of 2017 with the tail after 2017. The effective growth math on the allowance is no longer going to be the biggest driving factor and that's been over the last couple of years that's been the really big driver.","So what I would say with the allowances as we move through 2017 increasingly, the allowance is not going to be really driven by kind of that upward pressure of growth math that we've been talking about but it's really going to be driven by more just the overall industry factors and where those go, I think is it's something that we'll be talking about going forward but I don't have a forecast for you for 2018.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And then maybe if I could just ask one quick follow-up Rich when you reiterated the EPS guidance 7% to 11%, you noted again that the margin there remained tight. Can you maybe just give us a sense of your confidence of hitting the target and what are the key swing factors at this point in time just in terms of being bottom of the range versus top of the range?","Richard Fairbank","So yes thanks Ryan. Look I want to start by saying that I stepped out of my character and you might have wondered what happened to Rich Fairbank that you knew because I haven't you'd have to go way back a lot of -- a lot of years ago to where we have given EPS guidance because kind of to your point, I mean this is in the end the difference of large numbers and it's subject to very big swings associated with allowance and other things that can happen. So we generally and I want to make sure people know that I'm generally don't plan to be in the EPS guidance business.","The reason that we kind of stepped out and did that last quarter was really more to show the market that while there's a lot of noise associated with some of these credit numbers, our story is our belief and growth math that the belief in what we could do on the efficiency ratio side, the momentum of the company, and our ability to successfully get there, I think we felt pretty confident about that but again we cautioned of course and to your point it's a pretty small range.","So what is the biggest drivers of that? I mean the biggest driver still always is credit and in a world where everything's on balance sheet and small changes in expectations lead to you know this into the whopping allowance effect that is certainly something that is a probably at the top of the list for the biggest effect. On that one we feel good about the trajectory of growth math but we know that small, small changes can have effect. So we're certainly aware of that.","I think that is the big one I think beyond that, the -- I think the trajectory of our spending on things like marketing, the seizing of growth opportunities, the timing of progress on our continuing quest for efficiency will also be factors that play into this and the other thing I would say of course that rates, interest rates they can always play a factor. But that's just a little window into our own dialogue with ourselves about this but when we look at those things while there is always risk associated with the guidance like this, we feel, we like our chances, we like our momentum here, and we continue to maintain that guidance.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.","David Ho","Good evening. Just wanted to circle back on underwriting standards that you may have tightened over the past year and large part trying to get those vintages to perform in line with expectations. Have you seen or have you done an additional tightening for 2017 vintages are you comfortable in your underwriting standards there? Obviously it's hard to track FICO but, in terms of the mix how does that stabilize as well?","Richard Fairbank","Yes, David, we one thing is of course this is hundreds of programs we're talking about and changes that we constantly do around the edges. But to generalize it was around the beginning of 2016 that we started tightening around the edges and we talked about that and it is that tightening that had led us to be pretty confident that in fact 2016 vintage was going to come in better than 2015. You may recall that we had talked about that and certainly had early indications consistent with that. Some of the slippage in the marketplace and relative to our expectations there was kind of -- we\u2019re now more these are more on par with each other.","Over the course of this journey, watching the marketplace, the competitive environment, the greater supply, and continuing to look at all of our programs and where credit was coming in, to your question, we have continued to tighten a bit around the edges and important, but not only but probably the majority contributor to our reduced growth is just our continued tightening and particularly the tightening that's going on is less around the origination side and more about the timing, just the size of lines and the timing of line increases under the philosophy let's continue to really book the customers, take advantage of the window of opportunity.","In our own time, we can choose when and how much to extend the credit lines that's more of a kind of stored energy that we get there. So and by the way in the marketplace is no doubt the marketplace become more competitive, so that's also contributed to our slowdown as well. But all of that said I think that we have high expectations for 2017 coming in as a very strong vintage.","David Ho","Right. As a follow-up what kind of card growth year-over-year are you comfortable with while still maintaining your 2017 guide and obviously your the outlook for 2018 in terms of growth math diminishing, is it more in line with industry growth how do you think about kind of the range there versus the kind of the industry average growth year-over-year?","Richard Fairbank","Well we're specifically not giving guidance year-over-year for card growth but I think you're asking what card growth, do we need to kind of be able to maintain our EPS guidance was that were you linking those two.","David Ho","Yes.","Richard Fairbank","Well because the reason I say that is the amount of card growth is look I think at this point for the rest of the year the amount of card growth is not that bigger driver on the EPS, it will have quite a bit of impact on next year's EPS and other things. But across the reasonable range of card growth that we would look at for the rest of the year, anything in that range probably wouldn't have that much impact on the EPS. Relative to next year's card growth we're not going to give guidance on that but I want to come back to my point that we're -- we continue to be all-in in terms of capitalizing on growth opportunities that are out there, they've gone from -- the growth opportunities have gone from exceptional to good.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Steven Kwok","Hi this is Steven actually filling in for Sanjay. Just wanted to see if you can elaborate around the issues that's pointed out in the CCAR planning process and how comfortable should we be that the problem will be remediated?","Scott Blackley","Yes, hey thanks for asking the question and as you might expect, we're not really in a position to talk about kind of the Fed process around CCAR, that's all guarded by confidential supervisor information that we're not have liberty to disclose, so the things that I can tell you if you want to have the most that we can tell you is really to point you to the Fed CCAR report and they're going to give you the best description of kind of the issues that they thought that there were. I will only just reiterate the point that Rich made which is we are fully committed to meeting the requirements and resubmitting our capital plan within the timeframes that the Fed has established for us.","Steven Kwok","Got it. And then the follow-up question is just around the sub-prime consumer behavior, have you guys seen any changes around the behavior of them?","Richard Fairbank","I would say generally no. I -- we certainly note that the growth in revolving debt in sub-prime is higher than that in prime. By the way the last few months that's kind of settled down a little bit but it's still higher than prime. So we certainly have our eye on that. Of course that is also in the context of coming off of a base of a pretty big retraction -- retrenchment since the Great Recession.","So we will keep an eye on the data about the consumer I mean the economic -- economy metrics. But beyond that we have not seen a lot of behavioral change, we have talked in prior conversations about the fact that there is some normalization generally going on that can have some in second quarter of 2016, we saw some as an industry effect not just the Capital One effect a little gapping out of some vintage performance that that all would be consistent with the marketplace moving along and getting a little more competitive and consumers getting a little bit more indebted. But beyond that, we haven't seen anything unique to the sub-prime space and that's why our strategy pretty much continues we've just been a little cautious around the edges.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Two questions one on how you were thinking about recoveries. We heard from some others recently that there's some pressure on pricing in recoveries and I know you're not using third parties as much as some other folks or may be if you can give us a sense to what you're seeing in the marketplace and how you anticipate that impacting you?","Richard Fairbank","Betsy, yes, we don't sell as much of our charge-off debt as other people do but we still do participate in that market. But just pulling up overall on recoveries it's interesting recovery we always tend to look at that independently of other metrics but I've certainly seen over the years how recoveries move in tandem with a lot of other dynamics going on. So for example in this journey that we've talked about of the industry credit normalization some of the things were even our own expectations about credit performance we've found things were came in a little higher than, than we had expected.","Recoveries was right in there as one of the little culprits in that. So we have seen generally some softening of recovery rates beginning in the third quarter of 2016 which continued into early 2017 they were stable in the second quarter but we'll have to keep an eye on recoveries and in many ways I think they will go in many ways as the overall credit market place goes.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, thanks. And then the follow-up just on the tax exposure right now you provided us just a spreadsheet showing us the exposure but wanted to understand how you're thinking about that in particular given that the criticized performing loan rate increased quite a bit in the quarter does that suggest that you were preparing to just build the reserve further as, as time goes on here?","Scott Blackley","Yes, hey Betsy it's Scott thanks for the question. So a couple of thoughts here first of all as, we've been disclosing the details about the taxi portfolio for a few years because it's been an area that we want to make sure that our investors and others had a good insight into what our exposures where they're that\u2019s on Slide 17 in the material.","We've got about 580 million of taxi medallions on the balance sheet as of June 30, 17% allowance coverage ratio so well provided for their. Of that around 530 million is New York City taxi medallions and I think that, at this point, it's well understood that with the arrival of Uber and other competition that there's a lot of pressure in the value of these medallions and we've been seeing that pressure actually in revenues and in cash flows for several years.","And as a consequence of that we've actually been carrying and writing down our loans to the lower fair value or carrying value for several years. So we've -- we're kind of well on our journey to making sure that we keep these loans marked at market prices. In Q2 we had a total provision of expense on taxi around 55 million which was primarily charge-offs but we also build allowance which was all based on kind of our view of the changes in the value of medallions that happened in the quarter.","I will tell you that I've read the comments from other banks that have come out recently I feel very comfortable with our marks and where we are on our portfolio and I just say kind of in terms of what we might see going forward, right now, we're working aggressively with our borrowers to restructure loans where possible we're taking steps to make sure that we're protecting our collateral. I think the allowance and our charge-off levels are indicative of kind of where prices are today but there's certainly a risk that if this market doesn't stabilize that we could be subject to further write-downs if we see, kind of fair values and prices drift further south.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Can you remind us what percentage of the cards within your partnership business or store only versus also general purpose cards that have a Visa, Master Card logo on them? And can be used for out of store spend and then are you seeing any kind of difference in customer payment behavior between the cards that are good at the partner store only versus the cards that can be used for general purpose spending.","Scott Blackley","Hey Bill this is Scott we don't -- we don't actually breakdown in any detail kind of the partnership from our broader card portfolio that's not information that we're going to be able to provide you.","Bill Carcache","Okay, I guess may be perhaps just if you could comment at a high level from your experience whether there's any customer kind of taking order preference for you know whether they're going to pay that private label store card first versus the general purpose card if you can any color on that at a high level would be helpful.","Richard Fairbank","Bill -- I, we were not in the great recession; we were not big players in the partnership business. We did an acquisition since then but of course we couldn't resist but peek back and see what we could observe of in the Great Recession and under stress. I carry around an intuitive view and I certainly have not seen anything to inconsistent with this that in general the -- these co-brand cards, a defining thing that I would put on the co-brand cards that have a lot of out of stores spend and become like a primary spending vehicle. These things are top of the line and I think that that we would believe that they would lead the league tables in terms of resilience.","We've all had a lot of conversation both in our partnership business and frankly across our whole commercial business about the woes of retail and what does that mean and I think that if you look back at the Great Recession I think that the private label card did seem to get hit harder. But one thing I would say in their defense is you move from a position of sharing economics to having the entire economics and I still think most people are motivated by the desire to payoff and keep a good credit record.","So look I carry around the intuitive belief that our private label business probably runs a little bit more risk than that -- than the high end co-brand programs but that I haven't seen anything to cause us to say that I feel I think we still believe in these programs you're going to get the vast majority of customers to repay but it certainly is a risk.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.","Chris Donat","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to shift a little bit to expenses first with marketing Richard you talked about going from an exceptionally good opportunity -- an exceptional opportunity to just a good opportunity should we expect you to continue with sort of this level of marketing spend or does it get harder to attract the customers you want now that you're no longer in the exceptional opportunity for U.S card.","Richard Fairbank","Yes, well so a bunch of things to say to that great question. First of all notice what we said that our dialing back in many ways is the dialing back of growth the slowing of growth is in many ways driven by more conservative choices about the timing and magnitude of line increases, how much credit line is granted at the outset those kind of things none of which really have anything to do with marketing. So, we continue to be all in on the origination of accounts and I don't -- I don't see any change in that and even by the way in dialing around the edges, dialing around the edges, those edges tend to be around approvals in the context of the same marketing it's just when we get hundred customers in there, there might be a few more percent that that might not make it through the -- the filter kind of thing. So that that is kind of point number one so, so what of which is our quest for pretty sizable growth of accounts continues and we feel pretty bullish about the prospects.","The other thing is and other thing that I've learned over the years of being in this business. There is some investors feel like okay well there's going to be less growth therefore you don't have to spend money on marketing usually it almost works sometimes the other way because other people step up the table stake go up. And unless we really say okay in a particular segment, we're just not going to compete, it sort of have to pay more to get to stay to stay in place kind of thing. Now there comes a point where things get so irrational we have from time to time just pulled out of things but my point about the card business I still would call it more, it's just something that's more competitive but generally rationale.","So we -- I think our investors should carry around the assumption that we're going to continue to be aggressive in our marketing and I think it's while the marketing efficiency is compared with the last couple of years, last two or three years that have been in the exceptional category, marketing efficiency is little more in the \"normal category\" but we're still all in on this marketing and I think that will continue.","Chris Donat","Okay. Thanks for that and then just a follow-up quickly with Scott on the salaries were down $88 million quarter-on-quarter was there anything elevated either in the first quarter or unusual in the second quarter?","Scott Blackley","Yes, in the first quarter we had a lot of just kind of the normal taxes and such that happens in the first quarter where that starts to run out into the second quarter, so that it doesn't carry through. So nothing unusual there and is more or less consistent with kind of the seasonal trends.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","Hey guys thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Look we've had a interesting discussion about the impact of ride share on taxi medallion prices. How do you manage risk in the auto portfolio from ride share you\u2019re probably in the next year or two start to get back a lot of cars with a ton of miles on them. And I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s something you're thinking about in terms of risks or how you sort of account for that in terms of underwriting?","Richard Fairbank","Rick, look I think you make a good point I think the -- I think there are a number of factors that while I must admit, I don't think we have put a real focus on I don't remember being in a meeting where we're talking about your specific point. I think if you pull up and think about the auto business and some of the longer-term issues all the pressure from the tech companies on the things like the ride sharing, you\u2019re talking about even looking further down the pike at what would be the impact of all the technology changes in automobiles and in the limit the driverless cars.","But even on that, even before the day finally comes when we down the road we're all doing our work in the back seat and there is no driver long before that I think we all have to be very vigilant about what is the impact of technology change is there come to be I mean generally the quality of technology has sometimes allowed cars to last longer and has been a good guy in the auto business. But the question is will there be a tipping point where the old cars just don't cut it and the new ones are so much better.","So this in fact I just want to pause for a second and just kind of seize the moment that one of the -- one of the things that I don't I think banks don't do that well I think Capital One did not do that well on things like Uber story is pull way up across all of our lending businesses and ask what is the impact given that industry after industry is being revolutionized, what is the impact especially I think in the commercial C&I business of the revolution that's going on in our clients' businesses and if we just go and make one loan at a time and do our nice underwriting standards we could wake up and have a lot of rude surprises like we did in the taxi kind of business.","So I don't have a great answer for your specific question but one of the things that we put a lot of energy into Capital One is pulling way up and instituting not only I mean the conversation but instituting a kind of risk management process associated with the extraordinary revolution that's happening in our industries, in our clients' industries, and in some of our core businesses it's a great challenge.","Scott Blackley","Rick, one other thing I would just mention we definitely in part of our underwriting practice in assuming that auction prices continue to fall is taking into account the longer lives of cars that our allowance is only 12 months, so it certainly isn't going to capture the shift in that you're talking about in terms of ride share. But part of the reason why we continue to really pay close attention to auction prices is there's a variety of risk that can impact that over time and when we're originating these loans, we're thinking about kind of all those risks as we do that which is a reason why we continue to plan for auction prices to move lower from here.","Rick Shane","Got it. And again my point is not are there going to be fewer cars on the road because we use them more densely or is there going to be a technology shift that basically makes old cars obsolete? I'm actually thinking about the more immediate which is that I'm assuming of a fair number of customers who are taking loans from you guys with the idea that they might be in the ride share business and if the economics don't work out for them, those are cars that are very, very likely to come back and have very high mileage and I'm curious if one of the things that we're seeing against you guys or so quantitative, if we're seeing higher mileage on the repos that are coming back in?","Scott Blackley","That I don't at the top of my head, I can\u2019t I actually can\u2019t give you an answer to that one, I can do some follow-up we can circle back with you but Rick overall we're taking into account all of those statistics and formulating kind of our expectations around auction prices and resale values. So I think that's kind of embedded in our assumption.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran","Hi, I\u2019ve got one question on fees and on technology and digitalization? On fees, it\u2019s a pretty strong quarter and in particular service charges have been a drag for a long time that are now up year-over-year and Interchange revenues up a little faster than spend volume. Can you maybe just describe is this any kind of inflection point or is it more quarter-to-quarter noise just fees actually was a pleasant surprise this quarter to kind of figure out what drove that?","Scott Blackley","Yes, thanks Brian for the question. Non-interest income was up about 16% in the quarter. And there's a few things that are going on there, non-interest income per share is lumpier than net-interest income. It certainly doesn't move quite as consistently with loan volumes and so I just kind of go through and talk about a few of the drivers.","So you're right that net Interchange was a large driver that contribute about $100 million in the quarter-over-quarter variance and if you think there we have the higher seasonal purchase volume which was favorable and then as usual we have kind of the normally quarterly adjustments to rewards liability expense those kinds of things that run-through there and can create some quarter-over-quarter volatility and we saw that this quarter.","We also in the first quarter had some UKPPI expense that ramped through there, so that created just under $40 million of favorability when we look at the linked quarter and then kind of I just kind of also point out that in our commercial business that business has some lumpy fees that come in and we did see around $25 million of higher quarter-over-quarter fees. Those are businesses that that have a business model where they generate fees and normally we see them kind of a little bit there are some puts and takes at this quarter they just happened all kind of worked in our favor and so they all came in a positive way. But that's kind of the overall picture, I think they're all part of our business model but I would say that we would expect that that line item is going to continue to be a bit lumpy.","Richard Fairbank","Brian I just want to add you asked if there's an inflection point in the Interchange thing. I think that we don't think that it bounces around a lot from quarter-to-quarter, this happened to be a quarter where there was strong Interchange but that's not necessarily a breaking point I think that we continue to expect Interchange growth in net Interchange revenues to be below growth in purchase volumes. And let us not forget last quarter, I think the growth was negative. So this thing is much better just quaint your eyes and look at like annual, annual trends in sort of the relationship between purchase volume growth and Interchange growth.","Brian Foran","Maybe coming back to the closing remarks of the opening scripts, you made around digitalization, this is something really three years now you've been talking about in pretty organically and when you started it was kind of remember when you first said wrestle APIs, I had glue sounds like which call am I on but we've seen more and more banks come out and really start talking about, you\u2019re talking about two or three years later, so if I'm going to talking to investors that helps make it like okay see I believe was talking for so long is important but still find it's hard for people to kind of put some tangible parameters around it, how does digitalization and APIs and Middleware actually translate to better revenue or better cost. So I\u2019m sure there is some hesitance about telling your competitors everything you're doing but I wonder if there's are there one or two examples you could give backward looking, how this multi-year digital journey has started to produce benefits either greater revenue or less cost or a combination of both?","Richard Fairbank","Yes, thank you, Brian. So first of all, we've been -- look I mean it was 20 some years ago that same phrase I use now it's a build I used it way back then which is build an information based technology company that happens to do banking competing against banks that happen to use information and technology. And I'm very struck that I've got the same battle cry 20 some years into that. But the other striking thing to me even though I think Capital One's pretty well positioned to do something like this is just how staggering the amount of change that that's going on and that will happen in the industry and the need to really transform ourselves across talent and infrastructure the way we work, how we develop software where really there's nothing that left unchanged.","So where have we seen the -- where can you see the benefit, no one can disentangle, what -- no one can prove what happens when your customers are a lot more delighted. How that affects things like growth and retention and things like that but I just would say that and it's very easy Brian for you to I'm not going to rattle them all here there's a lot of various proof points associated with a dramatic increase in Capital One's the customer satisfaction, the go to the app store and look at the ratings on the App Store that between the digital experience, the customer experience go to our own -- go to our own website and look at the ratings that and reviews that people put up on our own account.","There for a variety of reasons, one of which is our digital transformation we have had a tremendous momentum with customers that that, that is pretty linked to the kind of exceptional growth that we have seen look in the auto business I don't know if you've seen some of the technology that we're employing in the auto business associated with auto navigator, I would suggest take a look at that, that's pretty interesting. I can never prove to you what the contributions of delighted customers are on the growth front.","Secondly on the marketing front there is there is an obvious and dramatic transformation going on in marketing and how it works and the growing role of digital marketing, digital marketing itself is got the word digital in it and it's about digital capabilities and in fact information based strategies that has been an important contributor to Capital One's success.","The other thing that's going on is you've seen what's happening with our efficiency ratio, which got worse before it got better but the important thing is that it's getting better by a lot.","And when I started on this journey I said that look I want to make one thing clear so, many banks are saying in there -- in their public statements we are going to sell fund our digital investment I say I've been saying to investors for years and it's really five years actually this -- this journey has been not the three that you necessarily refer to but that over this journey I said that I don't believe anyone can transform their company and be competitive in the future by self funding this transformation that is you've got to pay now and get benefits later.","I also said that the biggest motivator of our digital investment is not the -- is not a cost objective it really is much better customer experience a -- building a way more dynamic well managed fast first to market better controlled all those other kind of benefits that come with this. All of that said it's very clear that we are increasingly reaping important sizable benefits and efficiency as a result of years of digital investment and the efficiency comes across the distribution channels of retail, call centers, operations, centers it also the transformation and how we work as long-term benefits many of which we've started to realize. So the interesting thing is a journey that was never motivated to be number one for the sake of cost savings something where it cost a lot that the costs were a lot higher than the than the benefits at the outset those relative meters are on their way to some significant change in position there and the -- so it is the efficiency ratio would be that the final place that I would point to.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Yes, hi thanks for taking my question and just one question. Going back year I think you're -- you were having better than industry card growth I think you were somewhat balanced between new accounts and line extensions. You now pulled that growth and I'm wondering has the composition of growth changed is it coming more from one of those aspects or the other and to the extent it's changing what does that mean to the risk characteristics going forward.","Richard Fairbank","John, so we -- we had if you dial all the way back I may get my years slightly wrong here but I think around the well '13 timeframe we had what we called the brownout of line increase and that was driven by a new regulatory requirement that required you to obtain income -- customers income before we could actually do a line extension and implementing the whole way to obtain that data and so on led to a brownout in our line increases even as our originations were continuing at a reasonable level.","Then what happened is the -- right around the time that we got the technology and the ability to address the regulatory requirement, that also coincided with sort of the big growth opportunity at Capital One it contributed to but also coincided with so that we had a surge in line increases and then a surge in young customers who are also eligible for line increases. So I flagged over the especially 2014, 2015 time period that we were having a more than probably normal level of line increases in the overall mix of our business.","Over the past I'm getting my timeframes I'm only approximating here but something I would argue around to be around the beginning of 2016 we got into pretty much an equilibrium between line increases and originations themselves and we have generally been in that equilibrium ever since.","To your point and to an earlier point that I said if anything our dial back more on the line increase side than the origination side of late so it is possible the mix between those two could move to the other side of equilibrium but I don't think these changes are big enough to call that out. But I think that the more -- the more important thing which is what we called out in the 2014-2015 timeframe that those were more than a the little bit more than their share of the line -- the normal share of line increases.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our last question from tonight is from Ken Bruce with Bank of America.","Ken Bruce","Thanks, good evening. Nice quarter the first question I have is this really relates to losses and in the quarter for the U.S. credit card business is at 5.11 that was a pretty substantial improvement in the month of June just based on the monthly reporting is -- was there anything specific that impacted that June performance and had something on the order like close to 50 basis point improvement month over month.","Richard Fairbank","Ken, no nothing that jumped out at us. One thing that were certainly were delighted to see the 47 basis point sequential quarter improvement in charge-offs but we always caution don't get too carried away with any one month. Because in fact as a point in the opposite direction that you obviously noticed the delinquencies after several months of going down actually went up a bit in the month. So they're kind of going in the opposite direction I think we looked at both of those, look we looked very carefully at every month worth of data but I think that we should all just squint our eyes a bit and look at a bit the bigger pattern and don't -- don't get too carried away with any one month of data.","The big point is we still expect the growth math effects measured in terms of year-over-year increase in delinquencies and loss rates to moderate over the rest of 2017 to have a small tail in 2018 and in fact, we were just talking about this today that one of the quarters we're actually going to, say goodbye to the growth -- to growth math and it's and it's not going to really be newsworthy and we're going to be back and rising and our numbers rising and falling with the dynamics of the marketplace but we are growth math quarters are numbered here before we retire it which is a good thing. We look forward to that retirement party.","Ken Bruce","I'm sure. There was a similar small shift but one if it continues could be have a substantial impact on that growth math but there's a the slight shift in the above 660 credit scores versus the below 660 credit scores; is that something that is a specific strategy of Capital One to accelerate one versus the other or is that just kind of a by-product of what you discussed around the trimming around the underwriting and so forth and if I could just make that a two part question you kind of answered Betsy\u2019s question around recoveries differently but have you seen a change in the charge-off debt prices that are in the market.","Richard Fairbank","On the charge-off debt prices I do not have any reason. I haven't been in a conversation associated with that and I think that I would have heard about it if something was newsworthy there but I don't rely on me for a latest read on that. The -- let me talk about the sub-prime mix so, our sub-prime mix has been -- our first of all our strategy as a company is stayed very steady over the years and we've been going as you know right at the top of the market and all the way through to the higher end of the sub-prime market place and over the -- over the last couple of years basically during this growth surge you have seen our sub-prime mix grow from I'm doing this from memory but around 34% up to 37% last quarter and it dropped down to 36%.","First of all I want to point out in the world of all the precision we all live by, these are rounded to the nearest integer. And sometimes the story is nothing more than a rounding story obviously when you go up several hundred basis points that that there's a trend there and what we've said is the -- the opportunity that we have seen in the sub-prime market place relative in and I'm now speaking in the -- in the years of 2014, 2015, also the lower competitor little bit lower competitive intensity there all of that contributed to sub-prime's share growing a little bit. The strategy is really the same, the number is settle down a little bit Cabela's is going to come along and hopefully everything works out perfectly there and it comes in and that will take a little bite out of the sub-prime mix as well. ","But the big story is I think we see the opportunity to be across the board you're probably right a little bit more of our trimming around the edges has been in the higher risk areas or higher loss areas so that that just brings the sub-prime thing in just a little bit but I, my main point is the more things change. The more they really stay the same.","Jeff Norris","Thanks Rich and thanks everybody for joining us on the conference call today. Thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One.

Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norris - Investor Relations","Thanks very much, Lauren, and welcome, everybody to Capital One's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, you can log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there.","In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our third quarter 2015 results. With me this evening are Mr. Rich Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Steve Crawford, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Steve are going to walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, and then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements.

Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Steve?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jeff. For the third quarter, Capital One earned $1.1 billion or a $1.98 per share, and had a return on average tangible common equity of 14.3%. On a continuing operations basis, we earned a $1.99 per share. Net income was up $251 million versus the prior quarter driven by higher linked-quarter pre-provision earnings and slightly lower provision expense.","Pre-provision earnings increased by $375 million versus the prior quarter as we had higher revenue and lower non-interest expenses. As a reminder, we had $188 million of non-recurring operating expenses in the second quarter. Excluding non-recurring expenses, operating expenses were relatively flat versus the prior year.","Provision for credit losses decreased 3% on a linked-quarter basis driven by a smaller allowance build. During the quarter, we added $69 million to our UK PPI reserve with $49 million as a contra-revenue and $20 million in operating expense. We have included in an appendix slide in our earnings presentation available on our website, illustrating the impacts from non-recurring items to key line items and ratios in both the quarter and year-to-date.","The increase in our UK PPI reserve is driven by proposed new rules announced by the FCA in early October. As always, our 10-Q will provide further details on the factors we consider in estimating our reserve. Excluding the impact from the build in UK PPI reserve, earnings per share in the quarter were $2.10 per share.","Turning to net interest margin. As outlined on slide four, reported NIM increased 17 basis points in the third quarter to 6.73%, primarily driven by higher loan yields in domestic card and an additional data day to recognize revenue in the third quarter. We continue to be above the fully phased in LCR requirements as of September 30, 2015.","On slide five you can see our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 12.1% as of September 30, 2015. On a fully phased in basis, we estimate the Standardized ratio would be approximately 11.8%. This fully phased in ratio is subject to change once we exit parallel run and we expect it to be lower. We reduced our net share count in the quarter by 7.6 million shares, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We entered parallel run for Basel III Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015, and we continue to estimate that we are above our 8% target.","Let me now turn the call over to Rich.","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on slide seven with our domestic card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Year-over-year, ending loans and average loans were both up 12%, and purchase volume was up about 19%. We continue to see attractive and resilient growth opportunities in the domestic card business.","Revenue increased 10% year-over-year, slightly lagging average loan growth. Revenue margin declined year-over-year and remains healthy at 17%. Year-over-year, non-interest expenses increased 7% with higher marketing and growth related operating expenses, as well as continuing digital investment. Credit continues to perform in line with our expectations in both our existing portfolio and our new originations.","Two factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is growth math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio. The second is seasonality. The third quarter has always been our seasonal low point. As a reminder, all else equal, seasonality results in increasing charge-off rate in the fourth quarter, rising the peak charge-off rate in the first quarter. This pattern has been particularly pronounced for the last couple of years and we expect that to continue.","In the third quarter, the charge-off rate improved 34 basis points from the linked-quarter to 3.08% driven by seasonality. Year-over-year the charge-off rate increased 25 basis points, primarily as the result of expected growth math impact. We still expect the quarterly charge-off rate to be in the mid to high-3% range in the fourth quarter. And in 2016, we expect the full year charge-off rate to be around 4% with quarterly seasonal variability. Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the quarter, and we expect these same factors to drive allowance additions going forward.","Slide eight summarizes third quarter results for our consumer banking business. Ending loans were flat compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto loan growth is predominantly prime as subprime auto originations have been essentially flat for several quarters. As a result, the mix of our auto loans is shifting toward prime.","Consumer banking revenue was up 1% year-over-year. Higher revenues from growth in auto loans was largely offset by the impacts of persistently low interest rates on the deposit business, declining mortgage balances, and margin compression in auto.","Non-interest expense increased 5% year-over-year, driven by infrastructure and technology expenses in retail banking and growth in auto loans. Provision for credit losses was relatively flat compared to the prior year at a $188 million. Auto originations increased about 3% year-over-year and from the linked-quarter. We've discussed increased competition in pricing and underwriting for some time.","In the third quarter, we continued to see aggressive underwriting practices by some competitors, particularly in subprime. We continue to lose some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices. We've also seen some softening in used vehicle values, although they remain near historically high levels. We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our longstanding focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers.","Our consumer banking businesses face continuing headwinds. Persistently low interest rates will continue to pressure returns in our deposit businesses, even if rates begin to rise in 2016. Planned mortgage runoff continues and auto margins are compressing from exceptional levels due to the mix shift toward prime and continuing competitive pressure. We expect these trends will negatively affect revenues and efficiency ratio for the remainder of 2015 and in 2016.","Moving to slide nine, I'll discuss our commercial banking business. Ending loan balances increased 5% year-over-year and 2% from the linked-quarter with most of the growth in specialized industry verticals in CRE and C&I. Average loan balances were up 6% year-over-year. As we've been signaling, our growth has slowed compared to prior years because of choices we're making in response to market conditions. While increasing competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in plain vanilla CRE and C&I, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals.","Revenues for the quarter were essentially flat compared to the prior year and down 5% from the linked-quarter. Continuing spread compression drove the quarterly revenue trend. Year-to-date, revenues are up 7% with 9% growth in average loans, partially offset by the 22 basis point decline in loan yields.","Credit performance remained strong for the majority of our commercial businesses, but credit pressures continue in the oil and gas and taxi medallion portfolios. Provision for credit losses increased $66 million from the prior year to $75 million with higher charge-offs and allowance build. The charge-off rate of 26 basis points was up from both the prior year and the linked-quarter driven by charge-offs of taxi medallion loans. We've built allowance over the last four quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans. In the third quarter, non-performing loans were up $292 million from the prior year to $453 million, and the NPL rate was up 55 basis points to 0.87%. These trends resulted from downgrades of oil and gas loans, and to a lesser extent, downgrades of taxi medallion loans. On a linked-quarter basis, NPL rate improved three basis points.","We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Through Hibernia, we've been in this business for more than 50 years through multiple cycles. Of our approximately $3.2 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans, around half is in exploration and production. In this part of the business, loan structures provide some protection against the oil price cyclicality. Around a third of our energy loans are in oilfield services. We expect this part of the business will continue to present challenges and we've been building reserves to reflect that concern. Our taxi medallion loan portfolio is less than $1 billion in loans. In the face of growing competition from Uber and other entrants, taxi medallion values continue to be under pressure and we continue to closely manage risk in this sector.","Finally, in the quarter, we announced the acquisition of the GE Healthcare Finance business, which will add approximately $8.5 billion in loans to our existing healthcare specialty business. We're thrilled to welcome GE Healthcare's outstanding leadership and talented associates to Capital One. The acquisition catapults us to a leading position in an industry with strong growth potential. We expect to complete the acquisition by the end of the fourth quarter.","Capital One posted solid results in the third quarter, highlighted once again by strong growth in our domestic card business. We're delivering attractive risk adjusted returns today and investing to grow and sustain returns in the future. We continue to expect full year 2015 efficiency ratio will be around 55%, excluding non-recurring items. Our expectation for full year efficiency ratio implies a significant increase in fourth quarter non-interest expense and fourth quarter efficiency ratio.","Both efficiency ratio and NIE are subject to potentially significant quarter-to-quarter variability. Both typically increase in the fourth quarter, and growth related operating and marketing costs will likely accentuate the fourth quarter increase this year. Given these three factors, we're still estimating full year efficiency ratio will be around 55% even though the third quarter efficiency ratio is meaningfully lower.","In July, we said that we didn't expect much improvement in full year 2016 efficiency ratio compared to full year 2015. Since we gave that guidance just one quarter ago, the outlook for interest rates has reduced 2016 forecasted revenues. However, we remain optimistic about our progress and the trajectory of the underlying operating drivers of efficiency ratio.","We are managing costs tightly across our business. Our card growth will create positive operating leverage. And while not solely motivated by cost savings, our digital investments are already delivering tangible savings and productivity gains in servicing, core infrastructure, and our legacy operations. We expect that these savings will grow and will help operating leverage over time. As we move three months closer to 2016, we expect modest improvement in full year efficiency ratio in 2016 excluding non-recurring items.","Pulling up, Capital One is well positioned to deliver attractive shareholder returns over the long-term with growth potential and sustained returns at the higher end of banks, as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.","And now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?","Jeff Norris - Investor Relations","Thanks, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to the other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, I ask that you please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.","Lauren, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Betsy.","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, Betsy.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So just two questions, one a follow-up on what you just indicated that you have sufficient expectation for having some operating leverage in 2016, and that's primarily coming from the savings that the digital investments are making. So is that coming from legacy ops? You'd be able to run them a little bit more efficiently, or is that more from top-line, if you could just talk to those two things?","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it's a \u2013 there's no one place to point. If we go back to last quarter, we said we didn't expect much improvement in full year 2016 efficiency ratio, excluding non-recurring items of course, compared to full year 2015. We noted Betsy of course that we were predicting a volatile number 15 months in advance. We also said the investments that will pressure our efficiency ratio would over time contribute to positive operating leverage. And most notably, of course, those are our investment in card growth and our digital investment. We're now three months closer which helps reduce uncertainty somewhat and we have three more months of card revenue growth baking in the oven.","We also continue to drive hard for cost savings and we've seen some solid tangible evidence of cost savings arising from our digital investments, and we know these savings will increase over time. And we have identified more contingent cost levers to manage some of the revenue uncertainty. And while we are of course still one and a quarter years away from the end of 2016, we have enough confidence to say that we expect modest improvement in full year efficiency ratio in 2016 excluding non-recurring items.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right got it. And then on your comments around the NCO outlook for card in 2016, is that a function of the 4% that you mentioned, average for the full year. Is that the function of what you're seeing in the portfolios today seasoning, or is that a function of how you think new portfolios are going to traject or is it a function of a potential slight slowdown in loan growth where reduction in new portfolios reduces the NCO ratios or increases the NCO ratios somewhat, maybe you could just tease that out a little bit?","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Betsy, it's really, I think just a \u2013 how the growth math manifests itself in the context of having gone from a relatively low growth environment to an accelerating growth environment, and how the losses play out. Let's talk about that growth math for a bit. If you just looked at our back book, you'd see exceptionally low and still improving credit loss. And that's because the back book is made up mostly of customers who weathered the great recession, and it's also exceptionally seasoned as a result of low levels of originations over many years.","So from the starting point of that back book, now almost any new business that we originate of course will have higher losses. And as a general rule of thumb, losses on new loans tend to ramp up over a couple of years, and then peak and gradually come down. So when we accelerate growth, the majority of the loss effects you're felt over the subsequent two years. And this is the dynamic we've been calling growth math and things are continuing very much consistently with our own expectations with respect to how the credit is manifesting itself on the early vintages. And so what we have done, as we get another quarter into this and another quarter closer is to give you a bit of an extended window into basically the same growth math phenomenon that that we've been talking about for several quarters.","Jeff Norris - Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Rich, could you talk a little bit about kind of the competitive environment in cards? I mean as we've listened to some of the other players that have reported, one of the themes that has come up is that account acquisition hasn't been as much of a challenge as rewards. Can you kind of talk about both of those factors?","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Moshe, my overall comment I would say about the competitive environment is that it's fairly consistent. It's pretty intensely competitive, but overall relatively consistent, again, relative to some of the things that we see in some of the other banking businesses that we're in. But taking the different components of what we're seeing here, starting with balances, just \u2013 industry balances as you know Moshe, of course, have been relatively flat for quite a while, but now industry-wide those are certainly moving up.","So, industry revolving debt helped steady it about 1% for most of 2012 and 2013, but since July of 2014 it's been over 3% growth and over 4% growth in recent months. And bank card outstandings are up about 4% year-over-year. So the first factor that we see is that there is return to just ambient levels of kind of balance growth in the industry. Pricing has been stable in the segments that we play in.","Competition continues to be very intense, especially in rewards but generally stable. The one place that we would flag as where the competition has really increased substantially, and to a point of concern is in the partnership side, the bidding has become very intense in this auction-based market and there've been some very aggressive deals which we're not going to pay whatever it takes in that space. But that to me is the most striking thing that is in motion. Specifically with respect to rewards competition, one thing I want to say is, while it has some stability to it, it is intensely competitive and it has been that way for a lot of years. So, I think the major players, who are in it are very invested in it and it sort of takes years to build the brand and the market position to be able to succeed in that space. I see the players in that space being generally investing intensely; relatively consistent with what we've seen in the past, but certainly that's a very competitive (25:24).","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just a follow-up. I mean, given that you've got double-digit growth in net interest income and a decline actually year-over-year in interchange income, would you and what your comments just now about balance growth returning at the industry level, I mean do you think this is a little bit of the return of the lend-centric model?","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, that \u2013 I wondered the same things as I saw some of the industry data, Moshe. I wouldn't necessarily declare that. I think that off of just such a stagnant growth environment, I think that there is some growth in the industry. But certainly relative to the last time, we saw the boom in the lending-centric environment, of course back then, Moshe, we saw some really kind of crazy practices that got into some of the products in the industry, just intense teaser wars all over the place.","Now, of course, for those who choose to play in that segment, that's certainly going on. And people stretching in terms of credit risk and so on. It's what we saw again in the mid-00s. So I wouldn't say we see anything like that at this point, but I think it's good for you to make note that there has been a bit of a pickup in terms of balances and we'll have to see where that goes.","Jeff Norris - Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right, great. So I got one question on the charge-off rate expectations. So Rich, you mentioned 4% for next year and how losses would peak, I guess, in the first quarter. I mean is that what the trajectory will be into next year? And then we should expect it to moderate thereafter?","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, could you just repeat your question one more time, Sanjay?","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Sure. Sure. Sure. So, you mentioned how charge-offs would peak in the first quarter, and then you talked about the full year charge-off rate being 4% for 2016. So should we expect a moderation in the loss rate after the first quarter?","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. Our point about \u2013 there is a seasonal effect. There's two different effects going on. One is the seasonal effect. And if you allow yourself to just say, if everything else were equal, here are the seasonal patterns and I described those several minutes ago, and that has the characteristic of peaking, as you described. Overlaid on top of that is another very important thing, which is the growth math of the acceleration that we have had in our business and that actually picks up steam over time. So, for example, we had pointed to sort of in the second half of 2015 that you will start seeing the net effects of growth. In fact growth \u2013 very early on when you start to accelerate growth, the losses actually in a sense have a movement in the other direction because you get a build of a denominator before the numerator picks up steam. But anyway, it's around this time, the third quarter of this year that the growth math is starting to play an increasingly important role. That's why you're now starting to see year-over-year growth in our charge-off numbers. So the guidance for the full year 2016, we're not giving quarterly guidance but it will have seasonal effects and then the increasing growth math effects and they will combine in our view to generate a full year average loss rate of around 4%.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. I guess my follow-up question, maybe for Steve or yourself. When I look at the card yield, year-over-year, you obviously started growing loans at a faster clip. But the yield doesn't seem to be increasing all that much. Is that related to the mix of the types of accounts that you guys are originating or what exactly is driving that because I would have thought you'd see that move up some?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","I don't know why the yield would move up, Sanjay, because it's just average relative to the portfolio is. So I'm not sure you'd see a change in yield. I'm sorry if I'm misunderstanding the question. There's not a mix change in the portfolio if that's (30:59)","Jeff Norris - Investor Relations","Sanjay, I think we've lost you. If you want to follow-up with me after the call \u2013 feel free to do so.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Cool, thanks.","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","So now let's go to the next question. Oh! You're still on, Sanjay?","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Yeah, it's all right. It's cool. We'll talk afterwards. Thanks.","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Next question then.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey good evening, guys. Rich, I know a couple of people have asked credit questions and maybe I'll try to ask it another way. So it sounds like 3Q or 4Q is really the starting point of the pickup in growth math. So assuming we don't see any further accelerations in loan growth, but does that imply that beyond 2016 we will continue to see a ramp in losses just because of the two-year period that you talked about before. And what does that mean for provisions, as we think about 2016? And lastly, does it continue to ramp once we get beyond that?","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. There is too many factors that lie between now and the end of 2016 to make a forecast at this point on what's going on in 2017. You do make a very good point though, that we all should remember, that at the end of the day of course as we get into the latter parts of 2016, the allowance build will be driven very much by what's happening with losses and very importantly what's happening with growth at that period of time.","But I think that the main point that I wanted to make is just the way growth math works. It's in the first two years after \u2013 for any vintage of growth, where the losses are climbing. And then they settle out and actually ultimately go down in any one sort of vintage of growth. So, all of this is the math of some things going and after they \u2013 so for example, as we get towards the latter part of 2016 and into 2017, some of the early growth vintages will be starting to settle out and you still have the effects of course of some of the more recent growth that we hope happens over the course of next year, for example.","But I think that, keeping in mind, this general effect of what happens over the two-year period following a surge in growth and then understanding it's the blend of all the different vintages and the timing of that, I think that's pretty much how we would guide you at this point. Obviously, collectively, things eventually stabilize in just the math of when accelerated growth happens for a period of time and settles out.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Maybe just one quick follow-up for Steve. I think, some of us might think modestly down can mean different things. So can you just help us understand, what you would consider to be modest improvement on efficiency \u2013 the range?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think those words were chosen carefully and we're probably not going to go a lot further than the guidance that was given. So I appreciate you trying and we'd like to be more precise, but I don't think particularly at this point more precisions probably in your or in our interest.","Next question please.","Operator","We'll go to David Ho with Deutsche Bank.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon. In the U.S. card business, let's (34:56) see that the card fees rose nicely versus the overall volumes, closing the gap more so than previous quarters. Is that function of maybe dialing back the contra-revenue rewards or is it more a function of better activation and engagement and could we expect this to continue?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I'm not really sure where you're coming to that conclusion. So what's bothering you (35:22)?","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","The domestic card non-interest income was up 7% and higher than previous quarters versus your purchase volume growth of 19%?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. There's just a bunch of different factors, I think, that can move around on a quarterly basis. I don't think there's anything systemic or trend-wise that we'd point out. I think it's much better to probably look at these things on an annual basis.","David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then on the auto regulatory environment, what's your outlook there, and has that been a part of the reason why you pulled back in subprime? And in terms of what would get you back into that business, given how fragmented the industry is, what industry conditions would you need for you to increase the originations?","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So look, well we very much like the business and we spent 15 years building the capability to underwrite and manage risk in, for example, the subprime auto business. So the flagging that we have done in recent quarters about some of the practices that we see again is causing us to, ultimately effectively slow down the origination growth that we had had. We're still generating good business and we love the business.","You mentioned the regulatory word, it is really not \u2013 our slow down, if you will, in origination growth is not driven by regulatory considerations. It's really driven by competitive situations, and in subprime most importantly some of the lending practices that we see that where I think more risk is being taken than we are comfortable to take to win a particular piece of business and that's really what we're flagging there.","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Citi.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Rich, given your comments on partnership pricing, as you look out to 2016, what are your thoughts on portfolio acquisitions or other purchases. Are you seeing anything that's remotely of interest? You've got a pretty interesting deal on the GE Healthcare portfolio? How do you think about 2016?","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well I mean, we've often said about acquisitions that, look, the marketplace is always in flux. And we said that we would continue to be interested particularly in asset purchases and partnership businesses. Those would be the primary areas of focus. The partnerships, in many ways, we've not been the market clearing price on some of the recent partnership biz, and I think our actions and discipline kind of speak for itself. But with respect to asset businesses we're really excited about the unique opportunity. It's very unusual thing to be able to, in an acquisition at an attractive price, get someone that is like the leading and just absolute amazing performers that somebody like GE Healthcare business is.","So a lot of planets aligned for us to get that. It is a byproduct of as I've said we watch the marketplace and look for opportunities, but as you can see over the last number of years, we done more looking than we have buying anything. But I think the GE business represents a very special opportunity that arises, but it is a very unique thing. I don't think \u2013 I think it is you could probably measure in decades the number of times a business comes along with such a good business and a market leading position where that can be obtained at a reasonable price. So we're happy about that, but that's not an indication that we're moving in the big acquisition mode in the slight.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","If I could just clarify one quick thing. You had mentioned softer used car pricing for auto. Is that seasonal, I guess this would be the time you'd see that or are you sort of seeing something beyond seasonality that's noteworthy?","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","First of all we've been talking about auction prices for a long time. And the biggest reason that we put so much focus on is, if you look back in a historical context, we are at record levels in terms of where auction prices are. And they have sustained at record levels for a long period of time. And now there're arguments for that. Cars are lasting longer and there're lot of things about that. But the thing that matters from an underwriting point of view is not how long a car lasts or its value on the other end, it's what its value is relative to what you underwrite, wrote it, expecting it.","So I just think in general, there is asymmetrical risk in the auto finance industry when auction prices sustain as they have for a significant number of years at record levels. And probably although we underwrite to a decline in prices, at some point, I think there's just a risk that the industry gets a little too used to that. So that's in general, what we have been flagging here.","Now, if you look at the Manheim Index, you could go bowling on that flat index. Our own index that we see in the marketplace that's measured a little bit differently actually has shown recent declines relative to that. But the main thing is not so much what has happened and no it's really not a seasonal point. The main thing is just when we see small effects happening, we just talk a little bit louder to remind everyone that there's asymmetrical risk at the moment with respect to where auction option prices are. But I've been saying for several years and they just keep on being high, but that's what I wanted to flag on that.","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Next question, please?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Brendler with Stifel.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask another time on the U.S. card business non-interest income. I focused on last quarter net interchange revenue growth of only 6% last quarter, again this quarter 6% relatively flat. Steve, I thought you indicated last quarter that, that can bounce around and there's looks like a natural growth rate of interchange when you're growing volume at 19% that'd be a little higher than that. So are there any one-time items that are weighing your interchange growth or this is simply a function of all the high rewards cost products that you're having successfully in the marketplace?","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that in any one quarter \u2013 I wouldn't put too much stake or stock in any one quarter with respect to this metric. But I do want to \u2013 and probably the best ways to look at that is looking at periods like year-to-date, for example. Interchange revenue for Capital One has been \u2013 it's growing at 8%, for example. But just I want to get a little bit behind why there is this disconnect? And it has been going for a few years now and it will continue, although at some point, these numbers will converge.","But the difference between the GPCC purchase volume versus the interchange growth rate. And it isn't just \u2013 I mean, yeah so we are out with attractive rewards proposition. You can see them advertised on television for example. That is a factor. We are also upgrading rewards products for existing rewards customers. We're also extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And a higher mix of kind of all the originations that happened out there in the marketplace now have rewards than they had before. And really this phenomenon \u2013 every player I think is seeing the same phenomenon.","There are differences in degrees depending on strategies and how they're \u2013 especially the choices people make on do you want to go into your existing portfolio, how much are you going to take some cannibalization impact or not? But I think the main point is we're still having solid growth interchange. It's well below purchase volume. That effect will continue over time. But in the longer run, these things will converge. In the meantime, we feel really good about the economics of reward products and the choices that we're making and the customers that we're originating.","Steve, did you want to add anything to that?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","No.","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And I may have some unrelated follow-up. In the UK business, it looks like things fell a little bit sequentially. Can you think about (46:20) update on the UK business and how you are thinking about it and how changes in interchange rates in the UK could potentially impact your marketing and growth strategy there?","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We really like our UK business. It's a tremendous synergy to have that business when we have such a big U.S. business and we have a lot of cross-pollination going both ways and good business ideas going both ways and some of our best ideas actually sometimes come from our UK folks. That UK business isn't just a clone of our U.S. business and the most striking difference, if you look at the two, is sort of the absence in the UK of the big top-of-the-market transactor rewards driven business. So while interchange dropped significantly, our business never was a really top-of-the-market spender, heavy business. So the impact on us is relatively muted from the drop in interchange.","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","William Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good evening, Rich and Steve. Can you tell us what proportion of your portfolio is comprised of your back book versus your front book? And maybe help us understand what a normalized mix level between those books tends to be as you continue to grow?","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know, Bill \u2013 you didn't just like the eloquence of this great story about how back book performs and front book performs. They are really not \u2013 we don't have a thing at Capital One called just the back book's over here and the front book's over here because it's all a state of transition. Everybody starts in the front book over time and then moves into the back book. It is a general descriptive method that we use to say that the metrics that you're seeing on our portfolio are driven way disproportionately by the changes at the margin especially in originations, but also in terms of things like line increases as well.","So that the effects are so dramatic, particularly on a highly seasoned portfolio with just incredibly low losses like we have here. That's why we speak in terms of the front book and the back book, but they really \u2013 it's more of a method of explaining how the business works and...","William Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Right. But I guess I was kind of...","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Phil (sic) [Bill], if I could just say also, a big part of not being able to do what you would like in terms of forecasting it, I think you've heard Rich talk forever about growth being windows of opportunity we see in the market, and we're not planning every year to get a certain amount of growth when it's there and it makes sense we take it. So, that obviously makes it pretty difficult to look into the future and see how the mix is going to change over time, and hopefully it goes without saying that these originations are performing as we expect, and we believe these are going to work out really well for our shareholders over time.","William Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Right. I guess I was just trying to build off of the thought process that you guys described so well surrounding the growth math, and just the idea that you have peak losses somewhere around 18 months to 30 months. So if we just draw a line in the sand at, let's say, 36 months, then anything older than that is past peak losses, and you have declining charge-off rates relating to anything that's older than 36 months and anything younger than that is experiencing arguably rising charge-offs. And then so to the extent that you guys kind of stopped growing post the great recession and more of your book was comprised of the back book that was a larger percentage of your book, but now as you've been growing and kind of stepping on the gas, some of the newer vintages are representing a greater proportion of your overall book, and therefore that's creating some of the growth math headwind.","And so I was just looking for a little bit of color around the interplay of those moving parts, but if you can share that, I'd love to \u2013 either, if you have some more color you could share on that, that'd be great. Otherwise, I have a follow-up I'd like to ask.","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, actually you did an incredibly good job, probably better than I did of actually explaining the growth math general dynamics. So if you have specific questions, we'll try to answer them, but I think that if you look at Capital One right now, we're in kind of a striking position if you look at our metrics relative to a number of players.","First of all, you may remember that in the period preceding this, Capital One was actually near the bottom of the league tables in terms of growth. And we talked all about running off high balance revolvers. We kind of stopped talking all the time about that, but that's a phenomenon so we have had an exceptionally seasoned book. And then, now, as we're sort of on the leading side of the industry with respect to our growth, then you're also going to see our metrics will move in ways that will diverge from competitors, in striking ways and that's why it's really important that we all communicate as clearly as we can about growth math and separating what's the difference between just natural maturation of businesses and customers behaving exactly as we expect versus changes in underlying credit performance or things like that. So at this time, we are diverging from certainly some of the other players with respect to our credit performance. I again want to reiterate that things are coming in very consistent with our own expectations, both on the front book and on the back book.","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Spahr with CLSA.","Chris J. Spahr - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I noticed that most of the deposit growth has been in the other segment this quarter. Can you explain why that is and maybe if you'd raise the rates to kind of get that the business lines growing?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So that's really, our funding needs have been met more by wholesale funding sources including securitization, some brokerage CDs. We've been largely out of wholesale markets following the ING DIRECT acquisition and have been intentionally reestablishing our presence. That's just a market that you want to stay active in. Remember, wholesale funding is also an important part of the LCR calculations. So there're a couple reasons why we, in addition to being in a pretty efficient market, but we believe we're very well positioned to grow our deposits in our bank going forward.","Chris J. Spahr - CLSA Americas LLC","And can you give some guidance on the PPI charge outlook going forward?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","I really can't. We had the rules issued by the FCA and there is some specificity in how those actually work. So there's a two-year window for customers actually looking for a relief. And what we did was we took obviously everything that was in that release and used it to come up with our best estimate of reserves, but there are a lot of unknowns with respect to how the final nature of this is going to come in and how customer complaints will come in and obviously we've done our best to estimate that in reserves and to the extent that things change that that will something that we make you aware of.","Next question, please?","Operator","And for our last question this evening, we'll go to Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks guys for taking my questions too. Looking at some competitor data and some comments from your peers, it looks like there was a pickup in account growth which you cited the fact that your loan growth has been substantially in excess of your peer group, which everybody's certainly been tracking pretty closely. Curious how much of this is a function of new accounts versus utilization in line limit increases?","Richard D. Fairbank - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Rick, we also are enjoying a high level of account growth right now. Not sure I can speak for the other competitors but if you look at when we went from very little growth a couple of years ago, when the growth began, we said that our originations have picked up but also our line increases are going to be a little bit outsized here because we are making up for a period of time when we were not able to do line increases as we are working on a solution to a new regulation that had come out.","And so, early on in our growth surge we were a little bit more than normally weighted toward line increases. That has now reached pretty much an equilibrium where the line increases \u2013 the majority of our growth \u2013 and by the way \u2013 well I would say just generally a majority of our growth is coming on the origination side, and important minority of our growth is coming from line increases but it's pretty much at sort of an equilibrium at this point.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Second question, and it's a non-sequitur, but during the quarter you issued some preferred that we potentially would have thought would've appeared in the preferred expense during the quarter, it doesn't seem to. What's the run rate headed into Q4 in terms of preferred expense?","Stephen S. Crawford - Chief Financial Officer","I think that's the semiannual payment. So it's December and June. That's why you don't see it this time around.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Jeff Norris - Investor Relations","Well, thanks everyone for joining us on this conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norris","Thank you very much, Lisa, and welcome, everyone, to Capital One's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.","As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our fourth quarter 2012 results.","With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Gary Perlin, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer.

Gary?","Gary L. Perlin","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon to everyone listening on the call. I'm going to begin on Slide 3, which provides a few highlights from the year and quarter just ended, as well as our outlook. While I will not speak to all of the items on the slide, I'd like to give a few high-level comments.","2012 was an exciting year for Capital One. We completed the acquisitions of ING Direct and HSBC's U.S. Card business, 2 businesses that will deliver attractive financial and strategic returns for years to come. 2012 full year results also reflect solid underlying performance across all our businesses, as Rich will describe in a moment. Our balance sheet also grew significantly stronger, with ending Tier 1 common capital at 11% on a Basel I basis, positioning us well to meet our fully phased-in assumed Basel III target in early 2013.","While acquisition-related accounting created some pressure on GAAP earnings and substantial quarterly variations in our income statement during 2012, the variability abated considerably in the last couple of quarters. While purchase accounting explains a portion of the lower revenue and higher provision in our Domestic Card business in the fourth quarter, the linked-quarter reduction in corporate earnings is largely attributable to expected seasonal impacts on margins and noninterest expenses. We also issued a notice to call $3.6 billion in trust-preferred securities during the fourth quarter, which was completed earlier this month.","The buildup of cash in the fourth quarter ahead of the actual redemption created some temporary pressure on net interest margin although future interest expense will be reduced. Our views of 2013 have not changed since we discussed emerging quarterly trends in October. Much of the expected impact of merger-related credit accounting has now about run its course and a majority of expected synergies are being realized. Revenue will continue to be impacted by about $200 million in remaining premium amortization in 2013, and noninterest expense will continue to be affected by the amortization of PCCR and other intangibles for several more years, albeit at modestly declining levels. Much of the remaining integration of restructuring expense will also be incurred through the balance of 2013.","With a few exceptions, fourth quarter 2012 results give us a pretty good picture of what to expect in terms of pre-provision pretax earnings in 2013, assuming little change in the external environment.","As we said in October, overall noninterest expense in 2013 is expected to total about $12.5 billion or just over $3.1 billion on average per quarter. This reflects a decline in average quarterly expenses relative to seasonally elevated operating and marketing costs in the quarter just ended. It also assumes that we incur about $600 million of intangible amortization and about $220 million of the $350 million of remaining merger-related expenses all in 2013.","Average quarterly revenue levels in 2013 are expected to be in the same ballpark as in the fourth quarter of 2012. While average earning assets will fall modestly, net interest margin could be a bit higher, with steady yield on average earning assets and an expected reduction in interest expense.","As indicated last quarter, we expect a modest reduction in loan balances in 2013 as runoff of some $12 billion in ending loan balances of acquired mortgage and credit card loans is only partially offset by organic loan growth. At the same time, cash balances are declining with the call of TruPS in early January.","As for both ING Direct and HSBC, we continue to believe that they are both financially and strategically compelling. We are as excited about the acquisitions as we were the day we announced them. This is true even though the acquisition impacts will play through our 2013 financials differently than expected at announcement back in 2011. The deals created some $2.5 billion less in goodwill than originally anticipated due in large part to the impact of declining interest rates on fair value marks. As a result, we will achieve or exceed in 2013 our expected post-deal capital position, but we will do so earlier and with less reported earnings because we're amortizing fair value premium rather than accreting fair value discount.","Because we expect to generate capital in 2013 in excess of what is required for our balance sheet and that which is necessary to meet Basel III requirements, capital allocation will be a key lever to create and deliver shareholder value. We expect to begin our journey of returning increased capital to shareholders through the 2013 CCAR process already underway, which Rich will address and you'll hear more about in March.","Now turning to Slide 4, I'll discuss a few quick highlights of our fourth quarter summary income statement. Fourth quarter earnings were $843 million or $1.41 per common share. Compared to the third quarter, there was a modest expected decrease in revenue and increase in noninterest expenses.","Starting with Box A, the decrease in revenue from the third quarter was almost entirely driven by the return to more normal levels of revenue suppression in our Domestic Card business. As indicated during our October call, suppression in the third quarter benefited meaningfully from the effect of the remaining SOP 03-3 mark on delinquent loans acquired from HSBC. In addition, the fourth quarter has seasonally low levels of fee and finance charge reversals.","Looking at Box B, noninterest expenses increased 8% on a linked-quarter basis driven by year-end expense patterns, including marketing and somewhat higher integration expenses.","Looking at Box C, provision expense increased in the quarter, reflecting more normal charge-off levels and runoff of the HSBC purchase accounting mark that reduced provision expense in the last couple of quarters.","Turning to Slide 5, I'll touch briefly on net interest margin. Reported NIM decreased in the fourth quarter to 6.52%. Although interest expense was down by several basis points, 2 factors drove a much larger reduction in the yield on interest-earning assets. The first was a substantial increase in the proportion of lower-yielding cash and investment securities. In part, this was due to a buildup of liquidity in anticipation of the high-coupon trust-preferred securities which occurred in January 2 of this year and to an increase in investment securities designed to help move us toward our target interest rate risk position. The other factor causing NIM compression in the quarter was the expected increase in Domestic Card revenue suppression to more normal levels as I discussed earlier.","Compared to the fourth quarter, we expect average quarterly margins can improve modestly, with more stable yield on interest-earning assets and improving levels of interest expense owing to the recent call of high-coupon TruPS and ongoing deposit portfolio management.","It's also worth noting that we expect to incur an approximate $60 million onetime reduction in noninterest income in association with the call of the TruPS in the first quarter. But longer-term NIM trends will depend essentially on the general level of interest rates, ongoing pricing dynamics in the loan and deposit markets, shifts in the mix of earning assets and normal seasonal patterns.","As noted before and on Slide 6, our Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel I basis was 11% at year end. We expect to continue generating substantial capital in coming quarters.","As of January 1, we formally began our journey to adopt Basel II, also referred to now as Advanced Approaches, which for Capital One will take effect on or after January 1, 2016. Using our revolving estimates of this impact, Capital One's Tier 1 common ratio under currently proposed rules for implementing Basel III over coming years would be close to 8%. As with the estimate we provided in Q3, this incorporates 2 ongoing changes in our balance sheet, amortization of PCCR and the scheduled paydown of capital punitive investment securities. Even without these adjustments, we would reach the assumed 8% Basel III target in 2013.","Given our previously assumed target of fully phased-in Basel III capital of around 8% and our current capital trajectory, this implies that we will continue to generate substantial capital well over regulatory requirements.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich.","Richard D. Fairbank","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 7, which provides an overview of solid business results in the quarter.","Our Domestic Card business continues to deliver strong results. Ending loans grew 3.1% in the quarter or 4.1%, excluding the expected runoff of higher-margin, lower-loss -- excuse me, higher-margin, higher-loss HSBC loans, as well as the continuing runoff of installment loans. The increase was consistent with expected seasonal patterns. Year-over-year, ending loans were relatively flat, excluding the HSBC acquisition and the expected runoff of installment loans.","Purchase volumes, excluding HSBC, grew 9.4% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Looking ahead, the first quarter is typically the seasonal low point for both ending loans and purchase volumes, so we expect seasonal declines in both items in the first quarter.","Revenue margin decreased modestly in the quarter from 17.1% to 16.8%. The decline resulted from the expected seasonal patterns, franchise enhancements and purchase accounting effects we discussed last quarter. Our outlook for revenue margin has not changed. We expect the decline in the first quarter as the first quarter is the seasonal low point for Domestic Card revenue margin.","Beyond seasonal patterns, we continue to invest in the franchise enhancements we discussed last quarter, which will have a modest negative effect on revenue margin. These effects will be partially offset as purchase accounting impacts abate. As always, other factors which are much harder to quantify and predict will also affect revenue margin. These factors, which include market and pricing dynamics, credit trends and competitive intensity, could have positive or negative impacts on the revenue margin.","The charge-off rate for the quarter was 4.4%. For the last couple of quarters, our card -- credit metrics have been dominated by the addition of HSBC's card portfolio. HSBC ran at a higher loss rate than Capital One's Card business, but the addition of the HSBC portfolio temporarily improved our combined credit metrics because we took a credit mark on HSBC's credit card loans that had lost their revolving privileges.","The credit mark absorbed the bulk of the charge-offs from the HSBC portfolio in the second and third quarters. The credit mark did not have a meaningful impact on fourth quarter charge-off rate, and we don't expect the mark to have a meaningful impact in future quarters.","The Consumer Banking business posted another quarter of solid profitability. Ending loans declined about $1.6 billion, in line with our expectations. $700 million of continuing growth in Auto loans was more than offset by about $2 billion of expected mortgage runoff. Revenues decreased from the third quarter, driven by the absence of the favorable valuation adjustment to retain interest in mortgage securitizations we booked last quarter. Provision expense decreased modestly. While Auto Finance charge-off rate increased seasonally, the overall Consumer Banking charge-off rate remains below 1%.","Our Commercial Banking business continues to deliver strong and steady overall performance. Loans grew 4% in the quarter and 13% year-over-year. Revenues were up 3% in the quarter and 11% for the full year of 2012. Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter increased 16%, largely as a result of several nonrecurring items. For the full year, our expenses increased 15%, roughly in line with revenue growth. Our charge-off rate of 10% in the quarter demonstrates our -- excuse me, to 10 basis points in the quarter demonstrates our disciplined underwriting of credit. We expect the strong and steady performance of our Commercial Banking business to continue.","I'll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 8. Capital One delivered strong results in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our legacy businesses continue to deliver solid profitability despite the industry-wide challenges of an uncertain and fragile economy, prolonged low interest rates and elevated regulatory expectations. ING Direct and the HSBC U.S. Card business are making strong contributions to our business results. Credit trends are in line with our expectations. We've already achieved the majority of the expected synergies and expect to realize all of the announced run rate synergies by early 2013. Both integrations are on track and going very well. We're working toward a smooth and successful brand conversion later this quarter. As we continue to integrate both businesses, we like very much what we see.","The combination of Capital One, ING Direct and the HSBC U.S. Card business puts us in a strong position to deliver sustained shareholder value even in an environment with little to no growth and prolonged low interest rates.","We've carefully chosen banking businesses with attractive and resilient risk-adjusted returns, and we've worked hard for decades to build our capabilities to manage these businesses well and to achieve relevant scale where it matters most. We've demonstrated our ability to deliver solid and resilient performance through cycles, including the Great Recession. We're laser-focused on execution because it is a primary lever to deliver shareholder value. We're executing well on 2 large integrations simultaneously with excellent results. We're making solid progress on our efforts to deliver a company-defining customer experience that builds and sustains a valuable long-term customer franchise. And even as we complete our integrations and continue to invest to stay ahead of the rising regulatory expectations faced by all banks, we continue to tightly manage our operating expenses.","The other key lever to create and deliver shareholder value is, of course, capital generation and allocation, and we remain very well-positioned to deliver on this dimension. We're in a strong capital position, already very near our assumed Basel III target of 8% years ahead of regulatory requirements. Our assumed target represents the prudent level of capital we'll need to meet regulatory requirements under Basel II and Basel III, including the 7% regulatory requirement and assumed 50-basis-point SIFI buffer and 50 basis points to cover potential volatility in both the numerator and denominator of the Tier 1 common equity ratio.","Our actual operating levels for capital will vary over time, with a conservative bent. Factors that will determine operating capital levels include our outlook for near- to medium-term growth, our view of where we are in the economic cycle and our resilience under ongoing stress-testing processes.","Even as our operating levels for capital vary over time, we expect that we'll continue to generate substantial excess capital, and the cost of holding excess capital is not lost on us. Accordingly, we expect that we'll have significant capital to deploy in the interest of our shareholders. We'll apply a disciplined and thoughtful set of principles as we make capital allocation decisions. We'll deploy capital to fund growth with attractive and resilient returns and to pay a consistent, meaningful dividend. We expect to return to a meaningful dividend in 2013, following the completion of the current CCAR process. We expect to generate substantial capital beyond what we'll need to support growth in dividends. We currently expect average loan volumes to decline in 2013, and our longer-term growth outlook remains modest as continuing runoff is expected to offset more vibrant underlying growth where we're investing to grow. Although share repurchases are not part of the initial capital distribution in our current capital plan, we expect our capital generation will support significant share repurchases in subsequent iterations of our plan.","Pulling up, we've put Capital One in a position to deliver sustained shareholder value through surefooted execution and disciplined capital allocation for the benefit of our shareholders even in a environment that might not present growth opportunities. We're highly focused on delivering that value in 2013 and beyond.","And now Gary and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] If you have any follow-ups after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Lisa, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So I just had some clarification questions on the forward-looking commentary in the press release. I just want to be clear that we should assume roughly annual revenues of about $22.4 billion in 2013, and that basically annualizes the $5.6 billion that you guys did this quarter despite some of the seasonal pressures as well as those unique to the fourth quarter. And now on the expense side, the $12.4 billion, I guess, does that include integration costs?","Gary L. Perlin","Sure, Sanjay. It's Gary. Let me take the cost question first. I said $12.5 billion for the year, that's about 3.1 and change per quarter. And yes, that includes integration costs. That also includes about $600 million worth of amortization of PCCR and other intangibles as well. So that is a number that is GAAP-related. It also includes, as we've said before, about $11 billion of operating expense and $1.5 billion of marketing expense. And with respect to the view of revenue, yes, if you took the fourth quarter revenues and got to about a $22.5 billion number for 2013, that would be a reasonable expectation right now assuming that the external environment does not change materially, so we're dealing with the curve as we know it. We're dealing with loan demand as we know it. We're dealing with the amortization of premium, in revenue as well, that is about where we would expect to be.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Scott Valentin, FBR Capital Markets.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just with regard to the impact on margin, you mentioned you're holding a lot of liquid assets to pay off the TruPS. Is there any way you can quantify that in terms of either basis points or EPS for the quarter? And I have one follow-up question.","Gary L. Perlin","Scott, I can't really pull that apart for you other than to say that we did actually build that cash position relatively early in the fourth quarter even though we knew we didn't need the cash until January 2. With some of the uncertainties in Washington and so forth, we felt it was prudent to make sure we had that cash on hand. So we did have a full quarter worth of that additional cash, and you can do the math from there. Also, remember that we had a significant buildup in our securities portfolio as well, which is a bit below average for the overall margin. And it's something that you can expect we're going to continue to have. Roughly speaking, I think the combination of the impact of having that extra cash in advance of repaying the TruPS and the investment portfolio, let's call it about 20 basis points or just a little bit less than half of the compression in NIM you saw over the quarter. The balance would largely be explained by the increase in revenue suppression in card, which was a combination of seasonality and purchase accounting.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And as a follow-up, in the -- I think it was in the presentation, it mentioned some nonrecurring expenses at the bank that increased expenses for the quarter by 15% or 16%. Just wondering if you could quantify what those are, maybe some of the major expenses or if it was a sundry item?","Jeff Norris","Scott, it's Jeff. I can follow up and give you a little bit more detail on that after the call. But it was essentially, I think, some accounting-driven changes that are kind of technical in nature and nonrecurring.","Operator","And our next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch, Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I guess, could you maybe just talk a little bit -- I guess I'm a little confused by the change in kind of the revenue guidance and how we should think about that in terms of the progression into 2013 and '14, and perhaps whether your thought process now, given the loan growth, would include reserve build or reserve drawdown in 2013?","Gary L. Perlin","Moshe, it\u2019s Gary. So first off, we're not giving any particular guidance on what might happen to provision. Rich talked about stable credit, so you can assume that we might not speculate on big changes. But that would not obviously have a huge effect on revenue other than through suppression. With respect to the margins, we're really not changing our views. Things have become, I think, much clearer as the result of purchase accounting having played its way through. I think when you take a look at our net interest margin as we go forward from here, we've suggested it could be mildly higher with lower funding cost as we've repaid the TruPS. And then on the asset side, I think there are a bunch of positives and negatives that end up as best as we can tell, kind of evening each other out. On the negative side, it's mostly the industry challenges that Rich talked about. It's the interest rate environment, it's the competitive environment in many of our lending businesses, but we have some positives that are pretty unique to Capital One. We'll see a reduction in the impact of purchase accounting, although we have $200 million over the course of the year that is less than the average -- the average quarterly impact of that is less than what we have in the fourth quarter. The loans that are running off are predominantly mortgages, which tend to have the lowest margins. And then, of course, we'll be carrying less cash and we'll have the benefit on the funding side. Finally, we said last quarter that we would expect to see average loan balances going down in 2013, the combination of runoff of some $12 billion or so in ending loans from the acquired portfolios but very significant origination volume in our ongoing businesses, which would at least partially offset that runoff. So if you take together a modest reduction in average loans with a modestly improving margin, that would kind of get you to the ongoing level of revenue that we suggested this quarter.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just to be clear, those amortization costs are in the cost numbers that you mentioned, right?","Gary L. Perlin","Absolutely. Everything we have talked about is totally GAAP. And again, we've given you what the impact on GAAP is from our amortization of both premium and intangibles. And we're happy to give that to you again.","Operator","And up next is Brian Foran, Autonomous.","Brian Foran","I guess on the revenue suppression, which I think is a big part of the rebasing of revenue expectations for a lot of people. I guess maybe the question would be, you've referred to them as kind of expected and reaching a new normal. Clearly, there was an expectation maybe from some of the sell side and buy side that was lower, and so if you could give kind of a walk-through and maybe even just a little tutorial on how that works? And maybe within that also, you referenced seasonally higher revenue suppression but also referenced this being the new normal level, so what are the seasonal drivers of suppression? And is this the new normal of the fourth quarter level or is this just the new normal for the fourth quarter? And what's the seasonal patterns we should model in?","Gary L. Perlin","Okay. Brian, it's Gary. And, yes, what we're saying is that the levels are somewhat back to normal. I'll talk about the seasonality in a moment. But in the third quarter of this year -- or in third quarter of 2012, we still had a $70 million benefit from the credit mark which reduced our suppression level, and we called that out at that time. And in terms of the normal drivers of suppression, we also indicated that reversals were at or close to their seasonal lows because of the way that credit metrics go over the course of the year and the strongest credit performance tends to be in the third quarter, so our assessment of collectibility tends to be higher and we have fewer reversals. So fast-forward from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, we don't have the benefit of that $70 million absorption from the credit mark. We actually had a little less than $10 million, but that's going away very quickly. So we're without that benefit. And then in terms of reversals, because fourth quarter does tend to be a quarter in which the credit metrics start to become less favorable, you see that in charge-offs and other things. It also tends to increase seasonally the impact of reversals. What there was not any change in, between the third and fourth quarter to speak of, was any change in our long-term assessment of recoverability. So our finance charge and fee reserve isn't moving around. So from here on out, what you're going to see from quarter-to-quarter, assuming that we don't have big moves in our finance charge and fee reserve, you're effectively going to just see the actual reversals and the actual recoveries flowing through. So it should start to mirror pretty much what's going on in our other credit metrics. And again, you'll see some seasonal patterns there, but you won't see the kind of volatility that was introduced into these numbers over the course of the last year because of HSBC and the purchase accounting related to it.","Brian Foran","If I could ask as a follow-up, I mean, just more broadly. It seems like you've always had more quarterly EPS volatility than a normal bank in part due to the different seasonalities of the card business, and it seems like the HSBC business is really kind of exacerbating some seasonalities. I mean, how should we think about what are the 2 or 3 key things? I mean, clearly, we have the elevated marketing and provision to worry about every year in the fourth quarter. It seems like now the third quarter is kind of the best every year we should expect for revenue margins, I think, based on what you've said. Is there kind of other standouts that we should be aware of?","Richard D. Fairbank","Brian, yes. The card business has a lot of seasonality to it. And I think in some elements, Capital One has actually, I think, elevated seasonality because of our business model in some ways relative to other players. Let me just comment a bit about seasonality in some of these drivers. We have tended most often to talk about the credit seasonality metrics. And essentially, in delinquencies, they're slightly below average in the first quarter and they're at their lowest point in the second quarter because of tax refunds and consumer paying down holiday spending. The third quarter delinquencies tend to be slightly above average in the third quarter, and they peak in the fourth quarter. Charge-offs lag the delinquency trends and they see their peak in the first quarter. Second quarter charge-offs tend to be above average, while Q3 is the seasonally low point for charge-offs. And Q4 charge-offs tend to be about average for the year. Purchase volume, of course you know, is very seasonally intense and Q4 being really the big peak there. There's of course, seasonality in outstandings. They tend to be lowest in the first quarter, roughly average in the second and third quarter and at their highest in the fourth quarter. And average outstandings have some modest seasonal moves tending to be slightly above average in the second quarter and slightly below in the third quarter. One of the ones that gets more complex, and I think, over the years, we probably could have done a better job kind of, I think, articulating what happens with revenue margins. And revenue margins are influenced by both the seasonal -- I mean, by the credit and the purchase trends that I mentioned. And margins are the lowest seasonally in the first quarter because of depressed interchange as a result of the weak spending, coupled with the high revenue suppression from peaking charge-offs. And the second quarter is slightly below average primarily as a result of day count factors, to add another variable into this. And as we discussed last quarter, and you're right on that, Q3 margins are the highest seasonally because you get the credit impacts of some revenue from late fees as the delinquencies increase. And it's also -- and then Q4, is slightly above average as a result of purchases and interchange being at their highest levels. So I think what -- I think one thing, I think, we should take upon ourselves is to try to help and provide some systematic guidelines sort of around what we're talking about here and -- because I think there's enough seasonality and I think these quarters are examples of that, that I think we can provide a bit more. Rather than anecdotally discussing in a particular quarter, a little bit more comprehensive tutorial at some point on the nature of, in general, where the biggest peaks are and so on with respect to this.","Jeff Norris","And Brian, I might just add one other comment on that. Part of your question was that you thought that the HSBC acquisition had exacerbated seasonal patterns. We've taken a look at this and generally, we don't think that that's true. We think that our seasonal patterns are reasonably consistent. The one possible exception is the ending loan seasonality being a little bit more pronounced with the addition of the partnership business. I think the reason that seasonality seems to be more of a topic of conversation, more evident in the results these days, is relative stability of everything else. Normally, seasonal trends are somewhat obfuscated by cyclical trends, by growth and other things. And given the relative stability of everything else, seasonality is just showing through a little bit more these days.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Brendler, Stifel.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you discuss in a little more detail what you're seeing in the Domestic Card business from a credit perspective? It seems like delinquencies had underperformed the industry quite a bit, and we know you have more seasonality than most, but -- and I'm talking about trust not the managed base which includes HSBC. But is there any signs of some underperformance from your perspective? Because from our perspective, I mean, if you look at the trust in particular, it looks like your delinquency trends are quite a bit more than your peers. You've actually, if you look at the industry trust delinquency trends, you're now the highest among the big 6 issuers, which is -- I don't think has occurred in a long time. So I just want to make sure you're still comfortable. The reserves didn't go up this quarter, I'm making sure you're still comfortable with Domestic Card business and the credit you see there, excluding HSBC.","Richard D. Fairbank","So Chris, the credit is very, very, stable adjusted for the mix changes going on with HSBC and the seasonality metrics. I think that our metrics, our losses, for example, our credit metrics, in general, have more seasonality than a number of the other competitors. And so at some quarters like this one, you will see amplification in that. But there is one other effect though, if you -- so if you just take our card losses here, they increased in the quarter 131 basis points. Now the bulk of that increase was the runoff of the HSBC purchasing accounting impacts that was about 83 basis points of impact in the quarter. Most of the remaining impact was driven by normal seasoning. There's a little bit of noise in the various -- that we always have every quarter. But what we see is a very, very stable credit environment and credit performance for Capital One just sort of normalized for these effects I just talked about. The other phenomena, I think, that's going on when you do a cross calibration of our performance versus some of the other players in the card business, I think it's probably more newsworthy is not what's going on with us but what's going on with some of the others. You have a number of competitors who have, I think, kind of altered the mix of how they're pursuing the business. And I think they fall into a couple of camps. Some competitors that are just really focusing on going right after the top of the market and some competitors that have been focused on the prime revolver segment and doing a lot of the heavy activity there in the sort of teaser rate, high-balance revolver segment. In each of those cases, those particular activities can affect their metrics in ways that, I think, again, the more newsworthy things probably what's happening to them. So those that are heading north, so to speak, in the marketplace, I think you can expect a steady decline even in stable environment with respect to their credit metrics. Those that are more intensely following -- pursuing the high-balance revolver segment will have sort of the, what we call the speedboat or denominator effect on their metrics and then ultimately whatever performance comes from those. The big story about Capital One is that we are pretty much doing what we did going -- before the Great Recession, during the Great Recession and now. And there's a real stability to that overlaid on top of a very stable kind of overall credit environment. But I do think, it is -- I do want to set the expectation that our stability of strategy versus some of the other changes will cause a divergence in the credit metrics. And then of course, we've got HSBC joining our portfolio. And now as the credit mark effects subside from that, you're talking about, about a 40- to 60-basis-point just general rise on our portfolio charge-off metrics.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can I ask a quick follow-up?","Richard D. Fairbank","I'm sorry, can I just say one final thing. Of course, we do this -- this is very purposeful how we manage the business, and I think our reward comes on the revenue side. And of course, I think the revenue margins kind of speak for themselves. Yes, go ahead, you have another question. Yes.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a related question, Rich. I think remember back to the CARD Act, I think it was going to level the playing field and would help you gain share. And listening to your comments just now on credit, I'm struck by you don't seem to be gaining share. And if I look at a core year-over-year card number excluding all the noise, I'm getting about 0% growth. The industry is supposedly growing low-single. Discover, in particular, is growing 6% last quarter. Is that because of the same impacts or the same marketing strategy that you're talking about going after the higher balances? How do you feel about Cap One's ability to compete in the credit card market and gain profitable share today?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes. I think that -- it's -- we're basically static. Recently, I think we've been static with respect to outstandings share, generally, in the ballpark of static certainly not really gaining share in outstandings. This is -- and you're reason for it is correct, one's performance in outstandings is overwhelmingly driven by the choices one makes about the pursuit of high-balance revolver customers. And that is a marketplace we have tended to be more marginal participants in. And we're certainly not active participants in major parts of that marketplace. So any company's choice with respect to how they deal with high-balance revolvers, the purchase -- the pursuit of them and also the account management activities relative to that is going to swamp everything else. So because we, as kind of a centerpiece of our strategy, have -- are not as comfortable on a risk-adjusted basis with sort of price versus risk levels in that marketplace, we continue to be sort of nibbling around that more around the edges. And that dominates the kind of outstandings performance. Now we don't really operate with objectives about outstandings. We're fine shrinking, we're fine growing. We focus on the creation of net present value. And within that context, we're very, very pleased with what we're generating here is focusing on -- one thing is at the top of the market, the -- some of our products that you see featured on TV and our intense investment in the transactor space has worked great. And we're also very focused on finding customers who -- who's -- who are not intense balance-hungry customers, but who represent great, long-term customers. And that's a been our strategy for years, and I think it's worked very, very well. Now manifestations of this, of course, are that our purchase volume has been growing really at the top of the industry. While people don't generally publish account origination, the statistics, I think, we feel quite good about the account originations that are going on. But we're building kind of business the old-fashioned way. Customers who come on and build their balances slowly over time build their relationship with us over the years. And all the kind of health metrics, the whole level down in terms of our business and the percentage and the way the portfolio works and the lack of intense -- and the reduction in the intense kind of revolving nature of it is something we're very focused on.","Gary L. Perlin","And just -- it's Gary, Chris, I just want to add one small reminder to what Rich said in response to one of your comments. Which is if the industry is growing in low-single digits, we have low-single digits amount of runoff in our card business over the next year that we've talked about coming out of HSBC as some of those accounts go away. So in fact, if we end up at flat, we will also effectively have grown in that same sort of low-single digits, just a reminder of that. Thanks.","Operator","Next up is Donald Fandetti, Citi.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","One of the reasons I recall you buying the HSBC portfolio was for the private label business. And I was curious if you think there could be some deals that could come through that may sort of help you back-fill some of the runoff? And then secondarily, is there any risk to the rev margin? I know the portfolio was pretty concentrated in terms of retailers, in terms of renegotiating those contracts. Has that been done, and can you talk a little bit about that?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes. So first of all, about the private label business, we like the private label business. We have watched that business for a year. We mostly stayed on the sidelines because we were uncomfortable with the market clearing prices that the deals were going at. As the market got a lot more sensible in the wake of the Great Recession, obviously you've seen a lot of activity by Capital One. Our focus though is not on being big, although scale really matters, we have the threshold scale here. The key is to get partners that are healthy retailers, partners who have the right reason for doing the partnership business. And the right reason means they're very focused on using that partnership to build their franchise, and that leads to more positive selection. And finally, a contract that really can work for both parties. So we have a very selective strategy. And when we bought HSBC, they had a large number of partners. We were happy that we generally liked the mix of their partners. And I think they had avoided some of the mistakes that some players had in the industry of booking a number of partners that don't work out too well. But we've been able to already re-up with the majority of our major partners in that portfolio. Not all of them, but the majority of them. And we kind of go in one at a time and sitting down with them. But we very much like what has happened so far, and that has been successful. But both with respect to our existing contracts, when they come up for renewal and the pursuit of new ones, we will -- we're going to be all over that. But the key is we're going to be selective and we're going to make sure that we do this on terms that really work. So it's not a volume play, it's really a selective way to, I think, build business in a market that I think we're very well-positioned to capitalize on.","Jeff Norris","And Rich, in terms of the impact of the partnerships on the revenue margin?","Richard D. Fairbank","The impact of the partnerships on the revenue margin. The partnerships, certainly, generally lower our revenue margin. Our partnerships, and this is not a comment, by the way, on all private-label partnerships by any means, our partnerships tend to have lower losses and lower revenue margins. So to kind of -- rounding out to your earlier point, as HSBC's higher loss, some of their branded business, things like the old Metris book for example, some of that runs off. That will have a depressing impact on revenue margin as we talked about and tried to give some calibration on last quarter. The net-net effect of partnerships to us is lower revenue, lower losses.","Operator","Next up is David Hochstim of Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","[Audio Gap]","thing about the other segment, and I guess the other segment and the elimination of the trust-preferreds and the $60 million, is that a onetime benefit, or that's permanent benefit and should we continue to see sort of a $160 million loss in the other segments quarterly? And I have a follow-up before Jeff cuts me off.","Gary L. Perlin","Sure, David. First off, let me make sure we're clear on the impact of the calling of the TruPS. There's actually a onetime $60 million charge that will be booked in the first quarter. That's simply the acceleration of the amortization of the issuance costs related to that $3.6 billion of TruPS that we called. So that's going to affect noninterest income in the first quarter. Other than that, we will see the benefit of the reduction in interest cost. The average yield on the TruPS outstanding was about 8.6% on that $3.6 billion. As a result of the lower costs that we will have in terms of interest expense that does not get booked to any of our business segments and therefore shows up in other, I'd expect that to improve modestly, with both a lower funding cost and a larger investment portfolio, which I pointed to. But the other segment also carries a number of other things, especially some of the -- the tax benefits that we get from some of our investments that are booked into businesses and the offset is in other. But so I'd expect to see other kind of coming down, in a sense the treasury P&L coming a lot closer to breakeven because it won't be bearing this high-coupon debt.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then just could you share your thoughts about the dividends versus share repurchases. And that -- before the financial crisis, you were talking about a sort of 25% payout, I recall, is that sort of where we're headed again and is that something we could expect in 2013 if you're not returning any of that excess capital through share repurchases? And would we have to wait until 2014 to see share repurchases? Or is that something that could change in 2013 after the first capital plan?","Richard D. Fairbank","Well, David, we are -- the big elephant in the living room in a sense of Capital One's financial performance is we're generating an enormous amount of capital. And that is a -- the use of and distribution of that is a very central means by which we can create value. So what -- on the CCAR process, our focus was we obviously, given that we did not request share repurchases right off the bat, we've taken a somewhat conservative approach with the Federal Reserve. But we felt the best thing to do was to focus that request on dividends and get to a meaningful level of dividends. David, we're not going to pre- kind of quantify those numbers. But -- and then, beyond that, I think our focus is really going to be on share repurchases. And we believe that -- I don't want to get into specific kind of predictions about what happens in mid-seasonal kind of off-cycle things with the Fed, but I just think that we certainly see a big opportunity to generate a lot of excess capital here and an opportunity to deploy it over time beyond the meaningful dividend really through share repurchases.","Operator","Up next is Ken Bruce, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Appreciate all the commentary around the margin and I think that's helpful, but I do have one additional question. In the third quarter, you had quantified the franchise enhancements and the impact that, that would have on the revenue margin for U.S. Cards. I think it was, in total, about 50 basis points over the remainder of 2013. And I'm wondering if there are any adjustments to that, or if any of that was accelerated into the fourth quarter or if you could help reconcile just the quarter-over-quarter move in addition to the suppression impact on the margin, please?","Richard D. Fairbank","Ken, the story is exactly the same as we said before, and then we're still planning to move right along, plus or minus a few basis points here or there, the schedule that we released in the third quarter.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then separately on capital, you'd mentioned that the 8% would be achieved here in the not-too-distant future, and you'd alluded to possibly being conservative around how you think about capital. Is there an expectation to have a cushion above the 8%? Or how are you thinking about that?","Richard D. Fairbank","So we believe that -- no, look, we've taken a conservative view as we talked about with CCAR. And then we've talked about the Basel requirement. I think that the actual operating level of capital that we choose is not going to be driven by a precise number. It's going to be more of a feel thing. I think the term we used in our talking points was, look, you know Capital One, we're going to take a conservative bent. But nonetheless, we think that a central means of value creation is going to be the ability to distribute this capital. So our actual operating levels are really going to be driven by the growth opportunities that we see at the time. They're going to be driven by our view of the -- of the industry out there. It's not loss on us that the banking industry has managed to be pro-cyclical with how they have managed their capital, with some consequences that haven't worked out sometimes as well as expected. But we -- our basic view is a baseline kind of meaningful dividend, and you'll see where that thing goes as we go through the -- how the CCAR process comes out this year. And then the generation of an awful lot of capital, we'll look at the growth opportunities and requirements that we have, the nature of the marketplace, and we expect there will be a significant opportunity to do some share repurchases.","Operator","We'll now go to Daniel Furtado, Jefferies.","Daniel Furtado - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just had 2 clarifying questions. The first is when you talk about in subsequent iterations of the plan starting to be the source on the share repurchases, you're talking in essence about the '14 CCAR ask and beyond?","Gary L. Perlin","Dan, it's Gary. I mean, we're going to follow the process very carefully, look for the opportunities that are there, certainly wouldn't be later than '14. But we get to continually iterate our plan. And as Rich said, having gone from a couple of years of speaking with the Fed about raising capital to support our very compelling acquisitions, we're now switching to where much of the industry was a couple of years ago, which is looking for distribution. We\u2019re going to try and do that stepwise as reasonably fast as we can that's consistent with prudence and appropriate kind of regulatory conversations as well. So we'll see how that goes. But '14 will come, whether other opportunities come or not, we'll have to see.","Daniel Furtado - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then the second question is just more of a mechanical one to help me understand suppression a little bit. If something like recoveries were to decline or delinquencies go up, basically, in essence, negative moves on credit, that would, in turn, the response on suppression would be to suppress more revenue? Or is that the incorrect way to think about that?","Gary L. Perlin","Well, that's right, Dan. I mean, again, think of what's happening with suppression. We're dealing with the finance charges and fees, largely finance charges now. And we're going to see patterns that we'll follow in terms of collectibility there that, that will look somewhat like the collectibility that we are assessing with respect to principal that flows through the provisions. So in general direction, certainly, when credit is worse, we're going to be reversing more fees and finance charges, and we may be recovering less. But I think the question that you're really asking is about what might happen to our forward view of those things, which will tend to get captured early in the cycle through our finance charge and fee reserves just as you see during big moves in the credit cycle. You'll see our allowance move earlier and faster than the charge-offs themselves. But again, if we're going to be in a period of much more stable credit than we had seen several years ago, then you should see more stability in the suppression level as well. It also depends on how many fees and finance charges are actually being charged, as Rich said. So that will play into it as well.","Operator","Next comes from Bob Napoli, William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just wondered what interest level Capital One has in growing other fee-based businesses like prepaid, in particular? I mean, before the -- several years ago, you guys came very close to buying NetSpend, not saying you're revisiting that area. But the prepaid market has been growing pretty dramatically, and is that a business that Capital One should be in or are there any other areas of payments, fee-generated non-asset intensive types of businesses that make sense for Capital One?","Richard D. Fairbank","Bob, we did spend quite a bit of energy trying to be innovators in the prepaid space some years ago, and we learned a lot about that. I think the market that the prepaid -- that prepaid cards are serving is a growing market. I think we're going to primarily, though, get into that market in a different way. And that's, frankly, through our ING Direct business that is -- has a wonderful business model for folks looking for kind of a pretty simple way to, with good value, generate -- have your banking services. In fact in a business that I know, having lived it, the extraordinary complexity of how banking works. And I think it's just kind of electrifying how ING has created a really simplified way not only to do savings, which is where this all started, but frankly, really to do a checking business as well. So I think we'll be in that business in a slightly different way. And not to say -- and we'll also have prepaid cards as well. I appreciate your question about payments. We're not targeting another whole marketplace for payments, but I do think that's kind of related to the question that was earlier asked about what are we doing in the card business and why are the outstandings not growing that much. The card business is a -- really is, as we're -- the choices we're making in the card business are consistent with the choices we're making all across this company. And that is that we're increasingly focusing on transaction-based businesses. I think that the greatest things in banking, the best relationships, the greatest positive selection and the most enduring franchise building really comes from growing the hard-to-get primary banking relationships. And whether that's the checking account, whether it is -- the checking account, the credit card and especially the transactor credit card on the commercial side, the treasury management product, these are things that require a lot of energy and a fair amount of investment. They don't have glamorous results. But over time, these are, I think, really the key to building a great franchise. And that's why you'll see across Capital One an increasing emphasis on that. And over time, the results, I think, will really show.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And just a follow-up on the Auto Finance business, and 1 month is not a trend. But I mean, your growth slowed down a lot in December or in the quarter. I think you guys did point to a slowdown in growth in Auto Finance. But I mean, car sales seem to be pretty strong. What are your -- what is your feeling on that business? Are you going to continue -- have you pulled back or tightened credit at all? Was there a lot more competition? And I don't know if you could talk about subprime versus prime -- and what's -- if there's a lot of any different -- differences competitively going on in each sector?","Richard D. Fairbank","So Bob, we love the auto business. We've invested for years in this business. And we, over the past few years, we have continued in fact to really build strong relationships with our best dealers. By the way, I'll add that to the list of sort of building these kind of primary banking relationships where we've really, really kind of focused on the high-quality dealers and building much deeper relationships. But anyway, we have had a confluence in a business we love very much. There've been a confluence of several things that have led to, I think, performance levels that are -- will regress towards the mean at some point. But the confluence of things includes a number of competitors bailing out of the marketplace. It includes credit being very, very strong for the customers and the banks kind of who remained. And corresponding to that, I think, there was strength in pricing. And then, in addition to that, you have the supply and demand dynamics of the auto business, with car manufacturers pulling back, used car prices going to record levels. And all of these things happened at the same time that our business strategy involved continued geographic expansion, more expansion into the prime marketplace filling out our dealer relationships. And so our growth strategy overlaid on kind of a perfect storm in a good way with respect to the auto marketplace. Now all of those things are sort of reaching their kind of -- are going to go toward a more natural equilibrium over time. Competition has come in very significantly in both the prime and the subprime marketplace. Margins are returning more toward normal. They're in fact entirely back to normal, maybe on the slightly tighter side of normal on the -- in the prime marketplace and are certainly approaching normal in the subprime space. Underwriting, which got very tight in this perfect storm in kind of a good way. Underwriting is loosening. And as you know, I mean, we are obsessive about watching those things. Now where it is loosening so far is something that we can live with even if we don't chase it, and that is it is loosening a bit on term, i.e., how -- well, basically how long are the loans for. And it is loosening a bit on FICO, which really more means just you kind of -- more people extending down in the subprime space. It is held pretty firm on loan-to-value. And if it doesn't, you'll see more red flags being raised by Capital One. But so I, what -- the expectations I would like to set for you are that the market is getting back to normal. It is not -- I have a yellow flag on this market but not a red flag I would wave over that. And our own growth strategies are approaching sort of their natural maturation as well. So I think you -- we're going to continue to have a growth play here, a bit moderated and still a very strong business.","Operator","Up next is Sameer Gokhale of Janney Capital.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of them. Number one, to shift gears a little bit on to the Commercial Banking side of things, Rich, you've talked in the past about national lending scale on the card side. In Auto, I think you'd said, well, you're close to that. Commercial Lending, it seems like your footprint is relatively concentrated geographically in certain regions as I understand it, Northeast and then Texas, Louisiana, some in D.C. What is your outlook there? You've been growing at a nice kind of mid-teens clip, but are acquisitions potentially something you're contemplating in that business, or is that just something you think you can't really scale that up as much? So it's just whatever the organic growth rate is you'll go with that. And then the other unrelated question is on the credit card side. You talked about -- remaining focused on the transactor side of the business because that's really something where your analytics and your targeting can yield some benefits. But in this kind of environment, how about going further down the credit spectrum? I mean, I think 2\/3 of your card portfolio is prime, I think 1\/3 is subprime. Wouldn't it make sense to target maybe the subprime market to a greater extent if it's less competitive? How do you think about those things?","Richard D. Fairbank","Okay. Great questions, Sameer. Let me just take your credit card one first for a moment here. So yes, when I -- when you said I was talking about focusing on the transactor part of the segment, I don't want to leave an impression with anyone that we're only focusing on that. The way we look at the business is we look for the micro segments where we believe that we can generate well above hurdle rate returns, and also they have to be consistent with building a franchise in terms of the practices in the business and the way we can deliver to the customer. And that has led us to go from intensely -- intense activity in certain micro segments and absolutely nothing in others. We -- the mix of business that we pursued before the great recession is strikingly just about the same as what we're pursuing now. And on the transactor front, it's been an intense pursuit. On the revolver front, it is really kind of one customer and one micro segment at a time, looking at where -- how does price compared with the -- what we really feel a risk-adjusted -- the stress-based risk of that business is, and we find pockets within revolver. One thing we have said that the really kind of really balance-intensive revolver where -- tend to think things are a little out of equilibrium and pricing versus risk in that segment. Why not do more subprime than we do? I think we make the choices that we do based on choosing the customers in that segment that I think have the -- would fulfill the characteristics I just talked about. There's many, many, many customers out there in subprime that we're not able to deliver a credit product to. But I think that we have found our natural kind of group set of segments, and I think you'll see more stability out of that. Not that we're trying not to innovate, it's just that I think we've learned quite a bit about risk and return, and I think we've found the pockets that work for us.","Jeff Norris","Oh, in commercial.","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, commercial is a -- commercial is generally on the C&I side and it is a kind of a local business. It's all about local presence. And that's why you find most of the C&I players that correspond very, very closely with their branch footprint. That generally applies also to CRE, even though I don't think the linkage actually to a branch footprint is nearly as technically as significant on CRE because it's not a transaction -- there's not as much of a transactional and cash management kind of component to that. But it's still...","[Audio Gap]","C&I business where you need a lot of scale in order to be in those businesses. And our energy business is an example that came out of our deep experience in that, from high burning down in the South. But we are building a number of verticals in the specialty financial -- specialty banking sector. And those verticals really are -- can be national in scope and they're not really about having a local banking relationship. So we'll end up as the kind of a hybrid of a national and a local player on the commercial side. But I think net-net, overall, there's quite a bit of growth opportunity for Capital One in the near- and longer-term future.","Operator","And that will come from Bill Carcache of Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Rich, I was hoping to just go back to the -- revisit the point that you made about the transaction businesses. And Capital One certainly has enjoyed very strong purchase volume growth, but what's your -- how should we think about the corresponding revenue growth, which has been much slower? When we look at the composition of your revenues, you still have 80% of your revenues coming from spread, and so the growth and the emphasis on the fee-based businesses, I can see that and the attractiveness of that. But in terms of it really moving the needle, I guess what are your thoughts in terms of, to date, are you satisfied with not just the purchase volume growth but the bottom-line revenue growth after factoring in the rewards cost and all that, that it's taken to drive that volume growth? And then going forward, do you expect -- what are your expectations relative to what we've seen so far?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes. Well, the -- as you can imagine, the way that we look at that business is, really, the way we look at all our businesses is to take a -- to strategically look at the marketplace, study the competition and the inherent risk and rewards in that space and then take a very disciplined net present value based look at every tranche of business and really make sure that we're getting paid for what we do. So we're not wishing upon a star in this highly competitive top-of-the-market business. We know it's something that you can't go do one little test sell and find it works because you got to be a player in that business. It's about brand, it's about credibility, and it's about building a great customer experience. So we have invested in that space, and we like the financial returns in that space. This is one of these things that it's expensive to build an account and they tend to have a very long lives, and so it's kind of a slower payback business. So you're right, that it's not something that is really grabbing hold of the metrics and moving the needle in a short-term way. But rest assured that we are very disciplined with respect to net present value based, real kind of returns from this kind of investments. Now -- but the other thing that's going on with Capital One is we're mostly doing the same things that we've been doing for years in the card business. And the kind of sub-story beneath it, I suppose, is one that I would call a kind of a bit of a movement to quality, if you will, in terms of just, even away from the top-of-the-market very heavy spenders, just more of a move toward the more long-lasting sort of less-intense revolver based and kind of more of building -- all the building and incenting the customers and the behaviors that really lead to a better franchise over time. And I think that one of the things that has pressured revenue is just that part of that has been letting a little bit of air out of the revenue model as we have moved more and more to try to get to and well beyond where the industry is in terms of really an unassailable set of practices. And also investing to -- customer experience, to make these long-lasting relationships. One thing that has also happened in here, we are at record-low attrition levels at Capital One. They have steadily gone down for years is the direct byproduct of our investment here. But rest assured, we're still very focused on good old lending and making money as well there. And I think the stability of our revenue margin -- funny thing is if you look back, Bill, at our revenue margin before the CARD Act, that thing is so -- even way back then and where it is now, after all the changes, even when we kept, in fact, telling you, \"Look, it's going down, it's going down,\" and it didn't even go down as much as we thought it was. The preparations we made pre-CARD Act over the years to put ourselves in a position that would -- way before we knew the CARD Act was coming, I think certainly helped. And I think the power of our \"one customer at a time\" information-based strategy has allowed us to generate sustainably strong revenue margins, even while we are continuing to slowly but surely transform our company toward a more transactor base and more industry-leading kind of customer experience company.","Operator","And our final question today will come from Mike Taiano of Telsey Advisory Group.","Michael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","So just one question I had on the pre-provision earnings run rate guidance. So the fourth quarter $2.369 billion, so if you -- I just want to make sure I'm getting it right that you annualize that, but then you have to adjust for the higher expenses in the quarter. So my math seems to equate to about a $10.1 billion annualized pre-provision earnings number, is that seem about right?","Gary L. Perlin","Well, Mike, I can't get into specific guidance. We are trying to give you some transparency here. And yes, I would absolutely take into account the comments about the seasonally high noninterest expense, including marketing, and make a small adjustment there. Revenue, although Rich described, that that's going to move up and down in various quarters because of the seasonality in the card business. This quarter tends to be pretty close to average. So I think that should give you the parts and pieces you need to kind of get to a reasonable number. But I think you're looking at it the right way.","Michael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Okay. And just one quick follow-up. One of your competitors, actually Chase, had provided disclosure in their earnings about the amount of card acquisition -- or new accounts that they're acquiring online. It was a pretty -- I was surprised, it increased to over 50% from the 30s last year. Are you guys seeing a similar trajectory? And how -- does that have a potentially positive impact on your costs going forward?","Richard D. Fairbank","Mike, we -- I don't have in front of me the -- our own data on new accounts online. But I -- we are seeing -- there is a very significant shift going on away from the Pony Express, if you will, of direct mail to the new world of online. It is -- in many ways, it's a migration. It depends on the particular customer segment and the product that one is marketing here. But I will say it is striking. If you look at mail volume, mail volume has dropped, I don't have the number right in front of me, but something like 30% to 40% from last year. And I think 2 effects are going on there. I think the card industry underestimated, when it kind of rushed back into the market, underestimated how weak the demand was. And so I think there's a pullback there. But I think it's also a manifestation of the fact that so many of us are finding a growing and very significant part of our business really coming from online. I think that augers incredibly well over time for some of the potential benefits of -- it's not just cost, although that's a key thing. But I think always, we find our customer experience metrics are best along the -- in the online channel. Things like compliance and rigorous highly accurate execution tends to work best in online channels. Capital One is committed to being a leader on -- with respect to this very significant game changing phenomenon.","Jeff Norris","Okay, well thank you, everyone, for joining us on this conference call today.

Scott?","Scott Blackley","Thanks, Jeff. I will begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $5.5 billion or $11.05 per diluted common share in 2019. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were $12.09 for 2019. In the fourth quarter, net income was $1.2 billion or $2.25 per share. Net of adjusting items, our EPS in the quarter was $2.49 per share.","We had three adjusting items in the quarter which are outlined on Slide 14 of our earnings presentation. First, we had a $48 million or $0.08 per share expense of launch and integration costs associated with our Walmart partnership. This brings the full year total expense to $211 million and concludes the one-time expenses related to the Walmart partnership launch. Additionally, we had an allowance reserve build for the acquired Walmart portfolio of $84 million or $0.13 per share. The reserve build as well as the launch and integration costs are recorded in our domestic card business. Lastly, we had $23 million of charges related to the cyber incident that we announced at the end of July. These charges were partially offset by an insurance reimbursement receivable of $7 million resulting in a net impact of $16 million or $0.03 per share. We continue to expect a portion of these charges in insurance recoveries will extend beyond 2019.","In addition to the adjusting items, we recognized $31 million in costs related to the redemption of our Series C and D preferred stock on December 2. We also had an incremental $17 million of dividend expense associated with the cost of carrying the new Series I issuance in addition to Series C and D for most of the quarter. Collectively, these costs decreased Q4 earnings per share by $0.10. As a reminder, preferred dividends impact EPS, but they do not impact net income.","Moving on to quarterly performance relative to year ago, adjusted pre-provision earnings increased 17%, with revenue increasing 7%, operating expenses increasing 4% and marketing decreasing by 15%. Compared to the prior year quarter, provision for credit losses increased 11% owing to a larger allowance build and a modest increase in charge-offs. Let me take a moment to discuss the quarterly movements in our allowance across our businesses which are detailed in Table 8 of our earnings supplement. Our card business on allowance build of $107 million, essentially flat outside of the $84 million initial allowance reserve build for the acquired Walmart portfolio. In our consumer business, there was a build of $31 million driven by continued growth in our auto business. And lastly, reserves in our commercial business declined by $4 million as charge-offs in the quarter more than offset builds in allowance related to our energy portfolio.","December 31, 2019 marked the end of the allowance accounting that we have all known for decades. We estimate that the 1\/1\/2020 adoption of CECL will increase our allowance by approximately $2.9 billion and reduce our CET1 ratio by 16 basis points in the first quarter. We have broken out the CECL allowance transition impacts by reported segment on Slide 4.","Turning to Slide 5, net interest margin was 6.95% in the quarter and 6.83% for the full year of 2019. Relative to the prior quarter, net interest margin was largely flat. On a linked quarter basis, net interest margin increased 22 basis points or 14 basis points excluding the negative impact in Q3 from UK PPI. The 14 basis points of improvement, was partly driven by asset mix, including the on-boarding of the Walmart portfolio in the quarter, which reduced cash and securities and partly by the effects of seasonal loan growth. We continue to have a relatively neutral near-term posture, the interest rate changes. Over the longer term, persistently low interest rates will be a headwind for us and the industry.","Turning to Slide 6, I will cover capital. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis this quarter was 12.2%. In the fourth quarter, we purchased approximately $941 million or $10 million Capital One common shares. We have now completed approximately $1.4 billion of our 2019 CCAR authorization of $2.2 billion. Recall that in October, the Fed finalized the tailoring rule with an expected implementation in the first quarter of 2020. When we adopt the rule, we expect to opt out of AOCI for regulatory capital purposes. As a result, on December 31, we transferred our held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale resulting in an AOCI increase of approximately $890 million. Inclusive of this transfer, our December 31 AOCI position for AFS securities increased CET1 in the fourth quarter by about 30 basis points. Accordingly, when we opt out of AOCI in the first quarter, Q1 2020 CET1 will decrease by about 30 basis points all else equal.","As we are preparing for CCAR 2020, we still believe that our long-term capital need is around 11% CET1. Let me take a minute to talk about the factors impacting our capital need. In the 2019 CCAR, the Fed\u2019s implementation of the new card loss model created a headwind to our capital under stress. Conversely, the effects of the recently finalized tailoring rule will provide a tailwind to our capital reduction under stress. We also believe there is an opportunity for further capital relief under the stress capital buffer framework and we continue to keep an eye on the Fed\u2019s implementation of CECL which will occur in CCAR 2022. How and when the Fed implements these changes in CCAR will be a key factor in when we will be able to manage our CET1 closer to the 11% long-term capital need.","With that, let me turn the call over to Rich. Rich?","Richard Fairbank","Thanks, Scott. I will begin on Slide 9 which summarizes fourth quarter results for our credit card business. The credit card business delivered solid results with stable credit and strong growth in loans, purchase volume and revenue. Credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic card business, which is shown on Slide 10.","Domestic card ending loan balances increased by $11.3 billion or 10.5% year-over-year driven by the addition of the acquired Walmart portfolio and strong growth of branded cards partially offset by our choice to exit several small partnership portfolios in the second quarter. Branded card loans, which exclude all private label and co-branded cards, grew 5.7% from the prior year quarter. Domestic card average loans for the quarter were up 9.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. We posted another strong quarter of purchase volume growth as we continued to grow our heavy spender franchise. Year-over-year, domestic card purchase volume growth was 10.7%. Net interchange revenue for the total company grew 9.2%. Revenue increased 7.2% from the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by the growth in average loans. Revenue margin declined 31 basis points. More than 100% of the decline was driven by the revenue sharing agreement on the acquired Walmart portfolio.","Not-interest expense was essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter. Domestic card credit remains strong and stable. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 4.32%, a 32 basis point improvement year-over-year driven by the addition of the acquired Walmart portfolio. Because the delinquency rate is not affected by the loss-sharing agreement, the addition of the Walmart portfolio put upward pressure on the fourth quarter 30 plus delinquency rate. Despite this upward pressure, the 30 plus delinquency rate improved 11 basis points from the end of the prior year quarter to 3.93%. Pulling up, our domestic card business continued to deliver strong results with top line growth and strong and stable credit.","Slider 11 summarizes fourth quarter results for our consumer banking business. Ending loans increased 6.5% year-over-year. Average loans for the fourth quarter grew 5.5% from the prior year quarter. Our auto business delivered strong year-over-year originations growth and a modest acceleration of loan growth, along with stable credit results and loan yields all in a market place with increasing competitive intensity. Digital innovation is the key driver of our momentum in the auto business. Powered by our national banking strategy, ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $14.5 billion or 7.3% year-over-year. Average deposit interest rate for the quarter increased 10 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. The rate increase was primarily a result of the product mix shift toward higher rate deposit products throughout the year. The deposit interest rate declined 11 basis points from the sequential quarter driven by the market interest rate environment. Our average deposit rate paid going forward will depend on several factors, including the market interest rate environment, our deposit mix, our funding needs and competitive dynamics.","Consumer banking revenue decreased 1.8% from the fourth quarter of last year. Underlying revenue growth from higher auto loans and retails deposits was more than offset by two effects. Differences in the timing of Federal Reserve rate cuts versus our deposit pricing moves pressured revenue in the fourth quarter and the fourth quarter of 2018 included a small tail of revenue from the legacy home loans and investing businesses. There was no revenue from these legacy businesses in the fourth quarter of this year.","Non-interest expense was up 2.3%. Volume driven growth in expenses and our continuing investments to grow and transform were partially offset by the lack of expenses form the legacy businesses. Fourth quarter provision for credit losses increased $32 million year-over-year. Auto loan growth drove an allowance build. The auto charge-off rate improved 8 basis points compared to the prior year quarter to 1.90%. Better than expected auction values and the benign economy continue to support strong auto credit. We continue to expect that the annual auto charge-off rate will gradually increase as the cycle plays out.","Moving to Slide 12, I will discuss our commercial banking business. Ending loan balances were up 5.9% year-over-year. Quarterly average loan balances were up 6.5% compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. Average deposits increased 4.4%. Fourth quarter revenue was up 7.5% from the prior year quarter driven by growth in average loan balances and strong non-interest income. Non-interest expense was up 1.6% compared to the prior year quarter. Provision for credit losses increased compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by our energy portfolio. The commercial banking charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was 0.35% and criticized loan rates were relatively stable compared to both the prior year and sequential quarters. The criticized performing loan rate for the fourth quarter was 2.9% and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.6%. In our commercial banking business, we are keeping a watchful eye on market conditions. Unregulated competitors continue to put pressure on pricing, loan spreads and loan terms. Against that backdrop, we are carefully choosing our spots and staying disciplined in our underwriting and origination choices.","Pulling way up, in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2019, Capital One continued to post solid results as we invest to grow and to drive our digital transformation. Our marketing investments continue to build momentum across our businesses. In domestic card, we generated strong year-over-year growth in purchase volume and solid growth in loans. Credit results were strong and stable and we successfully launched the Walmart partnership. In consumer banking, our auto business delivered solid loan growth with stable credit and loan yields and our national banking strategy achieved strong year-over-year growth in retail deposits.","Looking ahead, marketing will as always depend upon our continuous assessment of opportunities in the competitive marketplace. As we enter 2020, we continue to see resilient growth opportunities in all of our businesses and will have a full year of marketing for the new Walmart partnership. With the momentum we have in domestic cards and national retail banking plus the incremental Walmart marketing, we expect full year 2020 marketing expense will be moderately higher than full year 2019 marketing expense. We remain all-in on our technology transformation and our progress continues. We are realizing significant and growing benefits across the company, faster to market, better products, better customer experience, better risk management, more growth, better economics. We are on the home stretch of our transition to the cloud and we are on track to exit our data centers near the end of this year. Until then, we continue to operate with one foot in the legacy data center environment and one foot in the cloud. Along the way, we are working hard to improve operating efficiency even with the elevated cost of straddling both the data center and cloud environments.","In 2019, we posted a 45 basis point improvement in annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments and we expect to achieve another year of modest improvement in 2020. We continue to expect a bigger move down in annual operating efficiency ratio to 42% in 2021 net of adjustments. We expect the larger improvement in 2021 to be aided by the full exit of the data centers and the associated costs of straddling two environments, increased traction in our businesses enhanced by technology and the step up in revenue share on the acquired Walmart portfolio which will occur in the fourth quarter of 2020. We continue to expect that the improvement in annual operating efficiency ratio will drive significant improvement in annual total efficiency ratio by 2021 as well. As the many benefits from our technology transformation continue and increase, we are well positioned to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create long-term shareholder value.","Now, Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourselves to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any additional follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Matt, please start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good evening guys.","Richard Fairbank","Good evening, Ryan.","Ryan Nash","Hey, Rich. Maybe just to start off a question for Scott, so thank you for the moving pieces on CECL across the different products, I guess, now that Day 1 is behind us, any color you can give us regarding the Day 2 impact? And maybe can you just talk about it across each of the different portfolio? And I have one follow-up.","Scott Blackley","Yes. Sure. Well, when I think about Day 2, I am going to start off by just saying we gave segment level multiples and I think they are a good foundation for you to use those multiples and apply them to what you would have been estimating under the prior regime for allowance builds in 2020. So I think that\u2019s in general a good place to start in terms of thinking about Day 2. I think that the multiple that we have talked about could change gradually if performance \u2013 the portfolio performance or the portfolio mix really changes in the future, but I think those are going to be changes that happen over time. So the transition multiples are probably a good place to start.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And Rich, maybe just a question on both operating and overall efficiency, so you made nice progress in 2019 despite a handful of headwinds, I guess what are the biggest rate factors that could impact reaching 42 or is it the fact that everything is coming offline in the fourth quarter that you have such a high degree of confidence? And then I guess second just given where we are in the cycle, you talked about marketing being up moderately this year, is there some area where you could see it accelerating or would you expect it to remain in and around these levels plus or minus like you articulated in your outlook? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","So, Ryan, let\u2019s talk about the operating efficiency ratio. We are, like a year into when we set this guidance and it was certainly a stepping out of character for Capital One to be so specific of so many years out. And as we have talked all along the way, there are several things that have driven our confidence. There are certain things that are, could call the math is a little bit understating the sort of incredible work associated with doing it, but in a sense, getting out of the data centers is something that with the extraordinary achievement of doing it, we have, I think a very good handle on what the cost of what\u2019s straddling those environments have been and what the benefit of just being all in on the cloud is. The math of the Walmart step up that is what it is, that\u2019s contractual. And so I think that\u2019s a very reliable thing. Another thing that aids the continued improvement here and the larger improvement in 2021 is the increased traction that we expect in our businesses that we can in fact see unfolding and that we expect to continue. Obviously, that has uncertainty around it like any estimated future businesses performance and growth, but a lot of that is sort of in the works. It can be affected by changes in the marketplace, changes in the economy, changes in choices that we make, but this is the product of the bunch of work that we have been doing, the success of our marketing and account origination in prior years which we have spent lot of time talking about and some of the technology innovation that has been going on. So, we feel good about that. Obviously, that has uncertainty to it.","And the other element in the uncertainty equation is what happens to operating cost of 1 minus the data center exit and all the associated cost of straddling that will be eliminated. And there can always be risk to cost estimates, but we have spent \u2013 we have worked very hard and this is not like a new thing, we worked hard for years driving \u2013 gradually driving down the efficiency ratio and being very disciplined on operating cost. We do have some growing benefit that comes on the technology side here with respect to technology cost savings and collectively, when we put all that together, well as always there is uncertainty in this. Here we are, we had our bold shingle that we hung out a year ago. Here we are a year into it and we feel as good as we did at the time that we launched it. And I am pretty struck by in a world where so many things change how \u2013 what we had in mind is continuing to unfold and that\u2019s because it\u2019s the product of the lot of work for a long period of time.","With respect to marketing, the first thing I want to say is we don\u2019t give precise in most years, in many ways, we don\u2019t even give marketing guidance at all. And what I would say about marketing is in the impression I want to leave you with is we continue to feel very good about our marketing investments. We \u2013 in card, marketing is strengthening our heavy spender franchise driving strong new account originations, growth in purchase volume, net interchange revenue, loans on the bank side, the increased marketing is fueling deposit growth along with cafe and brand awareness. We are seeing a lot of traction just overall in our brand metrics and brand equities that are critical to building a franchise. And also we are a company that doesn\u2019t have 6,000 branches we are a company that actually isn\u2019t at the top of the lead table in terms of co-brand partnerships and a lot of things. So, we have to build our business the old fashioned way kind of one customer at the time and our marketing machine is a key part of that. So, what I would leave you with is we continue to feel very good about the marketing. We got a new addition here in terms of the full year of the Walmart marketing. And so that\u2019s going to be yet another factor that pulls up the numbers there. There is always \u2013 we will always make our final determinations based on the opportunities and necessities that we see in the marketplace, but I wanted to just give you that general window into how we are feeling about the marketing.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on the Day 2 CECL impact, Scott. When you look at the Street consensus provisions out there and I am just looking at our own, we are assuming 6%ish loan growth flat charge-offs and we have the provision up 20%. I mean, does that look commensurate to sort of what you are articulating or is this something else?","Scott Blackley","Sanjay, why don\u2019t I just step back and give you little bit of a picture of what\u2019s going to happen with CECL? So, just to go back and ground out how CECL is going to work. Allowance movements under CECL are really driven by the same factors that drove the allowance under the prior regime. So, you start off with loan balances at the end of the period, you have got expected future losses and recoveries on balances and then we have qualitative factors that are not captured in our modeling and we have those on top. Of those three factors, it\u2019s really the second one that changes under CECL and because we are now going to be holding an allowance for the expected lifetime losses. And importantly we are also going to be having the lifetime recoveries and that\u2019s \u2013 I will come to that in just a minute as to why that\u2019s such an important factor. So that\u2019s the biggest step change under CECL. So, let me kind of just put this together for you and tell you how we are going to do it. We start with a 12-month loss outlook which we forecast. We then extend that into a lifetime forecast and when we do that we assume a gradual reversion of losses to historical averages after that first year. And then we overlay that with future recoveries and future recoveries are a big offset to our CECL allowance. Prior to CECL we offset our allowance with expected recoveries for only the next 12 months. With CECL, we will be offsetting our allowance with all estimated future recoveries. And relatively speaking, recoveries have a larger offsetting impact under CECL than they did under the prior allowance regime, because we tend to see a longer tail of recoveries on our charge-offs. So, net of all of that, I think you are going to see a 1.42 multiple on our allowance in our domestic card business at the point of transition, 1.49 multiple for our auto business. And as I mentioned in my first answer, I think those are relatively stable.","Your question about, well, how might this look in periods of stability and in periods of growth, let me just kind of answer that real quick. In periods of stability, you are really just going to have take that multiple and apply it to whatever allowance build that you are thinking about and that includes moderate growth and a stable economy. There is a couple of things that could cause that implied CECL multiple to vary over time. And let me give you a couple of examples. So the first is that as you know and we have talked about CECL pulls forward the allowance expense associated with new lending. And so all else equal, our implied CECL multiple would probably go up in periods of higher growth. And just to give you a bit of sensitivity there, during our growth surge in 2014 and 2015, the implied multiple during that period if we had lived under CECL would have been higher perhaps in the 1.6 range. So just to give you a sense like there is a lot of things that could move around that if we just kind of took hindsight and applied kind of where we see things we can see the multiple going up into that range. On the flipside of that in periods of high recoveries, you could actually see the multiple go down. So in periods immediately after a downturn where there is higher \u2013 we have got this big portfolio of recoveries, those might actually start to be a bigger factor and push the ultimate multiple down. So I know that was a bit of a long answer, but hopefully that gives you a sense of kind of the moving pieces of how CECL is going to work Day 2.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Alright. Thank you. I have one follow-up. Just on the Walmart portfolio, I know it was known to have a lower tender share penetration. I was wondering if that\u2019s a big growth opportunity in 2020 and a contributor to card growth. And then just a clarification on the marketing expense outlook for 2020, would this year\u2019s growth be moderately higher sort of that \u2013 was that a good comparison in terms of the growth rate? Thank you.","Richard Fairbank","Could you repeat the second question, Sanjay, your clarification question?","Sanjay Sakhrani","Yes. On the marketing expense growth, you mentioned moderately higher, I was just wondering if 2019\u2019s growth rate would be commensurate with moderately higher in terms of like mid single-digits growth?","Scott Blackley","Okay. So I think what we have this year is a continuation of the momentum that we had last year. And I want to say also to my response to Ryan Nash\u2019s opening question that one of the important drivers of 42% is the continuing traction in the business and marketing is a very important element of that. And in fact \u2013 so a way to think about it is we start with an opportunity in a sense a growing opportunity on the marketing side consistent with what we are seeing overlay that with Walmart which is a new thing. And those two things together is what is driving our guidance of a moderate increase in marketing. Rich, do you want to talk about this question on the growth opportunity from \u2013 growth opportunity in the Walmart portfolio? Yes, let me say it\u2019s certainly an honor and an opportunity to partner with not only the world\u2019s largest retailer actually the world\u2019s largest company, Fortune 1 company and to launch a digital first card program. So for Capital One, the opportunity divides itself into a back book where we have converted the old Synchrony back book and we have told you a lot about the size and the general parameters associated with that. And then there will over time be a growing front book that will be the originations that we do under this new partnership. We are not going to be specifically guiding to that front book, because in many ways this will have a lot of similarity to many of the front book things that we do at Capital One. Certainly, the size of the Walmart and at this point, relative to other partnerships the penetration levels of the credit card relationships, there is certainly upside there and I think Walmart certainly believes that and so do we. But we are in the very early stages of this, but I think we are very pleased with the way our two companies are partnering here.","Jeff Norris","Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","And your next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks. You referred to a 5.7% growth in the branded cards that I think was the same number that you referenced in the third quarter, so roughly the same level as growth. Could you just talk a little bit about what the kind of the outlook is? I mean, because that does exclude Walmart, so talk a little bit about whether that branded growth is going to be accelerating or decelerating and the impact maybe on overall growth from Walmart? And I do have a follow-up.","Richard Fairbank","Yes, Moshe, so first of all, the front book of \u2013 since it starts at zero the front book by definition will be a growing book. I also want to point out the back book of Walmart with the loss rate that it has is a runoff portfolio that\u2019s running off at a pretty sizable clip relative to portfolios otherwise that we have. So, there are going to be two forces going in opposite directions there and we will have to see how that plays out, but we are certainly very happy to have that partnership. The outlook, look I think we continue to feel good about the growth opportunities in the card business, but I think it\u2019s more a continuation of the story that we have been talking about before in terms of we are benefited by a number of years of strong account origination. We have been over time increasing credit lines as we have validated each successive vintage. It\u2019s coming in as good as it is and in fact if anything, the recent vintages are outperforming in a good way by a bit some of the earlier vintage. So all that is good that gives us the confidence to continue to drive the originations and also the continuing confidence on the credit line side. This is all in the context of an economy that\u2019s already the longest in length in recorded history here between recessions. So with a cautious eye at the environment, the things that we have been talking about for a number of quarters are continuing to find traction and then very important element of that is the success of the marketing. So, that\u2019s why we feel good about the growth opportunity.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. And just as a follow-up, little bit of housekeeping, non-interest income outside of interchange revenue and service fees kind of that other line was up very nicely both from the third quarter and a year ago. Was that primarily just the change in the absence of the PPI charge or are there other factors as well?","Scott Blackley","Moshe, can you just \u2013 which specific line item are you looking at?","Moshe Orenbuch","What you guys have called kind of other income, it was up like 55%, 60% of Q3 and 90% or so from a year ago, but I believe both of those had the PPI charges in them?","Scott Blackley","Yes. So, a few things that impact that line item, so other non-interest income really is driven by oftentimes marks on, on a variety of different situations. So, the first is we actually have some compensation-related assets that we mark and we take the benefit of those marks runs through this line item in revenue and there is an offsetting expense that runs through and elevates FCNB. So in the period with the run-up in the market, there was a pretty healthy amount of mark on compensation. The other thing that runs through there we do occasionally have partner payments that are coming in under the contracts. Those can run through there and be a bit lumpy. I think that the level that you are seeing in Q4 is a bit elevated to what I would expect on a run-rate basis.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good evening.","Richard Fairbank","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Just switching gears a little bit talking about NIM, I know that NIM went up nicely in the quarter, which I think you had a comment in your prepared remarks around how lower rates are little bit of a headwind. So I just wanted to square those two things and understand how you are thinking about the outlook for NIM, you had a nice decline in the deposit costs, maybe if you could speak to that a little bit?","Scott Blackley","Betsy, as I mentioned last quarter, we have been talking for a number of quarters about headwinds from deposit mix and deposit pricing and we have started to see those abate a little bit last quarter. When I look at NIM this quarter, I mentioned that there were two primary factors that drove NIM up on a linked quarter basis. One of those was asset mix which was the larger of the two factors that I described. The other factor was seasonal loan growth. So we are seeing a bit of that traction in there. The deposit pricing is embedded in that as well as things like accelerated amortization on the premiums that we have, some of the securities, all of that\u2019s embedded in there. So overall, I think that when it comes to the impact of deposit pricing our betas have been relatively low since the declining rate cycle started that maybe an opportunity. Rich mentioned the types of factors that would drive where deposit pricing goes. So I think we will have to see where that moves to, but at this point, I don\u2019t really see any outsized impactors whether positively or negative on our net interest margin.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then so mix really driving the buzz on that, when I think about the CECL outlook here and I know you have already talked about Day 2 quite a bit, I just wanted to see if you could give us some color around the commercial banking increase in your Day 1. I ask just because some of the other folks we look at had declines in commercial. So I want to understand what was driving a little bit of a different outcome for you?","Scott Blackley","It is so hard for me to judge what others are doing on their estimates. It depends on the life, a variety of factors. So, I can\u2019t even hazard a guess when it comes to commercial just because the portfolios are pretty different. So, I really honestly don\u2019t have an answer to you on that one.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please.","Operator","And your next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think we would all agree that a $100 loan balance on January 1 after the holidays would have a different repaying behavior than a $100 loan balance on May 1 after tax refunds are distributed. I realize from a CECL perspective you are supposed to take lifetime loss assumptions on both. But I am trying to understand how does the practical difference in terms of that near-term repayment behavior impact your lifetime loss reserve? And said slightly differently, is 5% growth in December the same as 5% growth in June?","Scott Blackley","Rick, I would just say that seasonal growth and transactors we look at those, we look at the likelihood of revolving we use historical empirical data about how quickly those get paid down. They don\u2019t tend to have large lifetime allowances and in general I would say those aren\u2019t really a factor that\u2019s driving the multiples that we disclosed.","Rick Shane","Got it. So as a follow-up to that, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to see that same seasonality, because you are able to factor in, in the short-term the repayment behaviors?","Scott Blackley","Yes, broadly speaking, all else equal, I think that\u2019s true.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And your next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","Yes, Rich, there has been a lot of talk in the banking and payments industry about B2B and Capital One is a top three small business card issuer. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamic there and what your thoughts are in terms of growth and is that growing faster than your consumer business?","Richard Fairbank","So our small business, we don\u2019t break that out separately. As we are in the consumer side, one of the top players in the lead table in that particular space AmEx is way north of the rest of us unlike the shorter distance between competitors on the consumer side, but that business is a business that is a simple extrapolation \u2013 a simple transfer of a consumer approach or a lift and shift of a commercial approach ends up being a suboptimal thing. And the traction and success we have gotten in the small business space comes from really working backwards from the customer and the customer needs over a very, very long period of time. And so a lot of the underlying dynamics are the same in that business in terms of the shift in payments, the reduction in cash and checks and so on. But what I would leave you with is like our some of the other investments we have made at Capital One, this is many years kind of in the making and we are continuing to generate successful growth there. The one thing I would say is that on both the consumer side and certainly the small business and the commercial side, the change that is going on in payments is breathtaking. I think it\u2019s really at the vortex of technology change in all of banking and that\u2019s partly because the digitization of transactions is a very natural place to go, but it\u2019s also one of the places that is not regulated or it\u2019s very lightly regulated. And furthermore it is the place where many tech companies who really don\u2019t want to be carrying around bank holding company badges and things like that focused on how they can try to win on the front end of banking and leave a lot of the back end of banking to the banks. So I am excited by the opportunity on the business side as well as the consumer side, but I\u2019m certainly struck by the breathtaking rate of change. And I think for every player in the business, there is a real imperative to come up with a strategy and work backwards from where the world is going instead of forward from where we are.","Jeff Norris","Do you have a follow-up, Don?","Don Fandetti","Nope, I am all set.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","Next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Afternoon. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Just not looking for guidance, but just thinking conceptually long-term, it would seem logical that you could do more digital customer aggregation with the digital bank in place. Was that \u2013 is it fair to think that customer acquisition costs, the costs tied to physical mailings and so forth may be more efficient going forward?","Richard Fairbank","Wait, I want to make sure, John, could you explain a little bit more of your question again?","John Hecht","It\u2019s just you guys have invested a lot more to digital banking platform and it\u2019s clear to us that as a user of your website you can do more online. And so the question is given that your consumers can do more online, are there cross-selling opportunities, are there other opportunities to reduce your customer acquisition costs for a specific product?","Richard Fairbank","Yes. So from the \u2013 interestingly from the founding notion of this company, one of the founding notions was that marketing is going to be reinvented by the technology and information revolution. And so, way back with old fashion direct mail, we set out to build the business and we also didn\u2019t have \u2013 it was by being very small, we didn\u2019t have much of a cross-sell opportunity. So much of the heritage of the company for a long period of time was focused on the origination of business. And one of the great prizes that awaited us over time was to have a scale franchise and there are two parts to that. One is to really be large, but the other is to be a franchise. And if you overlay the whole digital revolution on that, I want to redouble your point that I think the opportunity that awaits the companies who bring three things to the table is extraordinary. One is the table stake is you really need to be large and however important scale was in the past, it is more important everyday and I believe it was very important in the past. The second thing that one needs to bring to the table is great digital capability and that\u2019s not just in terms of nice apps and that kind of thing, but also the information based capabilities which increasingly are very benefited by real-time big data and the use of machine learning. So there is a great opportunity there. That\u2019s the second leg of the stool if you will, but I really, really, what we believe at the outset and what we certainly live every day is there is a third leg of the stool and that is that you have to have a loyal customer franchise. Just having eyeballs lying around just having a large customer base, it\u2019s nice, but the nonlinear things that happen when there is a deep and loyal franchise is a great thing. If you look at the essence of Capital One strategy over all of these years, we started with nothing and have spent years and years in the quest for scale. Secondly, we have started with an information-based strategy many years ago and really \u2013 and that was again pre-Internet and all of that, but where we have come over time the whole tech transformation driving toward great digital capability and real-time machine learning big data capability. And then finally and maybe of all of them this is the hardest one to build is really building that loyal customer franchise, which is all about a great customer experience, products that people can rely on, a customer relationship that to tell your friends about and ultimately a brand that stands out. And I appreciate your question because that has been three legs of the strategy for many, many years and I think the growing traction that we are having on a lot of fronts, including on the financial side is a product of that opportunity. And I think there is a lot more upside from here.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And your next question will come from Brian Hogan with William Blair.","Brian Hogan","Good afternoon. Thanks. First question is on the competition and your views on the Applecart and the potential pressure could come from that large competitor in there, growth has been pretty dramatic in the first year or so? And then a follow-up on that is actually potential competition from like the challenger banks like Chime and Varo, N26 and others. Are you seeing any customer losses from those?","Richard Fairbank","Right. So, Brian your question is about competition. Our focus is really more on the sort of the tech side and the new innovation as opposed to just the \u2013 let me start with just a comment about competition in general in the card business and then let me pivot to some specific things. The credit card business, I think has \u2013 I think back to the founding of Capital One is I would say that Capital One is a very young company to most \u2013 compared to most of our bank competitors. They have been around for over 100 years. In Capital One\u2019s case, it\u2019s not an accident that we started with credit cards, because we had a belief way back then that credit cards structurally had a number of advantages that would allow them to have very good earnings power and also be absolutely at the tip of the spear of where the whole tech revolution and information revolution were taking it. It is funny over 25 years into this journey I am finding a lot of the same observations that we had before. And I think the credit card as a business is kind of standing out in these times relative to the earnings power of the business like this as well as some of the growth opportunities that it has. That said that insight is not lost on our competitors and this is a very competitive business. But because of the scale of the requirements in the business, it is \u2013 it\u2019s a very consolidated business and I think most of the competition revolves around the top 10 players in the business. And I think the competition is intense, but I think it\u2019s fundamentally rational. But the intent shows up in marketing intensity, rewards, offers, pricing and various things, but if we pull way up and I cross-calibrate to other parts of banking in which we play, this feels like we have the area with the highest opportunity and the most kind of rationale marketplace at the moment.","Let me pivot to the tech marketplace. Often we are asked by investors about fin-techs and what about this startup and that startup and of course we keep an eye on that. I think the sort of elephant in the room is the gigantic tech companies and the sort of opportunities that they have. And so we have always had a lot of respect for that and frankly, our tech transformation is motivated in many ways by trying to emulate and learn from some of the best practices of those companies. It certainly has our attention. When Apple launches the Applecart, I think it was a really, really well done marketing campaign, which is universally what we have observed from Apple for many, many years. And we will keep an eye on that, but I would say that, that now adds to the list of impressive competitors and impressive offerings that we are up against. If we pivot to the challenger banks that are out there, so I am going to switch more to the deposit and banking side of the business, there are some really striking numbers that have been posted by companies that are trying to establish themselves in banking. We know from having spent a lot of years doing this and right now having a national banking strategy and you see us on television, it is a really hard thing to dislodge business from the established banks with great scale and local presence and so that all of us are working very hard on that. I have been struck by the numbers of account origination that are coming out of some of the challenger\u2019s banks. The biggest question I have and I don\u2019t know the answer is it\u2019s just the question I have is how much activity level and true sustaining traction do they have. I am not saying they don\u2019t. I think it\u2019s something that is an important place to look, but we are inspired by some of the innovation our competitors are doing and it\u2019s a reminder to all of us that if we really lean into a tech innovation, there is an opportunity to chip away at the extraordinary position that a few of the biggest banks in the U.S. have.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","Your final question on the evening will come from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.","Eric Wasserstrom","Perfect. Thank you for fitting me in. Rich, in your commentary, you alluded to the fact that competition in the auto space intensified to some extent, can you just give us a little more insight on what you are referring to in what ways that manifested? And then I have one quick unrelated follow-up.","Richard Fairbank","Yes. So, the auto business has a relatively small number of very large players and I have often said, Eric that competition in auto is even more impactful than in the short-term than competition in card only because on the auto side you have a dealer in the middle of an auction. And when the dealer sees something from a particular lender, like a loser credit policy or a different pricing, the dealer can drive a significant amount of business in a way that just doesn\u2019t happen in the one-to-one marketing that happens on the card side. So, it\u2019s why almost every conversation that we have about auto and every time we celebrate a particular growth that we have, we always caution how big that factor is and how much that factor can create adverse selection if people are loosening their credit policies. So what we do is we invest heavily in technology in this business and we are absolutely every quarter we are out there to get whatever opportunity we can have consistent with our own standards and with a very, very watchful eye on the competition. In the last \u2013 over the last few years, there was a pullback of a couple of competitors that we took advantage of. Both of them have certainly returned and are pretty aggressive players in the space. And what we would describe to you is that the competition is increasing in the auto space. It\u2019s nothing to wave red flags about, but it\u2019s generally increasing and it\u2019s a little bit unusual that at the same time we are saying competition is increasing that we are also saying our originations and even our book of business overall actually increasing. That is something that maybe a little bit anomalous. There is also something hard for us to tease out is the growing traction that we are getting by the very heavy investment we have in technology in the auto business that\u2019s in terms of underwriting real time big data driven underwriting the creation of products for customers and dealers in this space that are very sophisticated tech-driven products that actually have real-time mass scoring of any car anywhere across the nation and the continued success that we have had in building deep dealer relationships. So, it\u2019s a particularly kind of good quarter for Capital One, but I think the impression I would leave you is the competitive meter is rising and we will have to keep an eye on that. And the other very important thing that is probably the most important thing that we all should keep in mind in this business is that the auto business has been credit performance in the \u2013 I am speaking of the industry now has been benign for a long period of time. And at the top of the list is why that is so is what has happened, what is going on with used car prices, which have been stayed at a relatively high level for a long period of time. This is a collateral driven business. I also think when you have businesses where the collateral values have been high for a long period of time, one have to \u2013 we have to ask ourselves what collateral assumptions \u2013 collateral value assumptions are underwriters making across the industry. I will tell you what we do and we assume they are going down. I can\u2019t speak for the whole industry, but I just want to put a caution that we have had good times for a long time in that business and collateral values have been an unusually strong ally and one forever.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thank you for that. And my very quick follow-up, Scott, is just on the tax rate it looks like it came in around 19% or so in this quarter. How should \u2013 was there anything special in this period, some true-ups or something and how should we think about the appropriate rate going forward?","Scott Blackley","Yes. Let me comment on more of the full year tax rate, because that\u2019s what I would point you to the full year tax rate was about 19.5%. I would say that\u2019s a reasonable baseline. It\u2019s going to be plus or minus from there depending on the income levels evolutions in our credit, the businesses that generate tax credits, but nothing particularly large. We did have some discretes in the quarter which drove down the quarterly rate, but 19.5% is a good starting point for how you should think about the future.","Jeff Norris","Thanks, Scott and thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call today. Thank you for your interest in Capital One. Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer some follow-up questions that you might have. Have a great evening everybody.","Operator","Once again, that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norris","Thanks very much, Justin, and welcome, everybody, to Capital One's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. And to access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there.","In addition to the press release and financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our fourth quarter 2013 results. With me tonight are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Steve Crawford, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Steve will walk you through this presentation.","To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.

Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials.","Capital One does not take -- undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Steve?","Stephen S. Crawford","Thanks, Jeff, let me begin on Slide 3 this evening. Capital One earned $859 million or $1.45 per share in the fourth quarter. Like last quarter, we have included a reconciliation table in the appendix that shows non-GAAP deal-adjusted net income in the quarter of $1 billion or $1.75 per share.","Pre-provision earnings of $2.3 billion were down $240 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by seasonally higher marketing expenses and nonrecurring restructuring expenses. Additionally, linked-quarter revenues were lower, driven by the portfolio sale.","Provision expense increased on a linked-quarter basis, as we recognized seasonally higher charge-offs and a smaller allowance release. Consistent with the estimates we provided in January of this year, 2013 pre-provision earnings were approximately $10 billion, excluding nonrecurring items. Operating expenses for 2013 were also in line with our previous estimate, with actual operating expenses coming in a little higher than $11.1 billion.","Moving to Slide 4. Let me touch on net interest margin, which decreased 16 basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.73%, primarily driven by the impact of the sale of Best Buy. This was partially offset by higher yields on our investment portfolio.","Average interest-earning assets were down quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by the full-quarter impact of the Best Buy portfolio sale and expected runoff in mortgage loans, partially offset by growth in commercial and auto.","Total interest-bearing deposits were down quarter-over-quarter, driven by planned runoff in our legacy direct bank. We continue to expect portfolio runoff of about $1 billion in card and about $4 billion in mortgage in 2014.","Moving to Slide 5. Our Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel I basis declined about 50 basis points in the quarter to end at 12.2%, reflecting the completion of our previously announced share buyback program, as well as higher assets in the quarter. We estimate our pro forma fully phased in Basel III standardized Tier 1 common equity ratio to be 10.9% as of December 31. This will become our primary regulatory capital ratio beginning in the first quarter of 2014. While there's still work in progress industry-wide on the final implications for capital under the Basel III advanced approaches, we continue to estimate we are above our target of 8%.","Our own estimates of earnings and capital under severely adverse stress scenarios, bolstered by our actual performance in the Great Recession, suggest we have substantial flexibility to return capital to shareholders and remain well capitalized. However, we note that the Fed's modeling under CCAR will potentially result in material lower ratios under stress than our own internal modeling. For some time, we have highlighted for our investors that the Federal Reserve has increasingly done its own modeling in successive CCAR iterations and would take on balance sheet modeling in the 2014 CCAR.","On December 16, the Federal Reserve released additional information about how it will independently project banks' balance sheets and risk-weighted assets for the 2014 CCAR process. It appears that the Federal Reserve will assume loan growth of about 2% in loans under severely adverse stress, across the banking industry and across different types of loans. This is particularly noteworthy for credit card and consumer businesses as we would expect significant contraction in loans in our credit card and auto businesses in our stress scenario, consistent with the industry and our own experience in past recessions.","All that said, our view of our own capital strength and trajectory and our intent to distribute capital to shareholders have not changed. In our recent 2014 CCAR submission, we requested share repurchases that, if approved, would result in a total payout ratio well above the 2013 industry norm of 50%.","Let me close tonight with a brief comment on 2014 expectations. We expect 2014 GAAP pre-provision earnings, excluding nonrecurring items, of approximately $9.8 billion with a reasonable margin of error. We continue to expect 2014 operating expenses of approximately $10.5 billion, again, excluding nonrecurring items. And we expect marketing expenses to rise in 2014, although as always, actual marketing expenses will depend on our assessment of market and competitive opportunities.","After adjusting 2013 revenues for the loss of Best Buy, which contributed a little over $630 million in revenues, this year, we expect very modest revenue growth in 2014. There are other important factors, which drive the ultimate earnings to shareholders, Rich will spend more time on credit trends by line of business. In addition, rep and warranty and litigation continue to be a significant source of uncertainty for the industry and Capital One is no exception.","With that, let me turn the call over to Rich.","Richard D. Fairbank","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 7 with an overview of the Domestic Card business.","Ending loans grew seasonally and were up about 5% from the third quarter, despite the continuing planned runoff. Ending loans declined about 12% year-over-year. Excluding the Best Buy portfolio sale and the planned runoff, the year-over-year decline in ending loans was about 1%.","Purchase volume on general purpose credit cards, which excludes private-label cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 8% year-over-year. Looking below the surface, the trends in loans and purchase volumes continue to reflect our strategic choices, which focus on generating attractive, sustainable and resilient returns. We're avoiding high-balance revolvers and allowing the least resilient parts of the acquired HSBC portfolio to runoff.","In contrast, we're seeing strong underlying loan growth in many segments, including transactors and revolvers other than high-balance revolvers. New account originations are growing, and we're seeing more opportunities to increase lines for existing customers, which should improve the trajectory of both loan growth and purchase volume growth over time. As we said last quarter, we don't expect these improvements to result in overall Domestic Card loan growth until sometime around the second half of 2014. For the next couple quarters, we expect underlying loan growth will continue to be offset by shrinkage in the parts of the business we're avoiding.","Revenue margin for the quarter was 17.3%, down from the third quarter due to the absence of held-for-sale accounting impacts. Recall that the third quarter revenue margin, excluding held-for-sale accounting impacts, was 17.2%. The underlying revenue margin was relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis, as expected seasonal declines were offset by the favorable run rate margin impact from the sale of the Best Buy portfolio. The portfolio sale also drove the quarterly decline in revenue dollars.","Noninterest expense improved by $49 million in the quarter, driven by the absence of the third quarter legal reserve addition, partially offset by an increase in marketing expense. On a linked-quarter basis, the charge-off rate increased seasonally by about 22 basis points to 3.89%. Delinquency rate decreased about 3 basis points to 3.43%. Fourth quarter charge-offs and delinquencies were impacted by the temporary increase we discussed last quarter.","Recall that in July, we changed a number of customer practices on the HSBC branded card portfolio to align them with Capital One policies and practices. These changes temporarily increased Domestic Card delinquency rate by about 20 basis points in the fourth quarter and temporarily increased the monthly domestic charge-off rate by about 35 basis points in December.","We expect the monthly charge-off rate to remain temporarily elevated by about 35 basis points through March, in addition to normal seasonality. We expect the impact will diminish in April and we'll be mostly out of the charge-off rate by the end of the second quarter. To be clear, these estimated impacts are only one of the many factors that will drive charge-offs and are not meant as forecasts for specific quarterly or monthly metrics.","Looking beyond the short-term trend, we expect that our focus on resilience and our strong credit risk underwriting will continue to drive relatively stable credit results at historically strong levels with normal seasonal patterns.","Our card business remains well positioned. We're delivering strong, sustainable and resilient returns, and we're generating capital on a strong trajectory, which strengthens our balance sheet and enables capital distribution.","Moving to Slide 8. The Consumer Banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans declined about $500 million from the third quarter. Continuing growth in auto loans was more than offset by expected mortgage runoff. Auto originations declined modestly in the fourth quarter, in line with seasonal trends we've observed in the past.","For the full year 2013, subprime originations were relatively stable, while prime originations grew as we captured additional prime share from our existing dealers. More prime originations add to the pressure on margins and partially offset the expected increase in delinquency and charge-off rates.","Ending deposit balances declined by about $800 million in the quarter. We have ample deposit funding in a period of relatively low overall loan growth, so we've throttled back on growth, mostly in legacy Capital One direct deposit businesses.","Consumer Banking revenue was relatively stable compared to the third quarter. The revenue impact of declining Consumer Banking loan balances and margin compression in Auto Finance was partially offset by an increase in Home Loan yields resulting from higher estimated cash flows that we expect to collect on acquired Home Loans portfolios.","Noninterest expense increased $91 million in the quarter, driven by higher marketing in our Retail deposits business and a number of individually small operating expense items, many of which are nonrecurring. Provision expense was stable in the quarter.","Auto charge-off rate and delinquencies increased in line with expected seasonal patterns and the continuing cyclical trend we've discussed for several quarters. As we've said before, we are now past the cyclical low point for auto charge-off and delinquency rates. The industry continues to normalize to more business-as-usual underwriting, following significant tightening during the Great Recession. And we expect some softening in historically high used car auction values. As a result, we expect Auto Finance credit losses will continue to gradually increase from the historic lows of the past few years, but will remain comfortably within ranges that support an attractive and resilient business.","Home Loans credit trends remain favorable and continue to perform well inside of the assumptions we made when we acquired the mortgage portfolios. The overall Consumer Banking charge-off rate remains strong at about 1%.","As we enter 2014, we expect that Auto Finance revenues, margins and returns will continue to decline as we move from exceptional levels to more cycle-average performance. We expect that Auto Finance returns will remain resilient and well above hurdle rate. Additionally, we expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low rate environment will continue to pressure the economics of our Retail deposit businesses, even if rates begin to rise in 2014.","As you can see on Slide 9, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of solid growth and profitability. Loans grew 6% in the quarter and 16% year-over-year, driven by growth in specialized industry verticals in C&I lending and CRE. Revenues were up about 12% from the third quarter and about 18% compared to the fourth quarter of last year.","The year-over-year increase was mostly the result of growth in loan and deposit balances and spreads. The quarterly increase was driven by ongoing balance growth and the addition of Beech Street Capital on November 1, which increased revenues and noninterest expense in the quarter.","Commercial credit continued to improve. While the currency -- excuse me, while the current very low charge-off levels are not necessarily sustainable, we continue to see low levels of nonperforming and criticized loan balances, so we expect the credit performance of our Commercial Banking business to remain very strong.","While increasing competition, particularly in middle-market lending, may continue to impact the pricing and volume of new loan originations, we expect our focused and specialized approach to Commercial Banking to deliver strong results. Across our Commercial Banking businesses, loan growth, credit and profitability trends remain healthy.","I'll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 10. Capital One delivered strong results in 2013. We successfully completed the integrations and brand conversions of 2 transformational acquisitions. We made significant progress on operational and infrastructure improvements, including our digital agenda. We expect these improvements will help us stay ahead of rising regulatory demands and achieve cost savings, and to enhance our customer experience and build and sustain the value of our long term customer franchise.","We added great talent at every level of the organization, including the Board of Directors and our senior leadership team. We delivered strong financial performance from the company and across our businesses. And we continue to generate capital, increase our dividend and completed a $1 billion share repurchase program.","Of course, many of the significant challenges we faced in 2013 will continue in 2014. We still face a difficult growth environment, significant planned runoff, and the revenue impact of selling the Best Buy portfolio.","Interest rates remain persistently low, creating ongoing economic pressure, even if rates begin to rise in 2014. And we'll need to stay ahead of regulatory demands, from ongoing Dodd-Frank rulemaking, U.S. regulators implementation of Basel capital and liquidity requirements and the evolving CCAR process.","Despite these continuing challenges, Capital One is earning very attractive risk-adjusted returns today, and we expect that will continue in 2014. But we're always focused on the important levers that will sustain and further improve our profitability. We are committed to tightly managing costs across our businesses. We don't view this as a one-off project. It's a major multiyear agenda. And it's a focus in all of our businesses and in every budget cycle.","Our credit results are strong, driven by our long-standing discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our continuing focus on resilience. Growth remains a high priority for us, but is always in the context of a preemptive focus on generating attractive, sustainable and resilient returns. We expect planned runoff will drive declining home loan balances.","On the other hand, we expect growth in areas we're emphasizing, including Commercial Banking and Auto Finance, will continue. And we expect year-over-year growth in Domestic Card loans to resume in the second half of 2014.","Finally, capital management remains an important part of how we expect to deliver superior and sustainable returns to our investors. And Steve affirmed our capital return intentions for 2014. Our capital and liquidity positions remain strong. Our businesses continue to deliver attractive and sustainable returns and generate capital on a strong trajectory. We're comfortable with our strategic footprint, and planned runoff frees up capital. All of these factors support our planned capital distributions in 2014.","Now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Justin, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","A couple questions I'll ask upfront. I was just wondering if you could talk about the marketing budget and kind of where the opportunities are to take that up in 2014. And then just conversely, to the extent that you are going tweak it one way or the other, what factors would determine that? Would it be credit-related? And I guess secondly, on capital, if the Fed were to disagree with your version of the test, do you envision having the opportunity to resubmit?","Richard D. Fairbank","Sanjay, let me start with your first question. I'll let Steve take the second one. So the marketing budget for 2014, which is, as we mentioned, is up from the 2013 budget, I think, is a reflection of increased opportunity that we see. And of course, the biggest part of the marketing budget is relative to our card business. I think these opportunities are across the areas that we are investing in, Sanjay. So continued investment in the heavy spender and transactor space, where we feel we're getting very good traction; a continued and increasing investment in the medium- and low-balance revolver part of the business, where we feel we're getting increasing traction as well.","So that's -- and what factors will affect that? And you asked, is credit a leading one? Well, big changes in credit obviously can cause significant impacts on that. All you have to do is look at the last Great Recession. But the biggest things are really dialing up and down based on traction we're getting, response from our test cells, how rollouts are going and what do we want to accelerate or slow it down. So it's really mostly response-driven line of scrimmage calls that -- with which we tweak that.","Stephen S. Crawford","Then I'd answer on having an opportunity to have a second bite. We believe we would. We passed qualitatively in 2013. The Fed's expectations for people's filings, clearly the standards for that have gone up over the year. We think we've made a substantial investment to continue to improve our processes. So we have every reason to expect that we would have another opportunity.","Operator","The next question comes from Brad Ball with Evercore.","Bradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Actually, I have a question for Steve and for Rich. So Steve, the $9.8 billion pre-pre that you guided to, you talked about $630 million of BBY revenues lost, and it's the same, I guess, roughly $600 million of expense savings. What is the main difference going from $10 billion in '13 down to $9.8 billion in '14?","And then for Rich, in terms of the outlook for potential card growth in the second half of this year, what areas do you see that growth likely coming in? Are you still focused on prime, the high end of prime, or might you go to the lower end of prime? And what are the implications for the card revenue margin? Are you thinking that card revenue margin will hold in here around the 17% range?","Stephen S. Crawford","Yes. At least with respect to forecasts, I think we've kind of gone out as far as we're prepared to go in terms of precision. We gave forecasts in 2013 and kudos to the team for how close we actually came to those forecasts from 12 months ago. And there's obviously a lot of puts and takes, but we wanted to center around the pre-provision. As you've mentioned and like last year, there was some tradeoffs. There could be in the coming year as well. So I think, we've probably been near -- as definitive as we want to be with respect to line items.","Richard D. Fairbank","Brad, the card growth is -- we're getting traction pretty much in all the areas we're investing. And so -- and again, the heavy spender\/transactor space and the revolver space, excluding the kind of high balance revolver, we are -- it's pretty much across the ranges there where we are continuing to get traction. So I think the nature of our growth will be kind of similar to the kind of mix of growth that we sort of generally have gotten at Capital One. And so I don't think that will be an outsized impact on the revenue margin from the increased traction that we're seeing on the card side.","Operator","The next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Rich and Steve, just following up on the PPNR guidance, I guess. You've told us the implications on revenue. You've given us a good sense on cost. And I look on Slide 10, it says one of the things that you're focused on is improving profitability. So I guess the 2 pieces there are, we could have growth, which clearly you've pointed to in the back half of the year, but credit could also get better.","And I guess outside of the 35-basis-point increase, do you think we could see credit continue to get better from the current levels? And my follow question is, just in terms of the capital, with the Fed modeling your balance sheet, you said they're going to assume 2% growth. How much capital volatility relative to your past expectations would that create for you?","Richard D. Fairbank","Okay. So on the -- with your question with respect to credit, could credit get better from here? We are at -- we keep saying that we're at cycle lows. And it's quite extraordinary on the consumer side of the business and certainly let's really focus on credit cards here where, I think, probably your question was particularly directed. This is, it's just when you really look at why credit is so good, it's just sort of hard to imagine it getting too much better from here.","But on the other hand, I think in many ways, if you strip away the sort of -- if you adjust for seasonality effects and HSBC, temporary effects, there was a slight, slightly better than sort of seasonal effect we saw in the fourth quarter on the delinquency side. I really wouldn't read too much into that. I think what I would take away from all that we observed is that the prospect for really good credit looks very good. I wouldn't really trumpet the upside benefits from here, but what I really like is how solid the prospects are for very strong credit at the kind of best part of the credit cycle here.","Stephen S. Crawford","So I don't want to pick out individual pieces of what the Fed is doing and try and isolate what that impact alone could be because, as we've talked with you over time, they're estimating PPNR. They're estimating losses. They're estimating balance sheet. To try and help you out a little bit more though, in the release that they had, they talked about average loan growth that they saw under stress of 1% to 2%. In contrast, if you look at the average bank in the 2013 CCAR, I think the loan decline that they modeled was around 8%. And as you know, we're not the average bank, given our higher concentration in consumer. So you would see naturally more attrition in our loans.","Operator","And that will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a question about your commercial loan yields. Unlike the rest of the portfolio, and I appreciate that there are one-time items in that, the yield on the commercial portfolio continues to rise. Can you give us a little color as to what's driving that and where you -- what your expectations might be for 2014 yield in the Commercial Banking portfolio?","Richard D. Fairbank","So Matt, quarterly loan yields, as you note, they are up 5 basis points. And it's driven by seasonally high originations of equipment leases that earn higher tax-equivalent yields. So there's depreciation benefits of certain leases. They're recognized as an increase in yield. There was a similar seasonal increase in yields in the fourth quarter of 2012. This increase is temporary because tax-equivalent yields normalize after the fourth quarter.","Looking at the longer-term trends rather than the temporary fourth quarter increase is a better indicator of the trend in loan yields. And year-over-year, loan yields decreased by 23 basis points. And that's driven by a few factors. Obviously, there's -- competition out there is pretty heavy in certain parts of the marketplace. A little less so in the specialty areas, where we have most of our growth. But still, there is increasing competition.","Also, we are shifting our portfolio toward floating-rate loans on an increasing sort of trend there. And then, finally, we're focusing our new originations on loans with higher credit quality. Within the commercial real estate space, there's been -- even if we look at some of the projected losses of the new originations, they are even lower than recent originations. And so there's a bit of a credit offset relative to the tighter yields there. So that's pretty much the picture on loan yields.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask, you've mentioned runoff a couple of times, have you updated your estimates for what the mortgage portfolio and card portfolio runoff will be in 2014?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes. $4 billion in mortgage, $1 billion in card.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then presumably that's done by -- the card is done by '15?","Richard D. Fairbank","Well, it's a declining number. At some point, we'll kind of stop talking about it.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I was wondering if I could ask about the capital ratios you give up. And specifically, as we look out over the next couple of years, stress test this year, clearly your guiding to the standardized ratio being the key one. Is it still the key one next year? At what point would you kind of expect to flip to the advanced ratio? And also within that, is it given that the advanced ratio versus standardized ratio gap always stays this big or over time, can that roughly 300-basis-point difference kind of shrink?","Stephen S. Crawford","So I think we'll be primarily under standardized at least through until 2016. We are relatively early in the parallel run process. And yes, as you've seen, I think, with a lot of peers who are in parallel run and maybe someone will emerge at some point in time, there's an opportunity to incorporate that into the way that the business actually operates. So I think -- while I wouldn't count on it, convergence is a definite possibility.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Arnold with RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could update us on the competitive environment, perhaps both in auto and card, please?","Richard D. Fairbank","Okay. Sure, Jason. So in the card business, competition is -- it's really pretty stable. You've seen industry, just in terms of their balances and originations, you've seen them down significantly from the peak, slightly ahead of 2012. But in general, in the last few quarters, we've seen industry balances kind of with 0% year-over-year growth. So things aren't going anywhere fast overall in that space.","The direct mail volumes for 2013 were higher than 2012, but only modestly and far from the prerecession highs. But the significant decline we've seen in direct mail volumes has been partially offset competitively by a sizable increase in digital marketing volume. So unfortunately as we all use that index of direct mail volumes, let's just realize that it probably understates -- the trends understate competitive effects because of the digital trends.","But all of that said, still we see stability on the pricing side and in really most aspects of the competitive environment. Long-term pricing is rational in the segments that we compete in. And the high-balance revolver space, where we see very long teasers, and we don't believe that the pricing there is, to our own projections, resilient enough. But in the rest of the business, I think it's competitive, but pretty stable. And the reward space is intensely competitive, as we know. But I think it's kind of stable within the context of being intensely competitive. But overall, pulling way up in card.","I think it's a fairly rational market that offers the opportunity for us to generate exceptional returns and growth and to grow in the segments where we are choosing to compete. So we feel good about that. And frankly, when I cross calibrate to some of the intensity that you see across all of banking, I think general -- regular old sort of vanilla C&I lending, I think is certainly -- that a lot of banks are just rushing into that. You have quite a run into the auto business as well.","I think the card business stands out as a -- in a stable place and one that the survivors in that business can, I think, do well on a stable basis. In the auto business, we had this phenomenon, Jason, of a kind of once-in-a-lifetime set of conditions that existed competitively in the auto business, where a lot of competitors ran for the hills. The consumer -- as the consumer became extremely cautious, the consumer continued to -- you had the consumer being very cautious, but continuing to, of all things, be sure to pay on their auto loans kind of thing.","And then finally, you had the -- on the manufacturing side, we had so much reduction in supply. So what's happened competitively in the auto business is just a regression back toward the mean from a once-in-a-lifetime kind of situation. The thing to most -- to keep a look at competitively is really what's happening in underwriting and in pricing. So if I divide between the prime and subprime business in margins. On the prime side, they are -- they're challenged at this point. I'd say, a little bit below cycle average at this point. And that frankly, they're at prerecession levels.","In subprime, they're healthy, but slowly falling toward the mean. LTVs that we really have to keep an eye on are stable and healthy in prime. And they're starting to increase moderately in subprime, that's a slight change from last time. We talked about this, but well below peak levels still at this point.","FICO scores in both segments are stable. And the terms of loans, there's been some sizable growth of beyond 72-month loans in both prime and even subprime. Overall, prime is -- has intense competition and is overall competitively a little bit below the kind of equilibrium in the cycle. And in the subprime, it is above and a better place than equilibrium, but moving toward that equilibrium.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets.","Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just with regard to costs overall, the banking industry is facing revenue challenges and looking to cut costs to kind of offset that. I'm just wondering, I know you have the built-in merger-related cost that go away in '14, but just wondering what other cost-cutting opportunities you see out there?","Richard D. Fairbank","Okay. The -- I think the biggest areas for cost management are in digital and in third-party management. Digital is one we're going to be talking about for years and years and years. And the opportunity is -- but it's a subtle and complex one.","And by the way, all the work we do in digital isn't first and foremost motivated by cost savings. I think it's a bit of a fool's errand and really off the bull's eye to chase digital for the sake of cost reduction. But it is a byproduct of a transformation of a company and very significant things can come from that.","So with respect to digital, how do we generate cost savings? What we need to do is build the capability to offer a great customer experience to our customers. And there's a lot of work for all banks to do that. And we're making a lot of progress in that. When one does that, it's only the beginning of the journey because when you build it, they won't necessarily come. So there's a huge effort to drive customers to digital as well.","And we have very comprehensive kind of campaigns with respect to that and building deeper digital relationships with the customers as we do this. Then additionally, we need to make digital how we do business not only with our customers, but also how we operate the company. So the back-office basically, the way we do business, and most importantly at all -- of all, is who we are and how we think about the business. And in the same way, I really want to point out, in the same way that we built an information-based company over these past 20 years, this is a lot different from just getting some smart analysts and some databases and appending it on the side of the company. Really becoming an information company becomes, in the end, really making that who you are.","We have set our beacon with respect to digital that aggressively to say in a sense that is our destination of who we are, the type of talent we have and so on. So there's a lot of years in that, but I think there's a lot of economics as a byproduct of that, that come. The other area I really want to kind of highlight is third-party management. Well over half of our operating costs at Capital One are actually cost -- things that we pay to third-party vendors.","And there's a lot of work going on comprehensively to -- with respect to the talent side and the governance side and the negotiating side and the whole way that we -- and even in-sourcing a bunch of this stuff to drive better quality and frankly, significant savings out of that. None of this will transform any year's kind of metrics. But our year-after-year emphasis on cost is one that goes far beyond we'll just try to see what we can cut today. This is really comprehensively trying to redesign how we run the business.","Operator","And the next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So could you give us some idea as to what we could look at from an external standpoint to judge kind of the effectiveness of the marketing? I mean, we sort of don't know that much about accounts. Could you just talk about what we should be looking for?","Richard D. Fairbank","Well, Moshe, I think that -- let me, first of all, talk about how we look at it, because I can appreciate that there is no one single metric that you can look at that has a direct link. There are a number of ones that are very important over time. The most important thing to us is the creation of value. So what we do is, as you know, Moshe, everything that we do before, during and after we do it, we measure the net present value of every initiative to generate more business, either be it something with existing accounts or the origination of new accounts.","And when we look at our net present value per -- not kind of -- total projected net present value created in a year of originations, what we're projecting, sort of, these days is as high as I've seen in total over versus -- you'd have to go back a long time to see numbers quite as high as this. Now I mean, they're not going to massively show up in metrics tomorrow. A lot of what we're originating is, frankly, more things that are -- that build value in the long term, that have lower attrition, low credit losses and build balances over time.","But where you see in the metrics, though, now back to more of the metrics that you see, Moshe, on the purchase volume side, you can see quite a bit of traction there. We try to give you the branded card purchase volume so that it doesn't -- so it can be separated from the private-label side of things. If you look beyond that and actually look at the heavy spender part of our portfolio, we're getting more traction than manifested just on that particular metric.","You've also seen that despite the significant runoff portfolio. We're talking now about outstandings growth year-over-year, quarterly outstandings growth returning in -- somewhere in the second half of next year. So we're starting to pick up more traction on the outstandings. But again, relative to some other competitors and relative to some of the older days in Capital One, most of what we're booking is not stuff that is heavily balance intensive. It's really stuff that is more long-term value and a slower balance build over time. But hopefully, that's a bit helpful. But that's how we view it.","Operator","And the next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","My -- I have a question then just to follow up on -- my question is, with respect to your representation and warranty reserve, you have one of the lower reserves relative to outstanding UPBs. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that in light of some of the settlements we've seen, and if there's been any increase in your possible loss above current reserves expectation? And then I have a follow-up on the Basel III issue.","Stephen S. Crawford","Yes, I don't do that you can look at UPB as an indicator of -- and do that as a ratio. I don't think anybody has done that, of what your potential exposure is. There's so many categorizations under that, that are important. And I think we've done actually a really nice job in our disclosure, which I always point to when anybody want to talk about rep and warranty, kind of taking you through all of the factors which drive kind of where we are and what our reserves are and what the principal factors are, which could amount to changes going forward.","And so I don't think just a simple calculation of UPB to exposures is really the way to look at it. This continues to be a source of uncertainty for us and other companies on the mortgage front. And we've tried to keep that front and center. There weren't a lot of changes quarter-over-quarter for us in our numbers. And obviously, a big part of what we try and do in thinking about rep and warranty is making sure we incorporate other things that we see in the marketplace to make sure that, that drives the assumptions we are making with respect to our exposure going forward.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then just to follow up on the Basel III issue. What accounts for such a significant difference in the RWAs between the standardized and advanced approach? Because it seems like the biggest differential for a lot of institutions is the risk weighting on commercial loans. But that's such a small part of your loan balances broadly, so what's accounting for the difference?","Stephen S. Crawford","I think that securitized assets are the biggest difference in terms of RWA. You have a different treatment under Basel standardized. It's fairly punitive for the industry relative to the plain Basel I calculation.","Operator","Our final question comes from Daniel Furtado with Jefferies & Company.","Daniel Furtado - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I have 2. I guess you would call them follow-up questions. The first is, earlier you said that you expected card growth would come from where it has always come from. But over the last couple of years, we've noticed that you, like many in the industry, have gone substantially upmarket in terms of FICO exposure. So when you say, \"Comes from where it always has,\" should we think over the last couple of years or roll back even further than that?","Richard D. Fairbank","Daniel, our profile of originations has -- the span of FICOs has stayed pretty consistent over the years. We haven't denominated our conversation so much by FICO score as much by the nature of how much the customer is borrowing and some of things we talk about with respect to high-balance revolvers.","So while yes, we have seen a big effort to penetrate at the top end of the market by Capital One with some of the things you've even seen on TV, our Quicksilver card and our Venture card and so on, we continue very consistently to market across the FICO ranges that we have over the past. And I think there's a little tightening that we've done over the years. But our strategy has stayed pretty consistent. What we were doing prerecession is pretty consistent to what we're doing now.","Daniel Furtado - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","The follow-up would be, you had mentioned that you feel like we're past the cyclical low point for auto credit. I understand that we may or may not necessarily be at the cyclical low for credit -- for credit cards. And is the simple reason because of the equilibrium that you talked about earlier getting a little bit, I won't say, overheated but slightly out of balance in the auto space? Or how should we think about the, in essence, mismatch in the cycle low point for auto and card?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes. Thank you, Daniel. I -- sometimes I think that auto may just be the first mover. I think auto was the first mover before the Great Recession and maybe it's a first mover on the other side of this. I don't know. That may be coincidental. I think the conditions in auto were that -- what happened during the auto -- during the Great Recession in the competitive environment and the underwriting environment was a little bit more extreme in auto.","So -- and as a result, the auto performance in the wake of the Great Recession was unusually strong, which caused a lot of players to rush in and a lot of players to start changing some of their underwriting standards along the way. And so that's led to more -- a more dramatic reduction in losses and probably an earlier turnaround. I would describe what happened in the card business is that while everyone tightened up in the card business, there's been a consistency and a rationality in this marketplace.","I think, overall, every company has kind of gone back, looked through the debris of the Great Recession and kind of picked their spots. But it's been pretty stable, pretty rational. And the bigger issue there has been sort of waiting for more demand to kind of pick up. But -- and the lack of demand in that marketplace was -- the flip side of that is just the conservative consumer. And I think the conservative consumer, conservative banks and a stable environment have just led to exceptional credit that persists to this day and is likely to persist in card for some time.","Jeff Norris","Well, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the conference call today and thanks for your continuing interest in Capital One.

","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Perlin. Gary?","Gary L. Perlin","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon to everyone listening to the call. Let me provide a few highlights from the quarter and full year on Slide 3. Capital One earned $407 million or $0.88 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011. We saw strength in loan growth and stable revenue. Earnings declined, however, due to increases in non-interest and provision expense, the latter reflecting stabilizing credit trends. There were an unusual number of unique items impacting revenue and operating expense, which I'll review in a moment. ","While full year 2011 results also had some noise, they provide a somewhat clearer picture of where we stand as we approach the integration of ING Direct and U.S. Credit Card business of HSBC in the first part of 2012. ","After falling in 2010, Capital One loan balances grew by some-8% over the course of 2011, resulting in a constant level of average loans.","Interest expense fell by about 30 basis points and margins remained stable. As credit improved, a substantial reduction in provision expense more than offset a significantly increased level of investment in marketing and operations to restart our loan growth engine. ","We also accelerated our buildout of top bank infrastructure especially in the second half of 2011 to ensure our readiness to execute on very attractive acquisition opportunities. ","Although we expect considerable noise in our 2012 financials from the purchase accounting effects, integration expenses and partial year impacts of these acquisitions, the economics of the deals are compelling and we remain excited about the sustained value creation they will enable. When the deals close, I will be able to provide you with a detailed view of how they are likely to affect our financials this year and beyond.","Now let's turn to Slide 4, and I'll focus on the fourth quarter. Capital One earnings per share were $0.88 or $407 million in the fourth quarter compared to $1.77 or $813 million in the third quarter of 2011. The decline in linked quarter earnings was driven by lower pre-provision earnings and increasing provision expense.","Revenue in the quarter was down about $100 million or 2%, owing to a few unique items. Linked quarter revenue was negatively impacted as we recorded a very modest increase in our finance charge and fee reserve after an unusually large $83 million release in the FCFR in Q3 of 2011.","Q4 revenue was also hit by a further build in reserves to cover higher expected expenses related to past sales of payment protection insurance, or PPI, in our U.K. business. This resulted in a contra-revenue of approximately $81 million. ","In addition, non-interest income in Q4 was negatively impacted by a representation of warranty expense of $38 million. ","Stripping out these impacts, revenue increased over the third quarter by about 2.5%, in line with average loan growth.","Moving to non-interest expenses. They were up quarter-over-quarter due to a seasonal ramp in marketing spend and an increase in operating expenses. The $213 million increase in operating expense recorded in Q4 included $92 million in litigation expenses, 2\/3 of which relates to our U.S. Card business. We also had approximately $40 million in asset write-downs and other costs as we rationalize some facilities and equipment, principally related to acquired banking businesses. ","The remaining increase in operating expense reflects, in large part, continued investment in growing our businesses and the acceleration in building our top bank infrastructure as we prepare to integrate ING Direct and the U.S. Credit Card business of HSBC.","In view of our considerable progress on both these fronts, we expect our run rate operating expenses to remain at a level similar to the run rate of Q4. ","Provision expense increased in the quarter. While our outlook for credit performance improved modestly, the growth in loan balances and seasonal effects led to both a lower allowance release than in Q3 and a tick-up in charge-off dollars.","Turning to Slide 5. Let's take a quick look at balances and margin highlights. End-of-period loan balances grew in the quarter by almost $6 billion or 5%, reflecting growth in our Domestic Card, Commercial Lending and Auto Finance businesses. Average loans were up by $2.5 billion, as much of that quarterly balance growth was concentrated in the last few weeks of the year.","Net interest margin declined 17 basis points in the quarter to 7.22%. Benefiting the NIM was a shift from cash to loans and a reduction in funding costs attributable to lower deposit rates. However, these benefits were more than offset by a decline in loan yields, driven largely by onetime effects, such as the absence of a large finance charge and fee reserve release, which benefited Q3 interest income.","Turning to Slide 6. Let's take a closer look at year-over-year performance. Strong and stable margin performance and a significant credit improvement led to a 7% increase in net income from continuing operations between 2010 and 2011. On a total company basis, earnings rose by 15%. ","Pre-provision earnings decreased in 2011 as non-interest expenses grew. Emerging from the recession, we invested in additional marketing in the rollout of new product offerings across our businesses. We also made significant progress in the buildout of our top bank infrastructure. ","A substantial improvement in credit led to a 40% decline in provision expense in 2011. Charge-offs fell dramatically, the effect of which was somewhat offset by the lower level of allowance release as we see credits stabilize at historically strong levels.","And we returned to loan growth in 2011 with an 8% increase in end-of-period loans. As expected, the majority of that loan growth came in the back half of 2011, which resulted in average loans being largely flat year-over-year.","Moving to Slide 7. The strong loan growth at the end of the fourth quarter also had an impact on risk-weighted assets and related capital ratios. ","Despite an increase of $500 million in Tier 1 common equity, our Tier 1 common ratio decreased 30 basis points in the quarter to 9.7%, using Basel I definitions. Using known Basel III definitions, our Tier 1 common ratio would be approximately 10 basis points higher than that.","Over the course of 2011, we generated substantial amounts of capital by retaining $3.2 billion of earnings and recapturing $700 million of deferred tax assets previously disallowed in the calculation of regulatory capital. Our Tier 1 common ratio rose 90 basis points in 2011 despite a 22% increase in risk-weighted assets.","We continue to be comfortable with our strong capital levels and our capacity to generate healthy amounts of capital going forward. In the near term, closing the ING Direct acquisition and related capital transactions will cause our Tier 1 common ratio to rise. We still expect that our Tier 1 common ratio will be in the mid-9% range in the quarter we close on HSBC and complete the necessary capital actions.","With that, I will hand the call over to Rich. Rich?","Richard D. Fairbank","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 8 with a look at loan volumes. Domestic Card loan balances grew just under $3 billion or 5% in the quarter and for the full year. Fourth quarter growth was driven by seasonal spending and balance building on our growing account base. ","Growth for the year resulted largely from the addition of the Kohl's private label partnership, as well as a return to modest growth with normal seasonal patterns in our general purpose card business in the second half of the year. ","The expected runoff of Installment Loans was a drag on Domestic Card loan growth of about $400 million per quarter in 2011. Excluding the Installment Loan runoff, our Domestic Credit Card loans grew by a more robust $4.7 billion or about 9% for the full year.","Beyond loan growth, there are continuing signs of traction in our Domestic Card business. New accounts booked in the fourth quarter of 2011 were more than double the new accounts booked in the fourth quarter of 2010, and growth in our purchase volume outpaced the industry in 2011.","Fourth quarter 2011 purchase volume grew 15% from the fourth quarter of 2010 excluding purchase volumes in the Kohl's portfolio. ","Fourth quarter Domestic Card revenue grew 5% from the fourth quarter of 2010, driven by seasonal growth in loans, strong purchase volumes and stable margins. The Domestic Card business posted $2.3 billion in net income in 2011, driven by significant credit improvement, the return to modest loan growth and stable margins.","In addition to the continuing traction in our current Card business, we expect to close the acquisition of the HSBC U.S. Card business in the second quarter. We expect to acquire HSBC's portfolio, resilient card loans with strong returns, and the acquisition will also greatly enhance our partnership's business and capabilities. After the initial increase in loan volumes, the acquisition may mute our Domestic Card growth trajectory somewhat because of the expected runoff of portions of the HSBC portfolio. ","In Consumer Banking, loan balances were up modestly, as strong growth in Auto loans was partially offset by expected runoff of the Mortgage portfolio. Auto Finance originations were $3.6 billion, up 5% from the third quarter and 62% from the fourth quarter of 2010. Auto Loan balances at the end of 2011 were $22 billion, up 22% from the prior year. We expect that Auto originations will remain strong and drive continuing growth in Auto loans. ","We continue to gain traction in consumer deposits as well. Deposits grew 7% from the prior year while interest expense improved by 29 basis points. Deposit growth in the fourth quarter was essentially flat.","The Consumer Banking business delivered $810 million in net income in 2011, driven by the strong performance of the Auto Finance business and growth in deposits with improving interest expense rates. ","We expect to complete the ING Direct acquisition in the first quarter. This acquisition will have a significant impact on Consumer Banking loan and deposit growth trajectories. We expect that sizable runoff of the ING Mortgage portfolio and the continuing runoff of our legacy Mortgage portfolio will more than offset the growth in Auto loans, driving a declining trend in Consumer Banking loan volumes. Mortgage portfolio runoff is expected to mute total company loan growth rates as well.","With the acquisition expected to add $80 billion in deposits with attractive all-in costs, our Consumer Deposit businesses are shifting their emphasis toward solidifying franchise-building customer relationships and realizing the financial benefits of the ING Direct acquisition. The deposit volume trends in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflect this evolution in our deposit strategy in anticipation of the ING Direct acquisition.","Our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of steady loan growth. Ending loans were up 5% from the prior quarter and up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2010. Growth in loan commitments, an early indicator of future loan growth, was even stronger. We're targeting in achieving the strongest growth in those areas in which we built specialized expertise and capabilities, including rent control, multifamily real estate in Metro New York City and selected middle-market industry segments, such as energy and commercial finance.","Commercial deposits grew 5% in the quarter and 17% year-over-year with modest improvements in interest expense. The combination of improving credit and growth in loan and deposit volumes drove 2011 net income of $533 million in our Commercial Banking business.","The growth we're delivering today continues to focus on franchise-building customer relationships and accounts all over Capital One. These include rewards customers and new partnerships in our Domestic Card business, Commercial Banking customers and deposit customers and Auto dealer relationships in our Consumer Banking business. ","While loan balances and revenues from these customers ramp up gradually over time, we expect the growth of these franchise-building customer relationships to drive strong and sustain bottom line earnings and capital generation through sustainably lower charge-off levels, low attrition and long annuity-like revenue streams that build gradually but stick around for years. ","Slide 9 shows the credit results across our Consumer businesses are stabilizing at relatively strong levels and exhibiting expected seasonal patterns. ","Domestic Card charge-off rate increased 15 basis points in the quarter, consistent with expected seasonal patterns. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, charge-off rate improved by over 300 basis points, resulting from the significant cyclical credit improvements we experienced in 2011. ","The delinquency rate as of December 31 was essentially flat from the prior quarter at 3.66%. The delinquency rate improved 43 basis points from the end of 2010. We expect the Domestic Card credit metrics will continue to follow normal seasonal patterns in 2012.","In our Consumer Banking business, the charge-off rate in the Home Loans portfolio increased 37 basis points in the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we moved a portion of our mortgage loans from third-party servicers onto our own platforms. The quarterly increase in charge-off rate resulted from updated property values on these loans. This is a onetime impact that is not expected to impact charge-off rates going forward. ","Compared to the prior year quarter, the Home Loans charge-off rate was flat. Home Loan delinquency rate increased modestly in the quarter and year-over-year but remains very low at just under 1%. ","For the approximately $5 billion of Home Loans that were marked at acquisition, actual credit performance since the acquisition has been better than the assumptions in the original credit marks, keeping our reported credit metrics very low. ","In the Auto Finance business, charge-off rate and delinquency rate increased in the quarter, consistent with expected seasonal patterns. ","As you can see in the year-over-year improvements in both charge-offs and delinquencies, Auto Finance credit performance remains strong with the most recent originations continuing to perform better than originations from 2007 and 2008. ","Strong credit performance continues to reflect the actions we took to retrench and reposition the business, tighten underwriting and loss mitigation actions through the recession and continued strength in used car auction prices. ","We believe we reached the cyclical low point for Auto Finance charge-offs, and seasonal patterns will drive quarterly credit trends in 2012.","The choices we made in underwriting and managing our businesses through the Great Recession continue to drive strong credit performance. We made tough choices to tighten underwriting, focus only on the most resilient businesses and aggressively manage and mitigate credit losses. As a result, our internal portfolio of credit metrics remain strong with normal seasonality re-emerging after a long period of cyclical improvement.","Slide 10 shows credit results for our Commercial Banking business. The nonperforming asset rate for the Commercial Banking segment improved in the quarter despite an uptick in the NPA rate in our runoff Small-Ticket CRE portfolio. ","The Commercial Banking NPA rate improved 38 basis points in the quarter and 63 basis points year-over-year. Excluding Small-Ticket CRE, nonperforming asset rates improved across our Commercial Lending businesses as we continue to see a slower flow rate into nonperforming loans. ","The charge-off rate for the Commercial Banking segment was 63 basis points, down 80 basis points from the same quarter last year. Excluding the runoff Small-Ticket CRE portfolio, the charge-off rate in our core Commercial Lending businesses was 47 basis points in the quarter, an improvement of 53 basis points from the prior year. ","Commercial Lending charge-offs were up 20 basis points from the third quarter, driven by a small number of impaired CRE loans related to a single troubled relationship. We had reserved for these loans in the prior quarters, so these charges did not have a significant P&L impact in the fourth quarter. The slower flow rate into NPL and stable property values are driving lower charge-offs. ","Commercial Banking credit metrics have stabilized and improved over the last 6 quarters. We expect continuing strength in commercial credit with some quarterly choppiness in commercial charge-offs and nonperformers.","I'll close tonight on Slide 11. In 2011, Capital One delivered strong and stable margins and revenues. The bottom line benefit of significant credit improvement offset an increase in non-interest expenses. ","We gained strong momentum in loan growth in our Auto Finance and Commercial Banking businesses. And in our Domestic Card business, we returned to a modest growth trajectory with more normal seasonal patterns. We grew deposits with improved interest expense rate. ","Taken together, these trends produce strong underlying profitability across each of our 3 business segments and for Capital One as a whole. And we sustained and improved the strength and resilience of our balance sheet. We put ourselves in a strong position to act on 2 game-changing acquisitions with significant strategic upside and attractive economics. ","Fourth quarter results were somewhat noisy with several unique items and continuing growth in non-interest expenses even after adjusting for unique items.","Let's pull up and talk for a moment about the growth in expenses, what we're getting in return and why we believe that the growth trend in expenses will not continue. The increasing trend in non-interest expenses in 2011 resulted from choices we made to build our infrastructure, ensure that we're ready to integrate significant acquisitions and to prime the pump to restart growth. ","We've made significant investments in our infrastructure in 2011. We became a top 10 bank by acquiring and integrating 3 great local banking franchises. But none of the franchises we acquired had an infrastructure appropriate for a top 10 bank, let alone the top 5 bank we're set to become with the expected completion of our announced acquisitions. Therefore, we've been investing to build an infrastructure that's commensurate with the size, complexity and growth potential of the top 5 bank we'll soon become.","In 2011, we also made significant investments to restart growth across our lending businesses after a long period of cyclical declines in loan volumes. ","In our Card business, the natural cyclical decline in loans provided significant resilience through the downturn, but also now requires investments to prime the pump to restart growth coming out of the downturn. We ramped up marketing and bolstered operating infrastructure for new private label and partnership growth platforms in our Card business. We rolled out several successful new products including Venture, Cash and Spark cards. And we launched and ramped up new partnerships with Kohl's and Sony in the U.S. and Hudson's Bay Company and Delta Airlines in Canada. ","In our Auto Finance business. We grew our sales force and enhanced our capabilities to build deep relationships with auto dealers, and we invested in infrastructure to attract and serve primary banking relationships in our Commercial Banking business.","We're seeing these investments gain traction in the growth in franchise-building customer relationships across our businesses. In Domestic Card, we return to modest growth with expected seasonal patterns in the second half of 2011. Growth trends in purchase volumes and new accounts are even stronger. New account growth is a leading indicator of future growth in loans and revenues as spending and balances build on these accounts over time.","Our Auto loan originations are at a run rate of about $14 billion annually and Auto loans and revenues are growing as well. And our Commercial Banking business continues to grow loans, deposits and revenues as we attract new customers and deepen relationships with existing customers. ","For the full year, we posted growth in ending loan balances of 9% in Domestic credit cards, excluding Installment Loan runoff, 22% in our Auto Finance business and 14% in Commercial Banking. ","As we enter 2012, we expect noise in our results, driven by significant purchase accounting impacts, ramp up of integration expenses and partial year impacts on nearly all P&L line items as we complete our announced acquisitions. ","Looking beyond the noise, we expect continuing strength in our legacy businesses. We expect that our Domestic Card business will continue to post strong returns and modest underlying growth with seasonal patterns. In our Auto Finance business, we expect the strong 2011 trajectory in loans and revenues will continue. And we expect our Commercial business to continue the strong and steady performance trends it delivered throughout 2011.","Even as these businesses grow, we expect to hold run rate operating expenses to a level similar to the fourth quarter of 2011 because we've made significant progress on our infrastructure build and we're ready to begin the sure-footed integrations of 2 highly attractive acquisitions. ","We believe 2011 annual marketing expense is roughly in equilibrium given the opportunities we see today in our legacy business. The growth trends we've seen in 2011 show that priming the pump has already taken hold.","While these legacy trends will not be visible as a result of the expected acquisitions, they will remain an important part of how we deliver value in 2012 and over the long term. In addition to the legacy trends, we expect to add significant new customer relationships, loans and deposits when we close our announced acquisitions. We expect to close the ING Direct acquisition in the fourth quarter and to close the acquisition of HSBC U.S. Card business in the second quarter.","We continue to expect that the combination of both acquisitions will deliver compelling financial performance in the near term and over time. We remain on track to achieve the expected acquisition synergies and earnings accretion in 2013. And we expect that the acquisitions will be accretive to Capital One's long-term returns and capital generation as well.","The choices we made and the results we've delivered in 2011 put us in an even stronger position to deliver and sustain shareholder value through growth potential, strong returns and strong capital generation. ","With that, Gary and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Dana, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I have 2 questions. I think I'll try to hit them first, and then you guys can answer them. I just wanted to drill down on that expense discussion a little bit more. And I just wanted to be clear on some of the numbers. When you guys talked about the fourth quarter run rate being the approximation of what we'll see in 2012, you're probably talking about that x the onetime item. So when we think about operating expense, it's somewhere in the neighborhood of $2 billion. And then just on the marketing dollar spent this year, I mean basically you're saying it's equivalent in 2012 relative to 2011. And then maybe if you could just talk about how we should consider it out to 2013 with the combined entities in place. And then just on some of the onetime items, I wasn't clear, is that PPI -- I'm sorry, the protection insurance charge kind of onetime, all else equal, if nothing changes from a collection standpoint? And then just on the uncollectible fees and finance charges, I recall we talked about this last time and it would -- and we thought -- I thought it would be that it would trend with credit quality. And it seemed to have gone up despite the fact that credit improved, so I just wanted some clarity on that.","Gary L. Perlin","Okay, Sanjay. It's Gary. Why don't I just clarify some of the numbers for you, and then I'll hand it over to Rich to perhaps take up the marketing question and anything else you may want to follow-up on. So specifically, with respect to fourth quarter run rate, you are correct, we would simply back out the onetimers. And with a total operating expense in the quarter of about $2.2 billion, I described about $150 million of unique items in the expense line, not exactly that number but good enough, about $92 million in litigation expense, about $40 million in some asset write-downs and other costs. And in fact, some of the U.K. PPI even hit the expense line item as well. So I think if you were in the, say, $2 billion, $2.50 billion kind of ballpark, I think that would be an appropriate understanding of what we consider to be a run rate. As long as I'm on the topic of the onetimers, let me just speak quickly to the U.K. PPI and what happened in our finance charge and fee reserves. So with respect to the U.K. PPI, you may remember this from the second quarter of last year where some new retrospective regulatory requirements had come in that enables consumers to see compensation for PPI that was sold in certain years. With respect to certain products, that included both ILs that were originated by Capital One in the U.K. as well as the company that we acquired, as well as some credit card products as well. We built a reserve back when those requirements came in based on our estimate of what our claims experience and redress costs would be. Now that it's been a couple of quarters, we have had increased volumes of complaints driven by, I guess, what we would consider to be both media and regulator comments in the area. And so we had to increase our reserve based on the fact that we now believe it's probable that we'll have a higher rate of claims. So I can't say exactly what's going to happen. It's obviously, like all of our estimates, our best view of what's probable and estimable, but it is certainly consistent with the experience that we have seen to date. Most of that shows up as a contra-revenue, either in net interest income or non-interest income depending on the nature of the refunds. There's also a small amount that hits operating expense. But what we've done now is to kind of bring it up to the level that we think is appropriate. Finally, on the finance charge and fee reserve, levels or the level of suppression, Sanjay, I would say the change in the quarter was effectively nil. It was a $3 million or $4 million increase to the reserve. As I indicated last time, when we made the onetime change, about $80-some-odd million in Q3, that was to get us to what we thought was a more appropriate estimate of uncollectible fees and finance charges, a couple million either way in any given quarter. I wouldn't read any trend in that. So I think what we said was you'll basically see suppression be reflecting the actual reversals and recoveries without much change in the reserve. And that's just what happened.","Richard D. Fairbank","And Sanjay, this is Rich, just to comment to your question about marketing. We always manage marketing really to the size of the opportunities that we see available, and that would be no different going forward. The reason for my comment here was to draw a distinction between what I've said over the past year or 2, where I've said as we go from the significantly retracted state that we were through the Great Recession and start to now invest in testing and over time, rolling out programs, there  you will see a continual build of marketing. And that build will often will inherently be in advance of some of the benefits that come from that. My point is really that we've kind of -- we're now kind of rolling out those programs. I think the level of marketing represents kind of an equilibrium. Now if we see more opportunity out there going forward or if we see less, we will adjust accordingly. But it's just the real sense in the sense that -- I mean the pump is in many ways kind of primed after quite a lot of quarters at work on this. And I sense, you can feel the -- we're pretty optimistic about the traction we're getting in our programs across the company certainly. But my point here on marketing is especially credit card related, but I think we're kind of in our stride at this point, and I think that will continue.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Foran with Nomura.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I think people are still struggling with the expenses just solely, I guess at least based on the number of questions I'm getting. And maybe if you could just clarify again these $2.05 billion base, one would be the comment in the press release that you're ensuring readiness to execute on attractive acquisition opportunities. Is that referencing ING and HSBC? Or are you talking about further acquisitions? And then two, how does that $2.05 billion base change as the deals fold in? I think people are struggling to figure out if some of these kind of pulling forward expenses for those deals? Or do we still just take the expense base of HSBC and ING and add them on top of the $2.05 billion?","Gary L. Perlin","It's Gary. I appreciate the question, the opportunity to go a little deeper. So as I said to Sanjay, first thing we need to do is take out the onetimers. I mean over the course of 2011, we had a bunch of unique items in expense, and it was unusually high in the quarter. So that's why I kind of took those off the top. The increase in expenses that has occurred, and again, if you kind of take away a lot of these other expenses, the unique ones, what you'll see is we've had a pretty steady growth in our salaries and benefits. You'll see in the results this quarter that we had about a $60-some-odd million increase there. And as Rich and I have said, those investments are of 2 kinds, one certainly is supporting the rollout of new products and the growth in our businesses which, of course, also carries some marketing expense. On the infrastructure side, Brian, let me kind of clarify the kinds of things we're talking about there. So for example, we were long on our way to becoming a mandatory Basel II bank. With ING Direct, we will trigger that, and so we need to move quickly to make sure that Capital One is ready for that, just in terms of the size and greater diversification of our balance sheet, which brings both some risk management responsibilities, but also some opportunities, quite frankly, to generate more returns by good balance sheet management. So we're bulking up on that and, of course, we are already positioning ourselves for the acquisitions as a result of that. The third area, probably much bigger than the other 2 in terms of dollars. If you think about the IT and sales and servicing infrastructure that we need to have as a company, not for individual products, but with the 2 acquisitions we're talking about, and yes, the point in the press release was referring to these 2 large transactions, we're going to be adding tens of millions of new customers, increasing our overall customer account base by more than 1\/3. The infrastructure required for something that big and that complex is something we would -- have been building over time. We've accelerated some of these efforts simply to make sure that we're ready, not only to be able to integrate well but also to make sure we generate the opportunities that both of these acquisitions bring with them. I would not at this moment suggest that the integration expenses or synergies that we expected out of the 2 deals will have changed dramatically, because so many of those are unique to the franchises that we're buying. So I wouldn't consider this to be a pull forward as some of those expenses. But I'd say, it's an acceleration of where we as a top 5 bank, as Rich described, simply need to be, and we would have been there anyway, we've just moved a little faster. And so we certainly are raring to go and looking forward to integrating these acquisitions, and we're just going to have a more robust infrastructure, which is something that we and all big banks are going to need going forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So a little bit of a follow-up on the last question. You're readying for the integration. And the first question is, how far through the preparedness would you say you are at this stage? How many more quarters of investment spend should we expect to be fully ready to bring on the deals?","Richard D. Fairbank","Betsy, I think kind of the point of our comment that the run rate that you see in the fourth quarter is reflective of the run rate that we see out in '12 and '13 on legacy Capital One, it sort of definitionally implies that we're not building off that run rate from here. So of course, soon there's going to be noise on those numbers as we bring forward, bring the acquisitions into the company. But that is exactly our point that this build has been very sizable, frankly, in the quarter before this and this quarter. And we're at a level that that's going to be our run rate for an extended period of time.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, are the regulators waiting for any of this buildout to occur in order to approve the deals? Is there any checklist with regard to Basel II readiness that you have to supply to them?","Richard D. Fairbank","No, this is just our own preparedness.","Operator","We'll go next to John Stilmar with SunTrust.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just real quick question, and I hate to go back on expenses. Gary, if I could just be crystal clear of my understanding, $2.050 billion in expenses plus the dollar expenses from 2 acquisitions, also then taking into account the synergies that you expect to have, that's what's you're guiding us towards in terms of an expense base of Capital One legacy plus the 2 acquisitions together, ultimately when we kind of get through the other side, is that really the message you're trying to send?","Gary L. Perlin","That's the message, John. Effectively, we are talking about the condition of Capital One as we enter a period of time of obviously intense integration activity. And so needless to say, we're going to be looking to introduce some sure-footed integrations. There will be some integration expenses. I'm sure those estimates will change as we get into the process. We'll bring you up to speed on those. It seems premature for us to assume any changes there. And then we believe there are going to be some synergy opportunities to take run rate expense out of the combined companies going forward and especially given our knowledge and experience in both of these businesses. So I think you got the message exactly right.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Perfect. And then just a follow-up. Rich, in terms of the comments that you made around the Consumer Banking segment itself, in which the runoff of Mortgages was going to be offset a little bit by the growth in Auto, but you guided us towards, I believe, a lower overall balance for 2012. One, can you confirm that goes over that again? And two, how should we be thinking about the yield in that segment? Because I would imagine that some of those mortgages have a pretty high yield given where you bought them and took the mark. And how should we think about the transition and the mix of those businesses together, both on a balance and a revenue perspective?","Richard D. Fairbank","John, yes, I mean we really -- the segment, interestingly, is a blend of something that's in pretty ferocious runoff mode and another that's in pretty ferocious building mode. So I think that I just -- we just wanted to point out that while some of the core businesses we're investing in are -- have a lot of growth trajectory, mortgage runoff is going to be a word we're going to spend a lot of time talking about because we have this runoff in this segment now added to the some -- a very big runoff portfolio that we're going to be picking up on the ING side. So Gary, you want to comment on the yield dynamics including the mark?","Gary L. Perlin","Again, before you go there, Rich, just that I think John, to clarify, Rich was talking about the growth trajectory, not the sort of balances. So think about it as the legacy Mortgage portfolio runoff partially offsetting the growth in Auto. That's the trend we've seen in '11. That trend probably will continue, then we'll add ING mortgages with the acquisition. And that will be a much bigger portfolio, but then the trajectory will be sort of modestly downward because that will sort of double down on the runoff piece so that the Auto growth probably won't fully offset that.","Richard D. Fairbank","And with respect to the future yield dynamics there, John, needless to say, there will be a significant purchase accounting impact on those mortgage loans. We'll be getting it into greater details as we close and know the fair value and so forth, but there will be the impact of some accretable yields in those ING mortgage loans that will get accounted for under SOP 03-3, so there will be some yield impact going forward. The other thing to remember about the ING Mortgage portfolio, like a large percentage of our existing Mortgage portfolio, that was also acquired from our previous transactions. We will take a credit mark, so there should be relatively a little charge-offs there. So the dynamics of the segment and of the product will change to the extent these numbers are big and material. We will spell them out for you as we go.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A question on expenses. I know it's been beaten up a little bit here, but last quarter I believe you were pretty clear that expenses will be flat sequentially. And I was wondering, with some of the investment spending you did in the fourth quarter above and beyond to the onetimers, just opportunities in the market, and it seems to be on TV a lot, has that been a big part of the growth in expenses in your marketing budget? And a related question, can you talk a little more about some of the market share gains? It seems like you're moving up market in your brand message with the double miles and really trying to target the transactors. Is that really, I think, part and partial to the increase in purchase volume you're seeing? Do you feel like you're getting follow through in that spending?","Gary L. Perlin","Yes, Chris, Gary again. So indeed, we were at just under $2 billion in operating expense at the end of our -- in Q3. Around $2.2 billion in Q4. I've identified $150 million or thereabouts of unique items. Fourth quarter, sometimes we get a little extra boost to expense. There's a lot of things find their way to the expenses as well. Is it slightly faster growth in expense than we might have anticipated? Perhaps. But again, we've had better business growth opportunities and we're certainly trying to get ahead of what's common, not just because of the acquisitions, but the higher regulatory expectations all around. So I don't think we're far off of what we were expecting, at least on the operating expense line. If you go back to the marketing line, there was $100 million or about 1\/3 increase from Q3 to Q4. We don't -- I certainly wouldn't consider that to be an unusual quarter-to-quarter move based on the opportunities, especially knowing the historical trend towards higher marketing expense in the fourth quarter. But as far as what that means going forward, Rich?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, Chris. On the market share, again first of all, I think as we look across our big businesses, I think we're gaining share in Commercial. We're significantly gaining share in Auto. And by our tally, we're gaining share in the Card business as well. And I think we're gaining share in the Card business across several categories, including purchase volume originations and loan growth. Now some of these, the metrics are a little bit soft, so it's a little bit of imagination required in interpreting some of the numbers that we collect. But I mean you can see the very strong numbers that are coming on the purchase side -- purchase volume side. And Chris, you are correct, this is pretty directly coming from the big push that we have been making for some time in the heavy spender, really top of the market in credit cards. It's a very competitive space obviously, but we believe that our products and our marketing approach can and in fact -- can be and in fact is being very successful in that space. And you've seen that we've now got 3 launches out there with -- in addition to the Venture card. We also now have our Cash card. And we just recently launched a Small Business card as well. So all of these -- I mean some of these are kind of early days still, but there's good response there and the needle is really moving on purchase volume and of all the purchases going on in our portfolio because there's kind of a migration toward transactor gradually and a little away from the heavy revolving, that is a greater share of that purchase volume is coming on the rewards. The best way to think, though, about Capital One and our marketing is, a little bit to phrase, the more things change, the more they stay the same. We -- because we had a pretty resilient experience through the recession, we are pretty much doing what we did before. Now it's obviously informed and enhanced by everything that we've learned in the recession. And the competitive dynamics in each of the segments have also been kind of changing as well, and of course, you have the overlay of the CARD Act. But with respect to Capital One, I think that the real word is really continuity. And pretty much all the segments, where we were playing before and gaining share before, we are doing pretty much the same thing now with very similar approaches. Some of the places where we have been cautious and especially in the big, big line heavy revolving prime revolver space, we continue to probably lose share at the margin in that space because we worry about resilience in some of those segments. But overall, I think what is clear to us is that, and I've been saying this quarter-after-quarter, you kind of probably could detect the, I would say, each quarter look, not too much to write home yet about but I can just feel the traction growing in the Card business, and we certainly see that this quarter as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Don Fandetti with Citi.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Rich, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about recoveries in the Card business in terms of the outlook. I mean, obviously, the pool shrinks as you come out of a downturn, but there's been some talk about whether it's legal or regulatory issues. Do you foresee any problems in the industry around that?","Richard D. Fairbank","So with -- yes, you make a good point on recoveries by the way. Just first of all, the recovery numbers. Recovery dollars have been coming down at Capital One. And it's a cyclical thing. It's just a mass of a shrinking inventory of fresh charge-offs against which to recover. And we still -- our recovery rates still are coming in strong, but it's on a smaller base. And so in a way, it's a flip side of the good news that's going on out there. There's a lot of noise in every credit product, an incredible amount of noise about the collections area. And certainly, the scrutiny of credit card is certainly in that category. And we have put a huge amount of work over the years to make sure that we have very rigorous and buttoned down, disciplined collections processes. And I feel -- I think we feel good about where we are. We have seen some changes out there. I know that it appears that one of our competitors changed their practices in how they do collect, how they prosecute collections and so on. I'm not sure what was behind that one. We are continuing to use the same collections practices that we have and just work to be very sure that we are very, very buttoned down in every aspect of what we do.","Operator","We'll go next to Joel Houck with Wells Fargo.","Joel Houck - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It looks like the last couple of years, your return on tangible equity has been close to 20%. Obviously, there's a lot of reserve release in those numbers. So if you could kind of look forward, I mean how you look at the business, obviously assuming there's not another recession, with normalized reserves, is it close to a kind of a 15% return on tangible equity? Or do you think with the synergies you're getting from these 2 large acquisitions that you can get close to the 20% area?","Richard D. Fairbank","Well, Joel, I mean I'm pretty optimistic about what we -- what I think we can produce when all the dust settles from all the dust storms that we live through. But the way I look at Capital One is that we have worked very hard to put ourselves in the position to have very competitive scale positions in the key businesses that we're in, and when I -- and to massively build, as we've done for 23 years, a very rigorous net present value discipline that frankly looks for well above hurdle rate returns. When I pull up on this and look at our Card business, while it's an industry that certainly had a lot of pressure on it, I think we feel very good about the ability to continue to generate significantly above -- well, well above hurdle rate returns in that business even though I've often said, \"Look, I think net-net from all the effects that are going on, they are a little down, probably off of our historical levels, but still well above hurdle rate.\" In the Auto business, we have generated a very profitable, successful operation there. And in Commercial business, you've kind of seen some of the numbers that we have here -- there. So when I pull it all together and then, Joel, look at the acquisitions that -- and the value-creation opportunity here, I believe that our positioning in the marketplace should be the company that can generate at the high end of industry return levels. And even as profit pressures are pulling down returns in banking overall, I like our chances to be at the high end of the return on tangible equity metrics when the dust settles for this company.","Operator","We'll go next to David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Wondering, Gary, could you just update us on what you expect to need in a way of additional capital for HSBC? Is that smaller than you thought before? And then sort of a follow-up to Joel's question, could -- Rich, could you speak a little more to your comment on Slide 11, just how we should or how you will be measuring the strong returns qualitatively? And so you're investing for high returns, but when do those show up in reported earnings as you keep investing?","Gary L. Perlin","Sure, David. Very quickly, I really don't have much of a change to our outlook for the capital that we would add for the purposes of capitalizing the HSBC portfolio. We have the same target that we've had since we announced the deal, which is to be in that mid-9% range in Tier 1 common in the quarter that we closed. I have no reason at this point to suggest any change in the previously announced estimate of $1.25 billion of capital. But there's lots of moving pieces. One of them that we'll be able to fix over the coming period of time here is any effect from closing ING, the purchase accounting related to ING, the capital transactions, the balance sheet management actions that we've taken, and so we'll just have to keep you posted on what that final outcome will be. But I'll just go back to where we started on the deals, which is there's a wide range of capital required for these deals, under which we would find both of them to be and together to be very attractive. So we'll be able to get to that. And as I hand it over to Rich, just thinking about this question of returns, I think if you survey all the banks as to what kind of equity requirements are going to be out there, I think it's going to be a pretty big part of the equation in terms of what that return on equity will be. But we'll obviously be learning about that over the course of the next couple of years. The key here is the returns will be good, and that's what Rich was talking about.","Richard D. Fairbank","David, we are very focused on delivering what, the term I use is, destination economics. And we have worked very hard to get our company to competitively a very good state, and I think strategically are in a place where I've said we don't need to go to a different place to be able to compete and generate the returns that we need. So we're working, we're very focused on generating destination economics. We have had to build. There's been pump priming over the last year to 1.5 years, and we're more -- we now are kind of hitting our stride in terms of the growth opportunities. There's still a coiled spring in terms of the balance build on some of the accounts we're building, but we're pretty much hitting our stride there. Our point about expenses here is even as you look at the sizable run rate kind of expense after onetimers expense build in the last couple of quarters, our point is really to say that don't take that line and go extrapolate that thing upward. That is really a -- there's a story behind that expense build, but think much more that's sustainable from where we are. So the other thing that's a little delayed gratification, of course, is the 2 big acquisitions that we've done and that's going to create a lot of noise but we are very focused on as soon as we can to work to drive great financial return out of these acquisitions, because that value creation is there, and we are committed to delivering on it. ","Now along the way, we'll keep our eye out for unique acquisitions that could come along. But frankly on the acquisition front, we're not really trying to go anywhere. And frankly, our focus is really on the deals that we have, not on the deals that could be. So we are very focused on destination economics. And we are -- and we believe strategically, we're in a great place in order to deliver that.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Two little things. One is the Auto delinquency rate on Page 9 of the handout. I mean it looks like it's gone up a lot this quarter, and that's also been the most rapidly growing portfolio. So I just wanted to confirm that you said basically, this is just the seasonal impact you see. This is not -- is this -- is the delinquency experience in any way out of the bands of what you would normally expect after you've grown the portfolio the way you had?","Richard D. Fairbank","The Auto delinquency -- first of all, I want to say, Auto delinquency itself is a poor -- we have learned to -- that it's not a very good predictor, frankly, of losses in general, but -- unlike the credit card business. But that said, all the credit performance that you see in our Auto business is entirely seasonal. We are at an extraordinarily kind of low point in the kind of long, long view of Auto in terms of just how good this industry's credit performance is. And I think it's a reasonable thing to do to expect industry losses to -- probably to migrate up a bit from here. That's partially offset by some of the growth opportunities that we have at Capital One, and we're doing quite a bit of growth in the prime space with -- and that's helping pull down the losses. But overall, we are seeing very good results from our recent vintages, really from the whole portfolio now that's had such an extraordinarily strong -- looking from a credit point of view. We're at the point now that given the average life in autos like 2.5 years, you're looking at the last couple of years of auto originations and their extremely strong credit performance. And the credit results are really at this point just seasonal effects that you're observing.","Operator","We'll go next to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I hate to go back to the expenses, but it sort of looks like you're a little under $2 billion in the third quarter before marketing, if you're saying $2.50 billion. I guess that seems like there's about $65 million a quarter, that $250 million kind of round numbers sort of run rate of annualized expenses that relate to the set of new projects, I guess, that we didn't really know about before. Is it fair to say that that's kind of in the neighborhood of 5% or 6% kind of off the accretion of those deals? Is that what caused you to need to make those investments? I mean am I interpreting that right? Or is there something else that we -- some other way we should be thinking about that?","Gary L. Perlin","Moshe, it's Gary. I mean, again, if you take a look at what's been underlying some of the expense growth, you'll see that we have had considerable growth in our level of employment. Some of that is just some acquisitions like the Hudson's Bay Company. Some of them are in-sourcing and on-shoring, some other roles as well. But we had a significant increase in the third quarter in our hiring of net jobs. And obviously, that kind of goes into Q4 as well. I think the issue just to be clear, not to try and focus on the semantics, but to make sure that the understanding is absolutely clear, again, I think if you would look at any bank that is growing in the way that we are, Rich described it kind of going from top 10 to top 5, the bar is being raised in terms of expectations on the controls and management and regulatory interactions that take place. We think these are things that would have happened even with organic growth. They may be happening a little faster than that because of the growth and the size of our balance sheet along with the acquisitions. We were not in a position in looking at those deals to include in those deal numbers things that are really all about infrastructure of a company. So again, what I'd say is we're accelerating a little bit of the expense. But rather than thinking about it as specifically deal related, I would think about it as what does it take to be well positioned, well controlled, prepared for opportunities when you're going to have tens of millions of additional customers and what kind of support you need for that. That is something that we would have been building over time. We're building it a little faster. So that's why it's hard to link some of our preparatory work here, which is really just about being a bigger and better bank, and attribute that to individual deals other than the timing. And I think that the timing of this has been accelerated from what it might have been, which is why, you've seen it in a couple of quarters in a row but -- which you've heard Rich and me saying is that we've made really good progress. Certainly, will we look for better synergies as we go forward? Absolutely. But I think if you take a look at what's going to be required of any top 5 bank, we intend to be there. We're just getting there a little faster, and that's where it's coming from.","Operator","And we'll take our final question today from Bob Napoli with William Blair & Company.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the Auto business. Some of your big competitors, Wells and JPMorgan, their growth in Auto, and Wells pointed out a lot more competition coming in online in the fourth quarter. I think we've seen a fair amount of private equity come in to the Auto business over the past year. Should we expect to see that business, the growth rate for Auto slow down? And I mean are you seeing the same competitive pressures that Wells in particular was talking about?","Richard D. Fairbank","Bob, I -- there is no doubt that competition is intensifying. What happened in the Auto business is a lot of players headed for the hills. And the Auto business was sort of the first into the Great Recession to be worsening and it was the first one to sort of come out the other side. And I think though the competitive dynamics have been positive over this period of time, and I support your point that competition is increasing and it's a very natural thing, and we completely plan for that. The Capital One growth is -- there's a growth strategy that's happening at Capital One that's maybe not -- that was maybe quite differentiated from some of the competitors in that we are doing a significant still geographical expansion in the company. The exact thing we do in some geographies, we've been expanding across the nation. The most sure I've found in all my years of experience, the most sure-footed sort of business growth opportunity is to take something you've proven in certain geographies, test it in the next geographies, and then roll them out from there. So the growth play at Capital One is a blend of geographical expansion and more prime to supplement a lot of the subprime that we already have in that space. So it's something we've been actually doing for years. You see it picking up momentum because we've done a lot of testing and we are in rollout mode now. So the confidence that I have about growth in the Auto business is more, Bob, driven by continuing that sort of Capital One growth strategy. I think on top of that, I think that even normalized for that I think there's some continuing success we're seeing in penetrating our dealers. And so I think it's a good story at Capital One. But I think all of you would be well served to take a more cautious outlook about where pricing and competition will take this Auto business over the next 12 months.","Jeff Norris","Okay.

Steve?","Steve Crawford","Thanks Jeff, I\u2019ll begin tonight with slide 3. Capital One earned $920 million or $1.58 per share in the fourth quarter. Net of adjusting items, we earned $1.67 per share. Pre-provision earnings were down from the third quarter as higher revenues were more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses, driven by seasonal and growth-related costs. Provision for credit losses increased as we recognized higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build. On December 1, we closed on the acquisition of the GE Healthcare business, including $8.3 billion of loans and $500 million of goodwill. In addition to one month of operating earnings, there were two adjusting items related to the close of the deal. We had a $49 million allowance build related to pass rated loans and $20 million of deal related costs.","As a reminder, for the acquired GE loans, we are required to account for term loans with credit deterioration under SOP 03-3, and current and revolving loans under our traditional loan accounting processes. Of the acquired loans, $835 million are accounted for as 03-3 loans. Turning to full year results, 2015 pre-provision earnings of $10.4 billion were up 3% year-over-year as higher revenue was partially offset by higher non-interest expense. Net income for 2015 was down 11% as higher pre-provision earnings were more than offset by additional provision from credit losses. Full-year efficiency ratio was 54.3%, excluding adjusting items.","As you can see on slide 4, reported net interest margin increased 6 basis points in the fourth quarter to 6.79%, in line with the prior-year increase. Turning to slide 5, as of the end of 2015, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 11.1%, which reflects current phase-ins. On a standard fully phased-in basis, it was 10.7%. We reduced our net share count by 7.6 million shares in the quarter. We expect to complete our previously announced buyback program in the second quarter of 2016. [Technical Difficulty] $91 million over the prior year. Assuming no new issuance, we would expect to pay out approximately $205 million in preferred dividends in 2016. Specific quarterly payout schedules can be found in our regulatory filings.","With that, let me turn it over to Rich.","Richard Fairbank","Thanks Steve, I\u2019ll begin on slide 7 with our domestic card business. Strong growth continued in the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, ending loans and average loans were both up 13% and purchase volume was up about 18%. We continued to like the earnings profile and the resilience of the business we\u2019re booking. Fourth-quarter revenue increased 11% from the prior-year quarter, slightly lagging average loan growth as revenue margin declined modestly. Revenue margin for the full year was 16.9%. As a reminder, we\u2019re on track to fully exit our back book of payment protection products in the first quarter. Payment protection revenue contributed about 25 basis points to full-year 2015 revenue margin, and we expect this contribution to go to zero by the second quarter of 2016.","Fourth-quarter non-interest expenses increased 7% compared to the prior-year quarter, with higher marketing and growth-related operating expenses as well as continuing digital investments. Credit continues to perform in line with our expectation in both our existing portfolio and our new originations. As we've discussed for several quarters, two factors are driving our current credit trends and expectations. The first is growth math, which is the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio.","The second is seasonality. All else equal, seasonality results in an increasing charge-off rate in the fourth quarter rising to peak charge-off rate in the first quarter. As we\u2019ve said for the last three quarters, we expected growth math and seasonality would drive charge-off rate to the mid-to-high 3s in the fourth quarter. The fourth-quarter charge-off rate came in at 3.75%, in the middle of an expected range. We expect the upward pressure from growth math will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. We still expect the full-year 2016 charge-off rate to be around 4% with quarterly seasonal variability.","We don't normally discuss our charge-off outlook two years in advance. But given the sustained rapid growth rate, we want to give investors a sense of the growth math impact in 2017. I want to note that our 2017 charge-off outlook is our best estimate today for things that are fairly far in the future, particularly given recent volatility in financial markets. All that said, based on what we see today and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy, and competitive conditions, we expect full-year 2017 charge-off rate in the low 4s with quarterly seasonal variability.","Loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rates drove an allowance build in the quarter. And we expect allowance additions going forward, primarily driven by growth. Slide 8 summarizes third-quarter results for our consumer banking business. Ending loans were down about $1 billion compared to the prior year. Growth in auto loans was offset by expected mortgage run-off. Consumer banking revenue for the fourth quarter was down 2% from the fourth quarter of last year. Higher revenue from growth in auto loans was offset by margin compression in auto and declining mortgage balances.","Fourth-quarter non-interest expense was up 1% from the prior-year quarter, driven by infrastructure and technology expenses in retail banking and growth in auto loan. Provision for credit losses was up from the linked quarter, primarily as a result of auto seasonality. Fourth-quarter auto originations declined about 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, auto originations were up 1% to $21.2 billion. Prime originations continued to grow. Sub-prime originations have been essentially flat for several quarters before declining in the fourth quarter.","We\u2019ve discussed the effects of increased competition on pricing and underwriting, particularly in sub-prime. We will continue to pursue opportunities in auto lending that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining greater share of prime originations with existing dealers. Our consumer banking businesses faced headwinds in 2016. Planned mortgage run-off continues and auto margins are compressing from exceptional levels due to the mix shift toward prime and competitive pressure. ","We expect these trends will negatively affect revenues and efficiency ratio in 2016 even as we continue to manage costs tightly.","Moving to slide 9, I\u2019ll discuss our commercial banking business. Ending loan balances increased 24% year-over-year, including the acquisition of GE Healthcare Finance business. Fourth-quarter ending loan balances also include about $900 million from a short-term agency warehousing transaction that is already paid down, which also will affect loan growth optics when we report first-quarter results.","Excluding the GE loans and the agency warehousing transactions, loans grew about 6% year-over-year. As we\u2019ve been signaling, our organic growth has slowed compared to prior years because of choices we\u2019re making in response to market condition. While increasing competition is pressuring loan terms and pricing in both CRE and CNI, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals. Full-year revenue increased 7%. Revenue growth was below average loan growth driven by continuing spread compression. Credit performance remain strong for the majority of our commercial businesses but credit pressures continue in the oil and gas and taxi medallion portfolios.","While the charge-off rate for the quarter remained very low at 3 basis points, provision for credit losses increased $86 million from the prior-year quarter to $118 million, driven by allowance build. We build allowance over the last five quarters in anticipation of increasing risk in oil and gas and taxi medallion loans and the addition of the GE Healthcare loads drove a $49 million allowance addition in the fourth quarter. Compared to the linked quarter, criticized performing loans were up $290 million to $2 billion and non-performing loans were up $97 million to $550 million driven by downgrades of oil and gas loans.","The credit quality of the GE Healthcare portfolio is in line with our expectation. The GE Healthcare loans we acquired run at a higher criticized rate than our legacy commercial business but that affect doesn't show up in the fourth quarter criticized loan metrics because of purchase accounting. We've provided visibility into that impact by disclosing the managed criticized rate which excludes the purchase accounting impact. In the fourth quarter, the managed criticized rate was 5.4%, 130 basis points higher than the reported criticized rate of 4.1%.","As we book new healthcare loans and the marked loans paydown, this will create upward pressure on our reported criticized loan metrics over time all else equal. We like the GE Healthcare business and we\u2019re thrilled to welcome the new team to Capital One. We remain highly focused on managing credit risk and working with our oil and gas customers. Of our approximately $3.1 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans, around half is in exploration and production, and around a third is in oilfield services.","We expect that energy loans will continue to present challenges and we've been building reserves to reflect the concern. At year-end, approximately $190 million of our $604 million in total commercial allowance for loan losses was specifically allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. This is about 6.1% of total energy loans. Given that oil prices have fallen since quarter end, unless they rebound, it is likely that energy loans will drive increasing criticized and non-performing loans for the reserve build and possibly increasing charge-offs in 2016.","I'll close tonight with some thoughts on Capital One\u2019s full year 2015 results and our outlook for 2016. Two factors shaped our 2015 results; growth and investments. Growth in Domestic Card loan balances and purchase volumes led the industry driving strong year-over-year growth in revenue, as well as increases in operating expense, marketing and allowance for loan losses. The costs of growth are frontloaded, but in our experience of more than two decades, revenue growth surpasses frontloaded costs over time and growth pays off on the bottom line.","Provision for credit losses increased in 2015. Most of the increase came from higher allowance for loan losses, primarily driven by domestic card loan growth and the expectation of higher domestic card charge-off rates because of growth math. Full year efficiency ratio was 54.3% net of adjustments, better than our estimated range of around 55%. Three factors drove the favorability. Revenues for the quarter were strong. We benefited from a handful of miscellaneous fourth quarter expense items coming in favorable to expectations and we are getting traction on efficiency efforts across the company.","Even from the lower 2015 starting point of 54.3%, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding adjusting items. We are managing costs tightly across our businesses. We expect our card growth will create positive operating leverage over time. And while not solely motivated by cost savings, our digital investments are already delivering tangible savings and productivity gains in servicing core infrastructure and our legacy operations and we expect these benefits to grow over time.","Pulling up our 2015 results and the choices that drove them have put us in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns, driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks as well as significant capital distribution subject to regulatory approval.","Now Steve and I will be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good evening. Rich, can you talk a little bit more about the slowdown in auto loan originations and maybe if you could add a little bit more color on how that ties in with your outlook across the credit spectrum?","Richard Fairbank","Yeah, Bill, there's nothing really dramatic. There is really - the auto story is the same story we've been saying for quite some time. So for at least a year now, we have been flagging that in the subprime marketplace we see practices that are inconsistent with where we want to go from an underwriting point of view and we raised the flag about that in our calls, and we have said and continue to say today that within the context of maintaining, doing credit the way we want to do it, we are going to still go for as much origination as we can do in the subprime auto space. And the kind of net effect of this going on for a number of quarters, as we have signaled, it just - this is the first quarter that actually subprime originations are down, but it's again the same marketplace, but I think this is the effect that we have been signaling for some time. And so this is in \u2013 what I want to stress is, we still very much like the business. We do it on our own terms, and we have a great history and a real - and I think great opportunities to create value in this space.","But we, as always, number one, put credit and our underwriting choices number one and the net effect of that at the moment is some reduced opportunity in the subprime space relative to what would otherwise be there. In the prime space, the opportunity continues. There are some competitive end marketplace issues on a smaller scale going on there, but we still really like the auto business. I think this is a continuing manifestation of coming off what I've kind called the sort of once in a lifetime unique set of opportunities and confluence of marketplace conditions that existed in the wake of the recession. And so, over time we are going to see a more normalized auto business.","Operator","And our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. Maybe to kind of turn to the card business, let\u2019s talk a little bit about how you see the competitive environment now, and one of your competitors did announce a secured card program this week, so kind of infringing on that perhaps lower demographic segment and just maybe talk about the lay of the land as you see it from the card business.","Richard Fairbank ","So, Moshe, the card industry continues to be very competitive, but fairly rational industry. Marketing levels are high, but stable. Pricing, teaser lengths, APRs, things like that generally stable, and certainly in the places we play, we feel the pricing is resilient. Rewards are very competitive. There have been some increases in early spend bonuses, but overall it\u2019s pretty stable. And with respect to the subprime marketplace, there have been a lot of folks who have issued secured cards over time, and I think now there is another player in that space. I think so we'll continue to monitor the competitive environment there, but we continue to pursue the same strategy pretty much we've been doing for many, many years.","An area also, when you talk about competition, we tend to - I tend to focus the conversation just on our own direct competitors. Of course a very relevant thing in the competitive environment is interchange as well, and so we also - as we\u2019ve talked about, want to keep an eye on interchange risk. A few of the larger merchants have negotiated lower interchange that will have an effect that we keep an eye on and also we are watching the evolving digital marketplace for payment alternatives and any impact there on interchange or disintermediation or tolls or anything that happens along those lines. So that's another dimension we should probably always add to our conversation about competition.","Finally, in partnerships, that\u2019s the place that I have most pointed to as the intensity of the auction-based marketplace there at times, and in fact very often recently has led to market clearing prices that have been pretty breathtaking. And as a result, we have not had as much growth as we might otherwise have had in that particular space.","The other thing about the card industry, I think worth pointing out is what\u2019s happening with just sort of industry growth. So, industry-revolving debt for most of 2012 and 2013, it held steady at about 1% year-over-year growth and then it maintained sort of little over a 3% growth since July of 2014, and in recent months, it has been over 4%. So that\u2019s certainly getting a little bit more octane there. And bank card outstandings are up 4.6% year-over-year. I think overall, if I pull way up about the credit card marketplace, I think it's a generally rational marketplace. I think we see opportunity for growth and very attractive returns. We monitor the marketplace obsessively and when we see windows of opportunity, which we do at the moment, we certainly go very hard to seize those opportunities.","Moshe Orenbuch","Just given it\u2019s about a year, any update you can give us on your success in Canada?","Richard Fairbank ","So are you referring generally to our Canadian business, Moshe?","Moshe Orenbuch","Costco Canada.","Richard Fairbank ","You are talking about Costco Canada? In September 2014 we launched a partnership with Costco and that deal did not come with a portfolio acquisition, so it was sort of at the margin origination business. That business has had nice traction in terms of our growth. It is not a big needle mover for Capital One overall, but it\u2019s certainly something that has had a fair amount of growth to it.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","Certainly. Next comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, couple of questions. One was on just your comments around credit and I know you gave the outlook for 2017 in the low 4s. I think the guidance had been for around 4 for 2016. So I am just wondering, are you seeing a slower rate increase in 2016. Does the pace of what you are expecting as we move through \u201816 and \u201817 change at all versus prior commentary?","Richard Fairbank","Betsy, explain the last part of your question one more time about \u2013 what did you say about \u201916.","Betsy Graseck","I think that you had given guidance in the past around losses in \u201816. I'm just wondering if your guidance around that had changed at all.","Steve Crawford","Not at all, Betsy. Guidance in \u201816 exactly the same. So all we are doing is adding \u201817 with some caution. That\u2019s a lot further in the future. And, again, there it\u2019s all about growth math. ","Betsy Graseck","Okay, all right. No, that's helpful and then just the follow-up is on your commentary around energy and if prices stay where they are today, you could see some criticizing classified increase as a result of reserve build. Could you give us a sense of the sensitivities there if you have any that you could share if prices stay flat where they are, what kind of reserve build we could see if prices go to 25, what kind of reserve build, anything you are willing to share there is helpful.","Richard Fairbank","Okay, Betsy. We\u2019ve built reserves since the fourth quarter of 2014 and at year-end, as we said earlier, approximately $190 million of our $600 million allowance for loan losses in commercial is specifically allocated to the oil and gas portfolio. When we set our allowance each quarter we assume a material degradation in future prices relative to the forward curve. That said, oil spot - basically spot and forward prices have declined about 20% since the end of the quarter. And if they stay at that level, we estimate we will have to build about $50 million in additional allowance all other things being equal through the end of the quarter.","Steve Crawford","Betsy, we are trying to give that to be helpful. And I know you\u2019ve heard that in a lot of other places, but part of the reticence of estimates like this is you've got the price impact alone, but then you\u2019ve got idiosyncratic things that can happen in particular credits that can be just as important. So what we are just talking about is really just a mathematical calculation of what would happen if the prices were closer to where they were currently.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And that question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with Keefe, Bruyette and Woods.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. I guess, my first question is just how we should think about revenue growth into 2016 and 2017. Should we assume it tracks kind of loan growth and maybe you could just discuss kind of how the funding of that growth might play into that? And then secondly I was wondering if you could help me with just how we should think about the profitability of the GE portfolio that you acquired. Thanks.","Richard Fairbank ","Yeah. So I think you're right. The best way to think about revenues is that the primary factor there is going to be loan growth. The things that we have been observing about margin, net interest margin haven't really changed. You\u2019ve got probably a mix benefit on the card side, a mix benefit from the lower mortgage loans. You\u2019ve got a little bit of a negative against that in terms of the auto loans and then the big uncertainty factor is what happens to rates. And your second question was on? ","Sanjay Sakhrani","GE. Profitability of that portfolio.","Richard Fairbank","I mean, we are really happy about the GE portfolio, but at less than 3% of interest earning assets, it's definitely accretive to our commercial business and to the company, but not really material overall.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And next question comes from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.","David Ho","Hi, good evening guys. Just had a question on gas prices and if those continue to stay at these levels, at what point do your loss expectations start to tick down as you think about your outlook, comments for 2016 and 2017?","Richard Fairbank","So you're talking about its impact on the consumer side?","David Ho","Correct.","Richard Fairbank","So David, I guess there is really two sides to this. The first is the potential of sustained low energy prices to cause economic stress in geographies that are heavily dependent on that industry. And keep in mind on that that our consumer lending businesses are mostly national businesses, so we don't really have any outsized concentrations in those geographies. We have about 5% of our card portfolios in parts of the country with high energy employment concentration. That said, when we look at these geographies, places like Houston, parts of North Dakota, Alberta Province and Canada, we do see slight upticks in card delinquencies. And where appropriate, we've taken steps to surgically tighten our underwriting in these geographies, although we want to be careful not to over-react to these very modest effects.","But of course the flipside of falling energy prices is the direct benefit to consumers. And while the benefits are hard to disentangle from other economic effects, it's clear that falling gas prices translate into the equivalent of a pretty sizable wage increase for most households. So it's tough to gauge the net effect of these two factors. If I \u2013 my hunch is that it's a net positive on consumer credit.","Steve Crawford","I think the thing that's been surprising today, is it hasn't shown up in consumer spending to the way that people would have expected. But obviously where it's going instead is to paying off debt, and given that we are in the credit business, that's not a bad thing either.","David Ho","Thanks. And then separately, can you talk about some of the aspects of competition in the online deposit arena and any changes to your anticipated deposit beta, just given the current rate environment and some of what your competitors may be doing?","Steve Crawford","I don't know that we talk much about changes in deposit data. I mean, we've often observed and when asked about it that the direct business does have higher beta than some of the more traditional forms of gathering deposits. But I think what you as investors are most interested in kind of the total cost of those liabilities, and it's not just about beta, it's also about mix. And one of the most profound things that's happened on the liability side is the shift in mix, with much of it going in the non-interest bearing. You haven't seen nearly as much of that at Capital One.","So we would in general expect to have higher betas than the peers just as a result of the higher contribution of our direct and online business. But I think the mix is kind of something on the other side. I don't think you'll ever see us venture out too far. There have been so many fundamental changes in the marketplace, regulatory, technology changes that I'm not sure of past is going to be prologue, but we like our funding position and the fact that it's diversified across traditional and direct channels.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please. ","Operator","And that question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. Just two questions. One is, I may have missed this, Rich, but could you just clarify what aided the interchange revenues in the quarter. And then my broader question is, as I think about all of the guidance, I just want to make sure I'm understanding everything correctly. It sounds as if the \u2013 there's clearly going to be PPNR growth, given the very spectacular asset growth that's occurring. But how should we think about the net income line on a year-over-year basis?","Steve Crawford","So on the net income side, like I think we've told you that on the top line, it's primarily going to be a function of loans. Rich is giving you a directional guide on where we expect to go from an efficiency standpoint. Actually, I know you listened to our call, so now with two years of charge-offs, you can actually get a pretty reasonable view on not only what net charge-offs might be, but also what the allowance needs might be in the coming year. Obviously, there is a little bit of a new factor in commercial with respect to losses that make that less a function of card losses. And then the last piece is, we've had an increase in preferred dividends. So we've given you some of the important building blocks there, which I think are due to fill in.","Richard Fairbank","Eric, on the interchange number, fourth quarter net interchange grew 18% from a year ago and a 11% a linked-quarter basis, which happens to be pretty much in line with our purchase volume growth of 19% from a year ago and 8% from last quarter. I would not get overly focused on any one quarter. I mean, when our interchange growth number was very low, I said this, when it's at this level, I say it again, there is a lot of factors that affect that quarterly number.","If you look at full year 2015 compared to 2014, our net interchange grew 11% compared to purchase volume growth of 21%. Removing the quarterly noise, net interchange growth has generally lagged general purpose credit card interchange growth and we expect this trend will continue. ","Our rewards programs have been and continue to be very successful with strong growth of our flagship products. We're also building a long-term franchise by upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers and consistent with the industry extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And as you can imagine, there is -- that entail some near-term cannibalization. But it's all part of building a stronger, deeper customer franchise and we're committed to doing that.","And also as I mentioned earlier, with a few merchants out there driving interchange through their individualized negotiations and things like that, that's also another factor that we have to keep an eye on. So I wouldn\u2019t get carried away with any one quarter, but we\u2019re much very much like the growth we're having in our spender business and it\u2019s part of the long-term franchise strategy.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","Certainly that question comes from Don Fandetti with Citi. ","Don Fandetti","So Rich, you had sort of talked a little bit about loan growth in cards and wanted to just get your sense. Would you be surprised to see sort of an industry pickup? And where do you see better sort of relative demand for credit? Is it on the subprime, prime side, or is it sort of across the board?","Richard Fairbank","You know, I -- my intuition is it is this effect of revolving credit picking up is an across-the-board thing. And by the way, when you look at revolving credit numbers when card purchase volume numbers pickup that also goes into that number. So I think that after several years of frankly really being in the doldrums, the card industry across the board is getting a little bit more octane.","Steve Crawford","That\u2019s obviously the industry overall, our growth rates were pretty strong.","Richard Fairbank","I think, you were talking about an industry point, Don. ","Don Fandetti","Yes, just generally across the board, clearly you guys have been above the group. So okay, thanks. ","Jeff Norris","Next question please. ","Operator","And that question will come from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.","Brian Foran","Good evening. I guess, for investors, recession has become part of the conversation. It's probably not the base case for many, but it's a risk. People are worried about, where six months ago, it was viewed as a zero chance. Clearly tonight, your base case, you've given us very clear charge-off guidance and commentary on growth math. But you've got endless data you can look at, is there anything you're seeing in the data that would make you at all nervous about 2016 being the year the US dips into a recession, or is it kind of all-clear from the consumer perspective based on what you're seeing?","Richard Fairbank","Well, I don't want to get too far on either sides of your little continuum that you portray there. But let me say this about the health of the consumer. First of all, there has obviously been turmoil in the markets recently, including concerns about the global economy, especially China and closer to home concerns about the potentially disruptive consequences of falling oil prices. Having said that, most indicators of the \"real economy\" at least in the US continue to look pretty strong. We've seen sustained improvement in labor markets in recent months and steady home price growth. Consumer confidence remained solid. And as we talked about earlier, falling energy prices, while they will stress certain sectors and certain geographies, they will also directly benefit consumers. And if anything, I feel, it would probably be a net positive for the overall health of the consumer. ","Of course, our most reliable view, Brian of consumers comes from our own portfolio from direct indicators of consumer behavior like payment rates and purchase volume, and from leading edge credit indicators like delinquency flow rates. These indicators all look consistent with our views of seasonality and growth math, and they are not giving us cause for concern. Obviously, the economy is something of a wildcard, and as the turmoil we're seeing in financial markets spills over into the real economy, we would expect that to show up in our credit metrics eventually. But we're not seeing any indications of that now.","Brian Foran","I appreciate that. I guess, a smaller follow-up, the revenue suppression or the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees, it's been a while since we've had to think about that. Can you just remind us, is the best thing just to grow it proportionally with the charge-off guidance or is there \u2013 does it behave differently somehow as growth math get profits [ph].","Steve Crawford","Your instinct is pretty good. I mean, there are some other factors if you went back in the history, you would see, it kind of depends a little bit on where you are on the cycle. But the biggest driver of it is going to be credit. There is a little bit more seasonality to it, because it's a six to seven-month calculation as opposed to charge-offs, which are 12 months. So there is a little bit of seasonality into it. But with most of our figures, we try and point people to annual numbers and it should follow more of what's going on in the credit front.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please.","Operator","And this question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel.","Chris Brendler","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Just want to ask a follow-up question on the US card business. The interchange growth, coming back this quarter, the strong purchase volume growth. Typically you've seen your marketing campaigns have a limited shelf life, but it seems like Quicksilver and the cash back rewards are still extending your lead in the US card business. Have you seen any degradation of the effectiveness of this program?","And on the interchange growth discussion earlier, I just want to make sure that there is sort of a \u2013 there is that negative impact here that's causing the disconnect between purchase volume and interchange growth that may have been smaller this quarter, or is there actually something that's going to add to interchange income in any given quarter like this one? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","So Chris, the purchase volume growth is really coming from success and traction that we're having across our business, not coming from any one product, any one part of the business, it's coming from success of our rewards program, coming from new account origination, and it's coming from credit line increases, and as we do credit line increases, of course, people are spending money as they use the card even more. So there is a lot of things that are lining up right now to lead to a pretty strong purchase volume growth, one of which is the success of some of our flagship programs. On the interchange question...","Steve Crawford","Yeah. The one thing -- as an example, the reason we try and point to longer-term trends is the rewards liability can kind of obscure the underlying trends on any particular quarter, which is why you\u2019re better off looking at it on a longer basis. Next question please.","Operator","And that question will come from Rich Shane with J.P. Morgan.","Rich Shane","Guys, thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. First, I\u2019d like to talk a little bit about what's going on with rewards and perhaps how this plays out. When we think about the intensity of the rewards space right now, it almost feels like issuers are giving away transactions. It may be not a loss leader, but it\u2019s certainly much more than breakeven. And that works really well in an environment where lending is so profitable, because credit expenses are so low. Would we expect that as credit begins to normalize, do you think that we'll start to see some of this competition abate?","Richard Fairbank","Well, that's a -- Rich, I don't know how to speculate about that particular thing. I think, I feel like the rewards business, look, you're absolutely right that the rewards business is intensely competitive. And one thing I've said about the rewards business, it's really hard to be a casual player in the business, really ramping it up this quarter, putting it on TV this quarter, pulling back the next quarter, this is about very sustained investment, building a brand and being willing to what it -- to do what it takes on the timing of cost versus payback and things that make it difficult for companies to sustain their investment in this particular space. ","As you know, we've invested for years and I think we\u2019re in a good position there to get a bunch of traction and enjoy the financial benefits of that. It is also the case and you are correct that the rewards business has now extended farther across the credit spectrum deeper into the revolver business in a number of things and a higher proportion of Americans are ending up with rewards cards, including a bunch who are regular old revolvers. ","Now, on the face of it, it\u2019s not that big a deal economically in the sense if someone is a revolver, they -- once they start revolving on the card, the reward economics aren\u2019t that relevant any more. So your thesis is an interesting one. My own belief is this will continue to be as far out as we can see, pretty intensely competitive business. ","I do not describe it as a business, where you just give everything away and make your money on the rest of the business. We work very hard to have our -- spend our business be an economically strong business in its own right, but this is certainly intensely competitive and I think some players will invest heavily to compete there and others will be a little bit more, not as intensely investing in that space.","Rich Shane","Hey, Rich. Thank you. An appreciation of you taking such a theoretical question and spending so much time on it. I'll pass on my second question. Thank you guys.","Steve Crawford","Next question please.","Operator","Certainly. That question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Bob Napoli","Thank you, good afternoon. I know you talked about returns and growth at the higher end of the bank range, but I guess maybe if you look at the return to generating today that Capital One is generating, you\u2019re generating return on GAAP equity in high single digits, return on tangible equity in the low teens, is that -- so that's, are you comfortable with those levels, or do you think you\u2019re under earning what you should be? Just some thoughts around the returns you\u2019re generating today versus what you would target longer term?","Steve Crawford","Yeah. So, look, I think most of the industry has kind of looked at on a return on tangible equity and there were, I think a little over closer to 13% this quarter. And what we have said, what Rich has consistently said was that he believes we should be at the higher end of banks with respect to growth and returns. We haven't seen the final league tables. My guess is this year, we\u2019ll probably not be at the higher end. That\u2019s not a commitment we make every year. Obviously, you\u2019ve heard an enormous amount of our discussion over the past two years about this being a window of opportunity for us to grow and that that growth in both the card business and digital is obviously something that costs money. Rich, I don\u2019t know if you want\u2026","Richard Fairbank","Well, our investors and how they get paid overtime is an incredibly central and important question always. Since our founding days, we've been very focused on building a company that can generate superior sustainable financial performance. And to do this, we need three things. Core earnings power that has the octane to deliver attractive current returns and fund investment in the future. There are a bunch of businesses in banking that, in our opinion, don't sort of have enough earnings power to do that. That's one reason we've tried to focus on the places that do.","Secondly, we need a strategic positioning in the marketplace that allows us to capitalize on opportunities. And third, we need the credit discipline to be able to respond to the windows that open and close in the marketplace. And we focus on these three things throughout our two decades as a public company. Right now is a critical time in the marketplace. We are generating above hurdle returns, but are also investing to capitalize on two very significant opportunities. ","The card growth window, which is itself the reward of years of investment and a sweeping digital transformation of our industry. Both investments are going incredibly well at Capital One. And we expect the benefits will increasingly show over time in our financial performance through growth, operating leverage, bottom-line return and capital return.","Bob Napoli","Next question please.","Operator","And we have a question from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell","Thanks for taking my question. Rich, a question for you, given what's happened in the market over the last three weeks or so, I'm curious how you\u2019re thinking about buybacks in the first quarter and the second quarter, given that your shares are now closer to tangible book value than they\u2019ve been at some point. I noticed that your buybacks in the fourth quarter were pretty consistent with the prior couple of quarters, should we assume that that buyback pace remains or is there any way that you can potentially accelerate that in the first part of 2016?","Steve Crawford","Look, we're not going to speculate too much about what's going to happen going forward. I do think it's worthwhile pointing out, remember that we have a CCAR plan that's been approved through the second quarter of 2016. So, there is not really a tremendous amount of flexibility outside of what's already been approved, some, but not a lot.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thanks, Steve. And then just one follow-up if I can, there is slightly above average growth in your commercial real estate multi-family portfolio, I realize it's not a huge portfolio for you, but a number of other banks had suggested that that's an area where they are getting a little bit more cautious market by market, I'm curious what drove that and if there was any part of that portfolio that was increased by the GE purchase?","Steve Crawford","Multi family.","Matt Burnell","Yes.","Steve Crawford","I don't think there is anything, Rich, I'm not aware of anything in particular to point out in multi-family and I don't think there was any additions from GE.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thanks very much.","Steve Crawford","Next question please.","Operator","And our last question tonight will come from Matthew Howlett with UBS.","Matthew Howlett","Thanks for taking my question. Just to clarify on the efficiency ratio guidance, the guidance is still for a modest improvement in \u201816 over \u201815, with that really being driven by the back end of 16, could you just sort of comment on the headcount reduction and is that sort of part of the improvement?","Richard Fairbank","So, we don't give guidance with respect to the timing. Our guidance, our full year number is -- headcount, some of the recent announcements you've seen on headcount impacts at Capital One are of course part of the continuing dynamic management of this company as we continue to adapt in the marketplace and continue to obsessively drive toward superior and sustainable returns and positioning this company to win in a rapidly changing environment.","Steve Crawford","I just want to add, the specific word on efficiency was we expect some improvement in \u201816 and more in \u201817, just to go back to the actual language.","Matthew Howlett","Got you. Thanks for that. And then, Rich, just moving to last question on the charge-off guidance that you're sort of looking out into \u201817, is that sort of the new normal of a low 4%, is that what we could look at as being a new normal where you want to be in terms of a midpoint of a cycle and is that sort of what we're targeting long term or is that something we can look at as a long-term benchmark for where are you as card charge-offs will run?","Richard Fairbank","No. It's a great question. We discuss all the time what's the normal, I've been for 20 years wondering exactly what's the normal in the card business and there are so many factors. I'm not sure that I think it sort of eludes a full generalization. The key things that we are saying is this. Off of a base and extraordinarily low charge-off level of these highly seasoned portfolios like ours and really the competitors have a similar kind of situation. But unusual factor number one, a highly seasoned back book that has like survived the Great Recession. ","On top of that, some dramatic growth numbers that in our more than 2-decade history of being a -- building a growth company, we have a lot of experience with how growth math works and that's why we very much want to get out in front of these numbers and explain all other things being equal, how growth math works. ","And so that, and we've even done the unusual of going all the way out into 2017 to describe that effect, because we want our shareholders to understand the mechanics of how growth math works, other things being equal. So that's not the same thing as declaring what's a normal for the card business, but what it is doing is giving you a sense of how a dramatic surge of growth on a very seasoned base, how the math of that works and the settling effect that starts happening overtime.","Steve Crawford","Well, that concludes our call this evening. Thank you very much for joining us on the call this evening and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any questions you may have. Have a good night.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call.

To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our fourth quarter 2018 results.","With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Scott Blackley, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Scott will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors and click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements.

Scott?","Scott Blackley","Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $1.3 billion or $2.48 per share in the fourth quarter. We had three adjusting items in the quarter, which are outlined on page 13 of tonight's slide deck. We had $284 million or $0.60 per share income tax benefit as a result of the resolution of the tax item, this was recorded in our other category. We had a $74 million or $0.12 per share net gains on the sale of exited business, this was also recorded in our other category and finally we had a build of $50 million or $0.11 per share related to the UK PPI Reserve. This was recorded in our Credit Card segment. Net of these adjusting items earnings were at $1.87 per share in the fourth quarter.","Let me take a moment to walk you through this quarter's results. Linked quarter pre-provision earnings on a GAAP basis decreased 10% to $2.9 billion with revenues up 1% and non-interest expenses up 10%. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily driven by higher marketing. Operating expenses were up 1% linked quarter as the absence of $170 million legal reserve we booked in the third quarter was more than offset by normal seasonal spending and $110 million of expenses related to a contract renegotiation and UK PPI. The provision for credit losses was up 29% on a linked quarter basis primarily driven by seasonally higher charge offs and the impact of smaller allowance build after an allowance release last quarter. Across all of our business growth drove modest allowance builds in the quarter. Allowance movements across our businesses are detailed in Table 8 of our earnings supplement.","Turning to Slide 4, you can see that reported net interest margin decreased five basis points on a linked quarter basis and seven basis points year-over-year primarily driven by higher rates on interest bearing liabilities and balance sheet mix changes. As we've talked about for some time, we continue to believe that increasing deposit cost will be a headwind to our net interest margin going forward.","Turning to Slide 5, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 11.2%. In the fourth quarter, we purchased 6.9 million common shares for $630 million which completes our 2018 CCAR authorization of $1.2 billion. We continue to view our capital need to be around 11% CET 1 based on current regulations. We believe we have sufficient capital on earnings power to support growth, our Walmart portfolio acquisition the phased in impact of adopting [indiscernible] on January 2020 as well as the potential for a meaningful capital distribution in the 2019 CCAR window.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Fairbank","Thanks, Scott. Before turning to fourth quarter results I'll share a brief update on our Walmart partnership. Walmart is America's largest retailer and we have a shared vision of how a card partnership can be a central part of a winning retail and ecommerce strategy. Last quarter, we announced our agreement to be the exclusive issuer of Walmart co-branded and private label credit cards. Tonight we're announcing that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the existing portfolio of Walmart co-branded and private label credit card receivables at an attractive price and terms.","At closing we expect the portfolio will consist of approximately $9 billion of receivables. And we expect to launch the new originations program and onboard the acquired portfolio late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2019. Since we first announced the new relationship with Walmart, we've consistently said, we'd be happy to acquire the existing portfolio but only at the right price and terms. The portfolio has high credit losses, but we expect that the purchase price and customized revenue and loss sharing agreements will achieve resilient and attractive economics that make this a compelling acquisitions.","For the acquired portfolio our share of credit losses is fixed at a low percentage throughout the partnership. In contrast, our share of revenue steps up after one year, after the step up our share of revenue is about three times our share of credit losses. In our financial results, we will recognize only our net share of the revenues and credit losses. We expect the impact of on boarding the portfolio will be a modest benefit to the charge off rate of our domestic card business.","The new originations program also has revenue and loss sharing terms. The revenue and loss sharing percentages on the new origination program are different than the percentages on the acquired portfolio reflecting the fact that we will drive the underwriting that generates the new originations. In 2019, we expect to incur about $225 million in one-time expenses to launch the new originations programs and integrate the acquired portfolio. These expenses include technology investments and one-time costs associated with hiring and training operational staff and managing the surge of activities related to the conversion and launch. We expect these costs to ramp up over the course of 2019 will break them out as they're incurred throughout the year.","When we onboard the portfolio we expect to build allowance only for our net share of the expected credit losses under the terms of our agreement with Walmart. We currently estimate a day one allowance build of approximately $120 million. The actual allowance build will depend upon the loan balances, credit performance and outlook as of the closing date. Pulling up, we're eager to work with Walmart to leverage payments innovation, digital capabilities and data and analytics to deepen relationships, drive digital adoption and create exceptional customer experience.","We expect that the overall Walmart partnership including the acquired portfolio and the new originations programs and inclusive of the launch and integration cost. We'll have returns and resilience in line with our domestic credit card business. Slide 8 summarizes fourth quarter results for our credit card business. Fourth quarter pre-tax income was down modestly from the prior year as higher non-interest expense was partially offset by revenue growth and lower provision for credit losses.","Looking at the full year we posted strong growth in pre-tax income driven by revenue growth and significant improvement in provision for credit losses. Credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of domestic card business which is shown on Slide 9. In the fourth quarter domestic card ending loan balances were up $2.1 billion or about 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Average loans also grew about 2%, fourth quarter purchase volume increased 11% from the prior year quarter.","Revenue increased 2% from the prior year quarter in line with average loans, revenue margin continues to be relatively stable at 16.0%. Non-interest expense was up about 18% compared to the prior year quarter driven by higher marketing. Our marketing investments are driving strong growth in new accounts and purchase volume. Loan growth is well below new account growth as we remain cautious on credit lines at this point in the cycle. We expect our strength and originations to give us optionality for future loan growth.","Credit trends continue to be a driver of domestic card results in the fourth quarter. The charge off rate for the quarter was 4.64% down 44 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 4.04% up three basis points from the prior year. Credit performance is pretty benign but we should always keep in mind that we're fairly deep in the cycle. Pulling up the competitive market place remains intense but generally rational. Supply of credit card continues to settle out a bit. Against that backdrop our domestic card business continues to gain momentum, we're booking double-digit purchase volume growth, we're seeing traction in digital and product innovation and our investments in marketing are driving strong growth in new accounts.","Slide 10 summarizes fourth quarter results for our consumer banking business which delivered 17% year-over-year increase in pre-tax income in the fourth quarter. Both ending loans and average loans decrease about 21% compared to the prior year quarter driven by the home loans portfolio sale earlier in the year.","Ending loans in our auto business were up 4% year-over-year. Auto originations declined and loan growth decelerated as competitive intensity in auto increased. Ending deposits in the consumer bank were up 7% versus the prior year with a 41 basis points increase in average deposit interest rate compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Our strongest deposit growth is in Capital One 360 Money Market accounts powered by our national banking growth strategy. Rising interest rates, increasing competition and changing product mix have put upward pressure on deposit rates. Looking ahead, we expect further increases in average deposit interest rate as product mix shift continues. We expect increasing competition for deposits will also put upward pressure on deposit rates.","Consumer banking revenue increased about 2% from the fourth quarter of last year. Growth in auto loans and retail deposits was partially offset by the revenue reduction from the home loans portfolio sale. Non-interest expense was flat compared to the prior year quarter. Provision for credit losses was down from the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of strong credit performance in our auto business. The auto charge offs rate improved compared to the prior year quarter and we had a modest allowance build that was smaller than the build in the fourth quarter of 2017. Better than expected auction values continue to support strong auto credit. Over the longer term, we continue to expect that the auto charge off rate will increase gradually as the cycle plays out.","Moving to Slide 11, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. In the fourth quarter pre-tax income was up 12% year-over-year. Fourth quarter ending loan balances were up 9% year-over-year that overstates the underlying growth rate as the timing of pay downs impacted the growth in ending loans. Recalled it last year, we experienced an unusually high level of pay downs just before the year end. The absence of this effect at the end of 2018 moves to the year-over-year growth rate calculation.","Average loans are a better indicator of commercial bank growth trajectory. Growth in average loans was 4% year-over-year. Linked quarter growth was more modest with both ending loans and average loans up about 2%. Commercial bank ending deposits were down 13% from the prior year. Commercial deposit customers continue to rotate out of deposits and into higher yielding investments in the rising interest rate environment. Fourth quarter revenue was down 9% year-over-year primarily driven by the effect of the lower tax rate on tax equivalent yield. Non-interest expense was essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter. Provision for credit losses was significantly lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by lower charge offs. The charge off rate for the quarter was 0.1%.","The Commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 2.6%. The criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.4%. While the credit performance of our commercial banking business remains strong increasing competition from non-banks continues to drive less favorable lending terms in the marketplace. We're keeping a watchful eye on market conditions and staying disciplined in our underwriting and origination choices.","In the fourth quarter Capital One posted solid results as we invest to grow and drive our digital transformation. For full year 2018, we delivered 41% growth in earnings per share net of adjustments. Our domestic card business continues to gain momentum. Growth in new account originations and purchase volumes is very strong. Profitability for the full year is at record levels and we reach an agreement to acquire the Walmart co-branded and private label card portfolio at an attractive price and terms. Our national banking strategy continues to gain traction. And our commercial business continues to deliver solid results.","We continue to drive for operating efficiency as we transform our technology infrastructure and change the way we work. Full year operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments was 45.2% for 2018. From here we expect full year operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to improve modestly in 2019 excluding the one-time Walmart launch and integration expenses. While efficiency ratio can vary in any given year, over the long-term we believe we will be able to achieve continued gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains.","Pulling up, we continue to build an enduringly great franchise with the scale, brand capabilities and infrastructure to succeed as the digital revolution transforms our industry and our society. Our digital and technology transformation is accelerating and it's powering our ability to grow new customer relationships and deepen engagement with new and existing customers. We are well positioned to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create long-term shareholder value.","And now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.","Leanne, please start the Q&A","Operator","[Operator Instructions] and our first question tonight comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","Couple questions on Walmart. I was wondering Scott if you could talk about the impact to the Rev margin I heard your comments on the allowance and then, can you help us better understand $100 million allowance build on $9 billion of loans. Did you buy the loans below par and is there a mark that's unusually high percent? I understand there's also a sharing and that all makes sense. Just trying to drill down a little bit more on that.","Scott Blackley","Yes, thanks Don. Let me just kind of walk through a couple of those questions. So first of all in terms of the allowance build I'll start there. The allowance build is really reflective of the loss share. I'm not going to give you any specifics about the price that we paid in those terms other than to tell you that, we would expect that in the portfolio acquisition accounting that we have to do, that we'll have a minimal amount of intangibles or premiums or discounts and that's going to translate to, no impact on future earnings there.","When shifting to your other questions on revenue margin. You're right that because of the revenue sharing that we have and the fact that we're only going to record the portfolio of the revenue that is attributable to Capital One that will have an impact on revenue margin as we get closer to that transaction we'll give you more details about the impacts of both margin and on our loss rate.","Don Fandetti","Okay and then just to follow-up Scott. It sounds like you're going to make some strategic hires around those portfolio. This is a pretty large transaction I mean do you have critical mass, like is there execution risk for such a large transaction and are you comfortable with that risk.","Scott Blackley","Yes, Don we've been planning for that. We are a card company. This is right in the sweet spot of what we do, so this is really bringing on people into the organization to make sure that we're ready to both integrate the acquired portfolio and also launch the new partnership, so we'll work on that. It's a business that we know well, so while this is a significant undertaking for us to ramp up and get ready. I'm confident that we'll be able to manage that risk.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.","Eric Wasserstrom","Just a couple of questions. The first is, some of the non-interest income lines looked a little bit different than maybe the consensus was expecting. Not so much interchanged but some of the fee lines, was there anything unusual in this quarter's that occurred in with respect to fee income?","Scott Blackley","Yes just a couple of things. So in fee income one, part of the UK PPI is actually a reversal of income that runs through that service charge line item and so that was a component of the quarter-over-quarter decrease. The other components of that are really just a bunch of small individual puts and takes that all kind of went one direction and so I don't think, really are things that you should be concerned about impacting the run rate.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. Thank you. And then just on the auto credit performance and obviously Rich, I just heard your commentary about that. But with respect to the sequential change which showed a bit of deterioration in delinquencies and such, is there anything occurring there beyond the typical seasonal trend that we should be aware of?","Rich Fairbank","No, we don't see anything that would be outside of the norm. I do want to point out, if you look back. You'll see that changes in delinquency rates in the auto business have not been that strongly correlated to changes in credit performance and delinquencies can change for a number of reasons not directly tied to a customer's ability to pay. Such as late fees, call intensities, other servicing strategies just a bunch of things that go on. I will point out though, that the - as we look at the auto industry the ratio of delinquency rates to charge offs has kind of risen overtime and it's just something that we should all keep an eye on and I don't think there is any unusual effect at Capital One, but as we - it's just something that we should all I think keep an eye on, along with things like auction prices which is probably at the top of our list of the factor that has been such a good guy for such a long period of time but of course at some point could go the other way.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Bruce","My first question, I'll start with marketing. You called out that you're going to increase spending significantly in the fourth quarter and you did. I guess when we look at the significant year-over-year investment could you maybe elaborate as to what you're expecting to get for that increase in marketing, is this purely accounts or would you expect the transaction volume to increase from where it is currently?","Rich Fairbank","So in marketing, first of all let me just kind of pull way up, marketing rose a lot $327 million quarter-over-quarter which is higher than typical seasonal increases as we continue to see strong opportunities for card originations, we launched a new card product and we rolled out our National Bank marketing. So one thing let me just, let me turn to the bank because I know your question is a card one, but part of the marketing number is on the bank side, so let me just start there. Every bank needs to figure out how to fund their company as they grow many kind of if you pull way back to it via acquisitions, as you know ours is an organic strategy that capitalizes on our strength and we've heard for years kind of been taking our two banks that we have one direct bank and one local bank and basically building one integrated bank which is integration across technology, product, the customer experience. There is a lot that goes into that and we've sort of spent years doing it. So what's noteworthy about this year and a milestone for us is, that we reached the stage of sort of integration of these businesses that we're able to launch national marketing of our very digitally leaning bank and so that's and that's a strategy that we will continue at Capital One. It just happened to be launched in the latter part of this year.","Now a significant part of the increase in marketing was on the card side and we on the card side, if you - think a little bit about spenders and revolvers, on the spender side and of course quite a bit of our marketing is directly oriented at heavy spenders. We have for years been building a heavy spend business that it's all about good products, the customer experience and brand and we have seen increasing traction in that business and the ability to originate very compelling accounts that have wonderful enduring, long-term low risk annuities. And so we see a lot of traction there and we capitalize on this window that we see with respect to that business and you can see the purchase volume growth, the interchanged growth and noteworthy. This is achieved at stable margin and in that part of that business all at the same time, we're having rising returns. So that is very much happening just as we speak. The sort of delayed gratification part of the conversation is more on the revolver side, where again how the economics of that business works it's really driven by balances. Balances are driven by the choice on credit line.","We see a very good opportunity and great traction in terms of originating accounts, but we continue to be cautious at this part of the cycle with respect to the extension of credit line and so in that sense it is little bit more about building option value. But the thing I want to stress, the way to build long-term growth in a business like this is, you got to do with accounts one can't just endlessly give credit line increases to one's own customers and so this phase for us is very much on the revolver side about building accounts and we're storing up some value, some option value relative to loan growth as the opportunity presents itself. But the key thing is, the accounts don't wait for us, so we want to capitalize on that when we can, while it's not. I don't want to overstate the point, that in a sense the credit opportunity is something where we can more chose the timing and so pulling way up, as I kind I've been indicating in the last couple of quarters we see a very nice opportunity in the card business and we wanted to step in and capitalize on that.","Ken Bruce","Okay well understand. Thanks for the detail on that. Just a clarifying point, in terms of the $9 billion that you're acquiring from Walmart and congratulations on getting that signed. Is that going to be the entire existing portfolio or is that - just run off somewhere where I think it was close to $10 billion last [indiscernible] reported on it, so are there current carve outs or is that the whole thing and you're just going to deal with the pricing and the loan loss sharing just in terms of dealing with the poor performers.","Rich Fairbank","Yes, Ken that represents our estimate of the accounts that are still going to be in place when we get to the purchase date out at the end of Q3, early Q4 of next year and I would expect as we do a normal acquisitions that we would acquire current accounts as well as then delinquent accounts.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Can you hear me?","Rich Fairbank","Yes.","Betsy Graseck","Couple of questions. Just one on the Walmart portfolio how do you think about managing that book from here and is there anything you can share with us with regard to expectations for growth or credit quality or cross sell if you could give us a sense as to what your plans are for that going forward? Thank you.","Rich Fairbank","Betsy, I don't think we have any unique things to say about how we would grow that book. The key thing about a partnership like this is to have a successful program we're going to need attractive products that both organization work hard to market effectively, a great customer experience and really great underwriting and we have a spent a lot of time with Walmart sort of thinking about how we can leverage their amazing size, and scale, and leadership and access to customers along with our position as a technology leader within the financial services marketplace and our underwriting and some of the combined marketing skills that we both have. So but right now that's kind of more on the drawing board and we're excited about the opportunity but a lot of it will boil down to execution.","Betsy Graseck","Okay and then just to follow up, it has to do with. Just expenses in run rate business. I'm wondering if you could comment a little bit around professional fees. It looked like that might have been up a little bit in the quarter and maybe you could give us some census to whether or not that's something that's likely to persist here or was there some unique activity in 4Q that drove that off.","Rich Fairbank","Yes, Betsy. Let me walk through that so, if you look at total non-interest expense that was up, as I talked about my talking points on a year-over-year basis principally driven by marketing. If I exclude marketing and just get to operating expenses there we saw a pretty modest increase of about 1% year-over-year, on a linked quarter basis. The thing to remember is that, last quarter in Q3 we had $170 million legal build so if I backed that out of Q3 I had about $200 million increase in operating expenses. Now let me break out kind of how that happened. About $110 million as I mentioned in my talking points where one-time expenses that were related either to a contract renegotiation or UK PPI and then the remainder is normal seasonal ramp that we see this time of year as we do things like engage professional service providers to help us prepare for CCAR real personal example, but also to do other things in the business. That's kind of a normal season's pattern for us. So once you take out those one-time things, I think that gets you to what you would normally expect to see in Q4.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Just want to follow-up on the Walmart questions. I guess when we think about EPS growth next year, how should we think about one, obviously investments you have to make with Walmart, do we exclude those for the purposes of thinking of EPS growth and then secondly, is the marketing expense run rate given you guys had a pretty elevated run rate today and then, maybe also just on capital return. Scott you mentioned you guys can return a decent amount of capital I just want to understand the capital required for the portfolio acquisition. Thanks.","Scott Blackley","Yes, why don't I start in terms of the capital and then I'll turn it back over to Rich. So on the capital the acquisition of the acquired portfolio is going to cost us roughly 30 basis points of capital and because we've already completed our CCAR authorization for 2018 over the next several quarters we're already 11.2% [ph] finishing 2018. For the next two quarters we don't have an opportunity to do any capital distributions beyond our normal dividend. So we're likely to accrete capital that puts us in an excellent position to fund that the acquisition of portfolio what the existing capital and then, be ready to adopt CECL at the end of the year, so that's a little bit of the capital trajectory and as I think about the opportunity for capital distribution as I mentioned we're starting at 11.2% [ph] we're going to be accreting. I think we've got their earnings capacity to absorb the organic growth that we see fund the Walmart transaction, get ready for CECL and still have the potential for a meaningful capital distribution.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And then on the EPS growth.","Scott Blackley","Rich, do you want to jump into the other questions?","Rich Fairbank","Well, sorry so on marketing, was that a Walmart marketing question or overall?","Sanjay Sakhrani","Overall. How we used to think about EPS growth, you guys obviously had a great year this year, but how should we think about forward.","Rich Fairbank","So on the marketing side, we will - I think most importantly the levels of future marketing are going to be based on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace. The bank marketing I referred to that's going to be less opportunistic one quarter to the next, that's just more of the way that we're going to build our really fund the company and build our national banking business. But so we're going to continue to invest in marketing and brand but it will still be a call to see the opportunity in the marketplace when we get there. So I think we continue to be very bullish about the opportunity at Capital One in creating value this year was a very strong year of earnings growth, we're not giving specific EPS guidance next year, but I think we continue to be very bullish about the business and the opportunity that is growing and the - as we look down the road, the opportunity to overtime get the benefits to the Walmart portfolio where you can see that it's really in the third year from now, where we really get up to the full run rate of that, the benefits as we get there of getting to some very key milestones on the tech transformation side, so these are all things that you know align our future. And for well both of those specifically there are certain investments that are going on right now in pursuit of that, but I think the opportunity that we see down the road is very attractive particularly.","Scott Blackley","And Sanjay just to come back to your questions on the one-time cost that we talked about Walmart. I certainly believe that those were costs that aren't indicative of the run rate of the business and the company's ability to deliver efficiency that's the reason that we've called those out and that will continue to isolate those for you next year.","Jeff Norris","Next question please. And we'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Can you give us any sense as to the assumption for revenue growth and the target for an efficiency ratio that is kind of shows modest improvement I guess given the very, very significant amounts that you had in this second half of 2018 and how that would be reflective, if you had somewhat worse revenue performance and I do have a follow-up.","Rich Fairbank","Moshe, we don't have a specific disclosure about revenue growth. I've kind of I think laid out some of the elements that are creating an opportunity particularly for revenue growth overtime obviously the stored value with respect to for to the very strong account originations right now and the stepwise good guy that's going to come from Walmart those are particularly two revenue pieces that are been in the delayed gratification category.","Moshe Orenbuch","So it would generally be I guess it will be nice to see a little more matching of that, a little more matching of that spending with that, with the returns from that. But I guess to maybe from a philosophical standpoint when you think about the Walmart portfolio are their objectives and yours primarily to provide credit to those customers, is it a transaction vehicle for online spending? Is it a co-brand type of arrangement? Like how do you think about the way you're going to be executing on that program in terms of the front book and the new accounts you're soliciting.","Rich Fairbank","Moshe that's a very good question. Right now the Walmart portfolio is one that is pretty revolver oriented. It's got high credit losses and I think that we and Walmart have aspiration to build a pretty different business. In the first word, I would put out there is the word digital. So to have this partnership be right at the vortex of the growth opportunity that Walmart is putting at the top of their entire strategic priority transforming themselves not only technologically but particularly to be a really big player, in the online retailing space and the partnership is certainly, we have that at the top of the list on this. So technology is going to be incredibly important driving digital activation and activity and there's I think quite a bit of market aspiration and if you look actually at Walmart's customer base there is a lot of that market - people there and a lot of opportunity. Now the key is to turn that opportunity into real digital buying power and that's what Walmart is focused on and I think we're going to be there to help on that, along in the way credit is also a very important thing obviously and I think that our experience from the very top pretty much across the credit spectrum I think is one thing that was in appeal on the Walmart side for having us as a partner, but that will be very critical part of that as well, but it is certainly our hope to pivot the sort of center of gravity of this partnership and expand the opportunity and move it more up market.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Brendler with Buckingham Research Group.","Chris Brendler","Another question in the card business, but not about Walmart. I understand there's a lot of good signs and then results of this evening with the strong purchase volume growth and making sense your optimism about the account growth, but I thought we're going to see a little better loan growth as we head into fourth quarter and [indiscernible] stuck at 2% doesn't feel like a Capital One type number because given although you're reporting to marketing what feels to be a good spot competitively, it can be outside perspective. So how do you feel about loan growth and maybe just your conservatism online granting at this point, as you're holding that back and also does the fact the CARD Act made it difficult to change rates on the fly sort of limiting your ability to extend balance growth at the point. Thanks.","Rich Fairbank","Chris, sorry. What was your CARD Act question one more time?","Chris Brendler","Just the fact that you can't change rates, [indiscernible] delinquents the protection we had last recession where you could raise rates across the board and maybe that's sort of limiting your ability to get a little more aggressive online granting just given we're around the cycle.","Rich Fairbank","Let me go back to start with Moshe's very hard felt [indiscernible]. It would be nice to see more matching of spending and return way. Isn't that the, that would be my wish for this business and in fact over the years the matching has become even more not align as with FAS 166\/167 the mass of allowance builds, growth mass a lot of things in this business get pretty disaligned now a lot of it is inherent in the actual mechanics of how accounting and the business works. This particular alignment we're talking about here is, now some of it is inherent in the sense that whenever one spends a lot of money on marketing to generate accounts, accounts don't make any money. So the only things that bring instant revenue are going to create that alignment and things like big balance transfers. It's really basically things that bring a lot of balances in, that's what creates that alignment.","One of things we've done overtime it's funny I haven't dusted off this phrase for a couple of years now, but you will remember Chris for years we were saying, we were running down high balance revolvers and we've continued to, now we're more in equilibrium with respect to that, but there are a lot of things that in the good times make a lot of money and I put high balance revolvers at the top, number one on that list. The issue is the resilience of that particular segment. So we just ask because of who we are at Capital One we've focused tremendously on resilience and we over the years have really driven down the proportion of our book that's high balance revolvers, now the - and to the specific issue today it's a pretty much $0.01 answer as to why the account growth and the loan growth are not connected and that is our choice on credit line.","And while the CARD Act makes probably the stakes, not probably the CARD Act makes the stakes even higher to make sure that one's underwriting decisions are right the first time. We believe, we spend a lot of our energy looking at the competitive marketplace, looking at the credit cycle and then trying to make our choices accordingly and a lot of times we zig, while others zag and it's not an accident, it's actually a causal relationship because a lot of where opportunity lies and where risk exists is the flipside of what competitors are doing. So on this particular case and I really want to stress, we're capitalizing on the opportunities the marketplace presents and the success that we're seeing in our individual programs in the card business, to lean into that and capitalize on the growth opportunity.","While our credit numbers are great and you can see the same numbers that we see, we're deep into the credit cycle and nobody knows when this thing is going to turn, but we believe that the prudent thing to do is have our foot on the gas of account originations and our foot a little bit on the break with respect to credit line extension. But it just turns out that method of driving if you will creates a really asymmetrical timing in numbers and cause a bunch of people to scratch their heads and wonder what we're doing, all I can say is that's probably a manifestation of the way we think and way we have thought over all these years. This particular disconnect of break and accelerator is among the highest examples of that, that I can remember in our history.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rich Shane with JP Morgan.","Rich Shane","I just want to circle back on marketing. It was running for the first three quarters of the year up 11% or 12%. Fourth quarter it was up 80% year-over-year. I'm just curios if you can help us with some sort of guidance and what the cadence should be through 2019 and just as my follow-up, how quickly do you dial this up and dial this back?","Rich Fairbank","So there's three different things that were going on that all came together in this particular quarter. There are really four things that came together in this kind of record quarter of marketing, one is seasonality that is seasonally very high anyway and we should always keep that in mind. We've talked about the national banking that's more of - that's not going to be an episodic line of scrimmage thing that's more of just, what we're going to do to build the business. On the card side, we also had in the fourth quarter the launch of one of our products. [Technical difficulty].","Jeff Norris","Is the call still active?","Operator","Yes, you're still live.","Jeff Norris","So we need the next question please.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","I had a two part one. First do you guys have a sense for Walmart's commitment to promoting the new Walmart Capital One store card both on its website and in its stores and then secondly, do you think Walmart's commitment to promoting the new credit card is necessary to prevent the pool of applicants from skewing to a higher risk level. The reason I asked is because we've heard that Walmart's philosophy going back to towning has been not to promote credit to its customers and the result over the years was that, those who applied for credit with Walmart tended to be riskier credit seeking customers and I just want to hear your thoughts on those two questions?","Rich Fairbank","Bill, I think you're going to mostly have to find that answer and let me Walmart speak for themselves on that. Let me say though I want to absolutely echo one of the comments that you made. Their commitment is absolutely necessary for this deal to be successful and it was an important consideration for us, as we entertained doing this partnership. So I think we've been impressed with Walmart's intent relative to this thing. This is going to be all about execution and I think third parties are committed to making this thing be very successful.","Bill Carcache","Appreciate that. Thanks for the comments Rich.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Just looking Q3 to Q4 the yield on the loan book was pretty flat, it had various components of liabilities also modest increase in cost. Number one, is there anything seasonal to think about there. And number two, given those trends and your comments on kind of pressures on deposit costs, what do we think about NIM over the near term next one, two, three quarters.","Scott Blackley","Thanks for the question, John. On net interest margin let me just kind of walk through some things that I think you might want to think about, so one just to remind you that NIM does tend to very seasonally and you'll see that quarter-to-quarter factors like seasonality and day count can make NIM up and down across each of those quarters. Looking forward we do think that, we've talked about deposits cost is being one aspect that could up, pressure on NIM and be a headwind. There's always puts and takes though in net interest margin, balance sheet mix is always a factor depending on the pace of growth of the different asset classes that can actually be a tailwind for NIM. And I would say just in terms of rates as we've told folks for a while now we are fairly neutral to implied forwards. So I don't expect that there is much risk that would benefit for us in terms of where rates can go from here and then finally I would just say like most banks a steeper yield curve would be favorable for the net interest margin, that fit gives you a little bit of the sense of where I could see that going.","Jeff Norris","Next question please. I'm sorry John, did you had a follow-up?","John Hecht","I was going to ask, is there anything specific to call out in Q4? You did mention some seasonal factors but was there anything in Q4 specifically?","Scott Blackley","No.","John Hecht","Got it. Thanks very much.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari","Regarding the loss share on new originations. I know you mentioned different terms than the loss share that you agreed upon on the back book. How should we think about the assumed loss experience on new originations and how that should impact your what shows up on your, hits your P&L? Could that loss ratio come in above 4.5% level where you're operating at legacy Capital One or and could it near the 10% back book for legacy Walmart? Thanks.","Scott Blackley","So, well first of all we we're hopeful of being able to generate a book overall with credit losses that are in a different place than where the current book is. But because of the loss share whatever that loss number is, our loss number that we will experience will be fair amount lower than that because of the loss share so I think the overall front book and back book the overall Walmart portfolio is going to be very likely to be a positive contributor. I mean to the charge off of the company.","John Pancari","Okay and then separately the loss share and revenue share terms, does that, does that last for the life of the acquired loans and as well as the duration of new originations.","Scott Blackley","Yes these loss sharing percentages are for the life of this deal. We have one set of percentages for the back book and the only little wrinkle there is, the revenue share goes up to its destination in the second year and remains there for the life of the agreement, the loss share is throughout the same, is where it is for the whole partnership. On the front book, right out of the blocks we'll have a specific loss share and a specific revenue share that remained for the entirety of the partnership."],"4126":["Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 18, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Jeff Norris","Richard D.

After a decade of great work at our company, this is Gary's last earnings call.","Now at Capital One, as you know, we always search the world to find the very best talent. And that's how we found Gary. I tried to get Gary to join us in 1994. He chose other options, but we didn't give up and he finally saw the light in 2003. And since then, Gary has made a huge impact to Capital One on every step of our journey to build a great company and reward our investors. He's been a strong leader and a wise and trusted advisor. And as you know he's smart, he's rigorous, and he has the highest of integrity. I know you will join me in saying thanks to Gary and wishing him the best as he immerses himself in his many interests beyond Capital One. I'm grateful for everything he's done to put our company in a strong position.","As we wish Gary well, we're also welcoming Steve Crawford to our company as our new CFO. Steve will officially take over the CFO role on May 24 and you'll be hearing from him during our second quarter earnings call. Steve brings more than 2 decades of big-time financial services experience to the table, including having been the CFO of Morgan Stanley, and he knows our company well. Steve has already hit the ground running since joining us in February and he's fully engaged in having an important impact on how we continue to win in the marketplace, how we manage our business and get our investors paid. Gary and Steve have been exemplary in working together to ensure a smooth transition and I'm looking forward to working with Steve for many years to come.","And now, with my deep appreciation for all he's done over the last decade and for one last time, I'll turn the call over to Gary.","Gary L. Perlin","Thanks, Rich, for those very generous comments. It's been a personal and professional privilege to work with you and the entire Capital One team for 10 very exciting years. I also count, as a highlight, the opportunity to meet and interact regularly with so many analysts and shareholders. You all have both challenged and supported me and I hope that I have returned the favor in the spirit of friendship and mutual respect.","Now as always, let's get down to business. We'll turn to Slide 3. Capital One earned just over $1 billion or $1.79 per share in the first quarter, including $2.5 billion of pre-provision earnings, which, if we're adjusting for the benefit of moving our Best Buy partnership portfolio to held for sale, is about in line with the quarterly run rate we anticipated for 2013. In addition, earnings in the quarter benefited from lower provision expense, which was driven by a $261 million allowance release. Lastly, we recognized a $97 million charge for rep and warranty expense in the quarter, which was driven by a $107 million charge in discontinued operations, offset by a slight benefit in continuing operations.","There were also a few notable events in the quarter. First, we redeemed $3.6 billion of high-coupon, trust-preferred securities on January 2, which had a benefit to net revenue this quarter of $9 million. This includes a $75 million benefit to interest expense, partially offset by a onetime, non-interest income reduction of $65 million attributable to the accelerated amortization of issuance costs.","Second, we announced our agreement to sell the Best Buy partnership portfolio and moved about $7 billion of loans to held for sale as of February 1. This movement to held for sale resulted in a $40 million benefit to revenue in the quarter and a $41 million reduction in provision expense. The provision benefit results from the fact that expected charge-offs are absorbed by the carrying value of the held-for-sale loans after reclassifying some $289 million in loan loss allowance. Revenue similarly benefits as reversals of fee and finance charges are also taken against the carrying value of the loans, although the movement of loans to held for sale resulted in an $87 million benefit to income before tax in the quarter.","We expect earnings will be positively impacted for the first 3 quarters of this year until the partnership portfolio sale closes. This positive impact on 2013 earnings will be partially offset by the reduction in earnings once the sale closes late in the third quarter. We have included an appendix slide in this presentation detailing expected quarterly financial statement impacts by line item. These estimates are limited to 2013 and do not necessarily reflect opportunity costs in 2014 and beyond. That's because we expect to capture incremental cost savings going forward and because revenues would likely have fallen as a result of our choices around card practices, such as exiting payment protection.","Turning to Slide 4. I'll briefly discuss highlights of our first quarter income statement. Pre-provision earnings were up 7% in the quarter or 5% net of the benefit from moving the Best Buy partnership to held for sale. This improvement was driven by a decrease in non-interest expense, partially offset by the expected seasonal decline in revenue. Revenue was down from the fourth quarter as seasonally lower balances and purchase volume in our Domestic Card business were partially offset by higher margins, which I'll discuss shortly.","Non-interest expense decreased 7% from the fourth quarter. The operating and marketing expense levels tend to be seasonally high. The quarterly impact on operating expense from the amortization of purchased intangibles and integration costs are detailed on this slide and expected annual impacts, which really haven't changed in our estimate, are shown on Slide 12 in the appendix. At this point, non-interest expense is currently tracking a bit below our projected run rate for 2013, which I shared with you on last quarter's call, which we'll have more to say on expenses in a few moments.","Putting these items together, please recall that our January estimates for revenue and expenses for 2013 were approximately $22.5 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively, resulting in pre-provision earnings of about $10 billion. 3 months into the year, those estimates for the full-year remain within any reasonable margin of error.","We saw a 23% decline in provision expense in the quarter, primarily driven by a $261 million allowance release, partially offset by $67 million in other provision expense. The other expense was driven by a reserve build for unfunded commercial commitments, reflecting a one time change in estimate and by foreign currency adjustments. The largest component of the allowance release was in Domestic Card, with a better-than-anticipated credit performance in the quarter, including delinquencies, and an improvement in drivers for our future outlook. Still, the coverage ratio of allowance to delinquencies in Domestic Card rose above the level in recent quarters.","Finally, we recorded a $97 million charge in rep and warranty in the quarter, of which $107 million was recorded in discontinued operations, offset by a $10 million release in continuing operations. This expense reflects our assessment of probable and estimable losses in light of the current environment, largely in relation to non-agency mortgage developments.","Turning now to Slide 5. I'll touch briefly on loan balances and margins. Average interest-earning assets fell in the quarter as a result of both lower cash balances and a seasonal reduction in loan balances. The decrease in loan balances was offset by net interest margin expansion. Reported NIM increased in the first quarter to 6.71% from 6.52% in the fourth quarter. Two factors drove the quarterly increase in NIM, offsetting the reduction resulting from the simple math of the first quarter having 2 fewer days' worth of recognized income. The first positive impact was from the redemption of trust-preferred securities early in the quarter. This resulted in an 11-basis-point benefit to interest expense as well as an 8-basis-point benefit from reducing the cash balances that had been built up in anticipation of the call of those securities. It's also a 7-basis-point improvement from the $40 million revenue benefit from the announced sale of the partnership portfolio. Although those loans are now accounted for as held for sale, the balances remain as interest-earning assets.","Looking forward, we continue to expect about $12 billion in loan runoff in 2013, about $10 billion in mortgage runoff and about $2 billion in Domestic Card. Planned runoff will continue in 2014, which we estimate at about $8.5 billion, of which $7.5 billion is in mortgage and $1 billion in card. As for NIM, we continue to expect that we'll experience some cross-currents. Like the rest of the industry, low interest rates and relatively flat yield curve and weak loan demand represent headwinds. However, we expect to see the continued beneficial effect of lower rates in deposits and other borrowings and a rotation from lower-yielding mortgages to a broader mix of consumer and commercial loans.","Turning to Slide 6, our Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel I basis was about 80 basis points in the quarter to end at 11.8%. We expect that we will continue to generate substantial amounts of capital in coming quarters, inclusive of our previously announced intention to increase the quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share beginning this quarter, subject to final approval of our Board of Directors at its scheduled meeting in May. As noted on our last call, we have formally begun our journey to adopt Basel II, also referred to as advanced approaches, which, for Capital One, will take effect on or after January 1, 2016. Using our evolving estimates of this impact, Capital One's Tier 1 common ratio, under currently proposed rules for implementing Basel III over coming years, will be about 8.5%. This estimate incorporates the amortization of PCCR and the scheduled pay down of capital punitive investment securities. Let me remind you that this ratio is now above our assumed target when Basel III is fully phased in over the next several years.","Rich will address in his comments our intentions for capital management in light of our strong balance sheet position and expected generation of substantial amounts of additional capital going forward.","With that, let me hand the call back to Rich.","Richard D. Fairbank","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 7, which provides an overview of solid business results in the first quarter. Our Domestic Card business posted strong profitability in the quarter. As Gary already discussed, first quarter results reflect the impacts of the planned Best Buy portfolio sale and held-for-sale accounting. Excluding held-for-sale accounting impacts, ending loan volumes declined 7.4% in the quarter, which compares to quarterly declines of about 6% in the first quarters of 2012 and 2011. Expected seasonal patterns and planned runoff of some of the acquired HSBC-branded loans drove the first quarter decline. Purchase volume, excluding HSBC, increased about 5.5% compared to the first quarter of 2012. First quarter last year had 2 more processing days than the first quarter this year. Adjusting for the difference in day count, the year-over-year growth in purchase volume would've been about 8%.","Domestic Card revenue margin, excluding held-for-sale accounting impacts, was about 16.3% in line with normal seasonal patterns. Charge-off rate increased 8 basis points in the quarter to 4.4%. Delinquency rate improved 24 basis points to 3.4%. Charge-off and delinquency trends were both modestly better than expected seasonal patterns. As we've discussed for several quarters, we believe that cautious consumer behavior is one of the key drivers of persistently weak consumer demand and the resulting pressure on loan growth. However, the flip side of relatively weak loan volumes is relatively strong credit performance, which we've observed over the last couple of years.","The Consumer Banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans declined about $1.5 billion, in line with our expectations. About $800 million of continuing growth in Auto Loans was more than offset by about $2.2 billion of expected mortgage runoff. Auto Loan originations were down $500 million compared to the first quarter of last year, a decline of about 11%. The year-over-year decline in originations reflect increased competition and our choice not to chase growth that might compromise the sustained returns or resilience of the business.","Consumer Banking revenue was stable compared to the fourth quarter. Loan yields were stable and deposit interest expense improved modestly. Provision expense was relatively stable. The Auto Finance charge-off rate showed modest seasonal improvement and the overall Consumer Banking charge-off rate remains below 1%.","Our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of solid growth and profitability. Loans grew 1% in the quarter and 12% year-over-year. Revenues were up about 4% compared to the first quarter of last year, driven by growth in loans and deposit balances. Revenues grew despite increased competition and pressure on margin. Our loan yield was down 56 basis points from the first quarter in 2012, which is largely due to the continuing impact of the low rate environment, movement of our portfolio to more floating rate loans with better credit and the absence of a favorable onetime impact we had in the first quarter of 2012.","Non-interest expense improved about 12% in the quarter, driven by the absence of several non-recurring items from the fourth quarter of 2012. Quarterly operating expense was down about 1% compared to the first quarter of last year. Our charge-off rate in the quarter was 7 basis points. We continue to see improvements in non-performing loans and credit-sized loans, so we expect a strong credit performance of our Commercial Banking business to continue.","Turning to Slide 8. Let me pull up and talk about how our businesses are positioned. Our Commercial Banking business is in a strong position to continue to deliver steady growth and profitability. While increasing competition, particularly in middle-market lending, may continue to impact the pricing of new loan originations. We have a diverse set of businesses in attractive markets. For example, our focus on strong local market, commercial real estate and our deep industry verticals and C&I lending continue to drive solid growth and profitability. Across our Commercial Banking businesses, loan growth, credit and profitability trends remain healthy.","In Consumer Banking, both our direct bank and branch-based deposit franchises remain very well positioned. We continue to see the benefits of local scale and attractive markets and we've made great strides in operational and customer improvement in our branch franchise. On February 1, we rebranded ING Direct to our new direct banking brand, Capital One 360. Rebranding efforts and customer communications are going well. Capital One 360 is now the leading digital bank positioned at the forefront of where banking is going. Our home loans credit trends remain strong and meaningfully better than the assumptions we incorporated into credit marks on the acquired Home Loans portfolios. And our servicing operations are solid.","In our Auto Finance business, our focus on building deep relationships with our most-valued auto dealers continues to pay off. We're delivering surefooted growth by expanding this relationship approach to new geographies. We still see solid overall profitability and above-hurdle returns in new originations, but we expect that increased competition will drive returns from our current levels closer towards cycle average. We expect that our Auto Finance business will continue to deliver solid growth and returns.","Our Domestic Card business is very healthy and delivering attractive results. Margins and returns are strong, even as we invest in franchise enhancements. Charge-off and delinquencies are normalizing at strong levels with the expected seasonal patterns. And it's important to note that reported results in our Domestic Card business are inclusive of our partnerships business, which has lower margins, average charge-off rates and lower returns compared to our branded Card business. The key issue is loan growth, which reflects both some weak demand and, just as importantly, the strategic choices we're making. We are choosing to let the least-resilient loans we acquired from HSBC runoff. We're also continuing to emphasize resilience in our new originations, as we remain largely on the sidelines of the high-balance revolver space in the Domestic Card market. This choice to avoid high-balance revolvers swamps the other factors that impact loan growth, because this part of the market presents the greatest opportunity to grow loan balances through the use of balance transfer teasers and through balanced stimulation offers to existing customers. For years, we've talked about the resilience issues with high-balance revolvers and we've consistently chosen to avoid this part of the market. By definition, the value and benefit of resilience is harder to see during the good times. But our choice to largely stay out of this part of the market was one of the key drivers of our relatively strong performance through The Great Recession.","We continue to actively pursue revolver customers that have lower balances and indebtedness levels, as well as transactor customers where we are gaining share. While the transactor business does not deliver near-term loan growth, it does deliver attractive and sustained economic value through high-spending and interchange revenue, low attrition, low credit losses and franchise-enhancing customer relationships.","Our choices are evident in selected Domestic Card metrics. Loan volumes reflect both significant planned runoff and our choice to stay out of the high-balance revolver space. The fact that only 6% of our Domestic Card loan balances are on promotional rates is another result of avoiding high-balance revolvers. Purchase volume growth reflects the continuing growth of transactor customer relationships. And over time, we expect the runoff will subside and that the gains we are seeing in the customer segments we're focused on will more clearly drive loan growth.","Our Domestic Card business is delivering significant shareholder value today in the form of strong and sustainable returns and capital generation.","I'll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 8. Our businesses continued to deliver solid results in the quarter. We have great businesses with attractive and resilient risk-adjusted returns, led by strong and sustainable profitability of our Domestic Card business. Our Auto Finance and Commercial Banking businesses are delivering solid growth. Our balance sheet is strong and we continue to generate significant capital.","In the near term, we continue to navigate the challenges of the prolonged low interest rate environment, weak consumer demand and significant planned runoff of certain acquired mortgage and card loans. We are not content to simply watch these market challenges and runoff trends play out. We are fully mobilized to protect the profitability and returns of our business by managing costs and to deliver shareholder value by returning capital. I'll discuss cost management first.","Our outlook for non-interest expense in 2013 remain $12.5 billion, comprised of $11 billion in operating expense and $1.5 billion in marketing expense. In 2014, we expect operating expense to improve to about $10.4 billion. We expect acquisition-related intangible amortization to decline by about $100 million compared to 2013. While this is a non-cash item that amortizes away, we intend to manage our businesses to ensure that the savings hit the bottom line. We'll also manage down our integration cost by about $160 million versus 2013 and intend to manage so that these cash savings hit the bottom line as well. We expect to realize the remaining operating expense improvements through our continuing efforts to manage expenses tightly and operate more efficiently across our businesses. Our operating expense outlook does not include the potential impacts of either positive or negative non-recurring items, which we do not forecast.","As always, we will make decisions about how and when to spend marketing dollars based on our current and expected view of opportunities in the marketplace.","Moving now to capital. As Gary discussed, we're in a strong capital position today and we continue to generate capital on a strong trajectory. With the successful completion of the 2013 CCAR process in March, we're planning to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share beginning in May, subject to approval by our board. As we've discussed, we see this as the first step. Based on our current forecast and subject to regulatory approval, we would expect to request share repurchases that would drive 2014 total payout ratio to a level well above current bank industry norms, driven by several factors. We expect that our business will continue to generate attractive returns, adding to our existing capital strength. We expect significant planned runoff to continue through 2014 and we believe purchase account -- excuse me, purchasing our own stock is a particularly compelling alternative at the current time.","We've started discussions with our regulators to seek approval to begin share repurchases in 2013. While we have not yet reached agreement for this -- while we have not yet reached agreement for the sale of the Best Buy portfolio at the time of our CCAR submission in early January, our CCAR plan indicated that, in the event we reach an agreement to sell the assets, we would seek approval to distribute capital freed up by such a sale. Any said share repurchases would be subject to approval by our regulators and, if approved, would not be executed until the time the portfolio sale actually closes.","Pulling up, our outlook for the next couple of years implies that diligent expense management and significant capital return will be key levers to create shareholder value. And we are highly focused on delivering that value as quickly and effectively as possible.","And now, Gary and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] If you have any follow-ups after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Matt, please start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And we'll take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the comments on CCAR. You talked about that the plan contemplated the -- you being able to go back and repurchase some stock that was freed up. Can you give us a sense of what that incorporates? So is it you're allowed to repurchase stock of the capital that was actually freed up from the transaction? Or is there a different amount? And second, just when you say total payout way above banking industry norms, can you kind of try to quantify that or, at least, put it in a range for us?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, Ryan, first of all, when we -- there's not an official kind of CCAR process that we are reentering here. So our intent is consistency with what was in our original CCAR process or application, if you will. And that was very explicit about this Best Buy component. So what we are trying to free up is the capital associated with the Best Buy sale. But again, what actually happens along the way in these conversations is something that there's not an official process and we'll have to see what happens in the Fed conversation. With respect to what we mean by the payout above sort of industry norms, bank industry norms, well, as we look out there, I think the bank industry norms are running kind of around 50% in terms of total payout ratio. And our intent for 2014 is to distribute well above that.","Operator","We go next to Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So quickly, if the buyback -- if you were to get new approval for the buyback, the earliest we could hope for is basically fourth quarter as you expect the sale to close in the third, correct? And secondly, you discussed loan growth being still the big challenge out there. Can you discuss what you're seeing from competitors, especially in the card industry, that could be limiting that availability?","Gary L. Perlin","Yes. Craig, it's Gary. I'll take your first question. And again, as Rich said, there's not a formal process. But just following our own capital plan, we would wait until after the sale closes and the capital is freed up to begin any repurchases that are approved by the regulators. So that would be probably end of the third quarter, early fourth, yes.","Richard D. Fairbank","Craig, in terms of the competition, I assume we're talking about, in the Card business -- I think competition in the Card business is at a -- I mean, it's always intense. But it's at a fairly stable and reasonably rational level. The biggest issue, I mean, I think we should start with this just sort of demand itself industry -- I mean, revolving debt is generally going sideways. It's been going sideways for an extended period of time. Certainly, purchase volume in the industry is -- I mean, the card industry, since it's kind of bottomed at the downturn, the card industry has seen their own purchase volume grow faster than retail sales in the same way that the reverse effect happened on the way down. So I mean, that's been a pretty good thing. And I think the industry has settled out to a place where supply is down from where it went to in 2011. I think what happened is, as competitors saw the sun just start to peek out a little bit in -- with respect to the great recession, they stepped on the gas with respect to direct mail volumes and marketing in 2011 and, I think, found that there wasn't nearly kind of the response that they had hoped for. So what has happened is direct mail volumes are now kind of like 30% down from there. Generally stable. Pricing out there in the marketplace is generally stable, I think, going up just a little bit. And so I don't think our opportunities are really being driven by competitor actions. I think they're really being driven by the choice that we make in the -- sort of again, if we denominate our conversation by loan growth and really the choice is about the high-balance revolvers and the balance transfer sort of teaser rate gain, that is the thing that sort of most dominates the metrics with respect to loan growth. But if I look beyond that, yes, demand is weak. We are gaining share in all the segments that we are investing in. I think we very much like the economics of what we're booking. And the -- we don't want to push anything in an unnatural way. But the key thing is we're saying we want to make sure that our -- that we can maintain the exceptionally high returns we have in the Card business. And we got to do that through managing our expenses carefully. Redoubling that imperative, of course, is having Best Buy move out of the equation. So there's tremendous energy on the expense side in the Card business and then across the company on both expenses and in terms of capital return.","Operator","We'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I had one question specifically to Best Buy and then one for Rich. Just on Best Buy, I was looking at that table that you guys had in the slide deck towards the end of it. And I was wondering, is the fourth quarter the number to kind of look at and annualize? And when I do annualize that number, it kind of approximates about $0.38 in EPS after tax. I was just wondering whether in that fourth quarter number, there's some seasonality. And then you talked about getting some operating leverage into 2014, so does that mitigate that impact? And then secondly for Rich, perhaps you could just talk about marketing because that was one point you made into 2014. I was just wondering kind of how much of that number is discretionary and how much of it is allocated to cards. And to the extent that you're not seeing the growth, how much of that can you kind of pare back?","Gary L. Perlin","Okay, Sanjay, it's Gary. Let me address your question. Looking now at Slide 11 of the presentation in the appendix. We've given you the quarterly estimates for this year of the impact to Best Buy, because you're going to see those playing through from one quarter to the next. If we closed late in the third quarter, we wanted to show you what you might expect in terms of impact in the fourth quarter. But as I said earlier, it would be wrong to simply take the fourth quarter and annualize it in terms of the opportunity cost, both because of the additional non-interest expense that we expect that we can take out of our base, some of it related to the moving out of that particular partnership. But also because the revenue stream associated with that book of business we would've assumed would have started to decline because of the choices we've made around some of the card practices. I mentioned payment protection being one of those. In terms of the bottom line EPS impact, remember, as well, that there's not only the opportunity loss of the earnings. But to the extent it freeze up the capital, to the extent we're able to use that freed up capital to repurchase our shares, we think we can mitigate significant maturity of any opportunity loss in terms of EPS. Rich?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes. Sanjay, on your question with respect to marketing, we have the whole information-based apparatus of Capital One geared toward very rigorous measurements about what we're marketing and what we're getting for that. We don't measure success of marketing by our loan growth metric. It's really measured by the creation of value and before we originate, after we originate and after programs have aged for many years, we, of course, we estimate and then reestimate and go back and assess and see what we have learned. In this environment of certainly not a lot of torrid loan growth, there still is good opportunity to create real value. And we are very comfortable with what we see and  we have a lot of evidence for the, I think, the positive choices that we're making. And that's why as we're managing expenses so tightly, we're sort of separating out our kind of commitment, if you will, that this is where we think operating costs are going to go. And then the marketing call, we'll continue to be more of a line of scrimmage call, really based on what we see the market has to give us.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I was hoping you guys could help me reconcile some of the commentary, just trying to make sure that I understand how you guys are thinking about the capital return from a value-creation perspective. You've described the value-creation aspects of capital that can be freed up and returned as a result of Best Buy. But my understanding was that you guys had paid an 8.25% premium or thereabouts to acquire the Best Buy portfolio and you, essentially, got back par for it and now you're returning that capital. So can you kind of help me understand the economic value-creation element of that? And then I have one follow-up.","Gary L. Perlin","Sure. Bill, it's Gary. And the premium that we paid for the HSBC business of just over 8% was across the entire business. We obviously, ascribe different parts of that premium based on the value that we thought existed in various parts of the portfolio. We ascribed very little value and therefore, very little of the premium, to the Best Buy portfolio. And so that's how it looks to us in terms of being able to get back to a point where we're really creating value by returning that capital and improving performance.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And the follow-up is, there's been some evidence that post the payroll tax cuts that lower-income customers has faced greater level of financial stress. Have you seen any signs among your -- certainly, if not at an overall aggregate basis, maybe just within some of your lower-income customers of any kind of weakness from that subgroup?","Gary L. Perlin","No. Bill, we have looked specifically actually for that effect. There are several things going on sort of in the broader political marketplace and  we've tried to look for any evidence of actually any of those effects in the actual performance metrics of our customers, overall or within a particular segment. And we have not seen that.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin St. Pierre with Sanford Bernstein.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","On the capital commentary, Rich, I know there is -- there are a lot of investors are going to be happy to hear what you offered. Maybe I could ask you to just take one more step and think about capital deployment opportunities that could arise between here and the time when Best Buy closes and whether you would or would not look at portfolio acquisitions or any other types of acquisitions.","Gary L. Perlin","Well, Kevin, first of all, overall, as a general comment, we believe we have plenty of capacity to return capital to our shareholders and add attractive partnership relationships. In 2013, I think, in particular, any deal would need to be an extraordinary opportunity with identifiable near-term returns to forego an opportunity to return capital to you in 2013. I mean, I think we're really kind of saying we're going right down this path. It's a very near-term path and we want to make sure that -- I mean, it's been an important event here to have the Best Buy portfolio. Even though we valued it at par, it's a big event when this comes out of the portfolio. And we've got a lot of capital in a sense sort of trapped in the company here. And we want to make sure that we get this out as fast as we can. But I don't think that, that will take away from our opportunity over time, Kevin, to get the kind of attractive partnerships that are out there and that we're well positioned to take advantage of.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great, that's clear. And then just a quick follow-up. Just to clarify the -- your outlook for operating expense in 2014, that would be inclusive of any savings related to Best Buy?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, that's correct, Kevin.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Brendler with Stifel.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I had 2 questions, the first one being relative to Domestic Card business. Can you give, Rich or Gary, any sort of metrics or sense that the strategy that you're embarking on -- it's obviously a difficult macro environment to grow that business. But you seem to be spending a lot of money on marketing. The spending growth, the purchase volume growth has been fading a little bit. That could be macro. You're still doing better than most of your peers, but the lending growth has been challenging. Do you feel like you're getting a good ROI on your investment these days, all the money you're spending on marketing, in all the television advertising. And you -- Rich, you referenced the fact that these transactors, they don't tend to create balances right away. But is there a potential that some of this growth you've been putting on from these high-spending transactors could just spool up and start to add more meaningfully in later years? Any signs of success would be helpful. And I have a follow-up as well.","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, Chris. So the -- so metrics for the strategy that we're embarking on, I think, the -- probably the most significant metric I would point to is in the sense of risk-adjusted margin that, in our business, we are -- we are so focused on doing the equivalent of a mini stress test on every kind -- every origination that we do. We have, over our long track record, been very, very focused on what is the credit risk and what is the revenue that we have to protect that and how does that revenue behave under stress. Now of course, The Great Recession was kind of Exhibit A of that. But I would point right now, while we spend a lot of time talking about growth metrics to the very, very strong returns that we have in the business. And in our branded books, those returns are higher because those are blended with partnerships that are an auction-based business and it's inherently -- it's an above hurdle but lower-return business than, certainly, the business that we spent all these years building here. So that, the revenue and the credit is really the heart of that thing and, therefore, really, the ability of this business to really generate returns. Now there's another very important thing that's going on that probably slows down our growth in what is a little bit of a seam, but I don't want to overemphasize that. But that is just the -- this emphasis on creating value through kind of long-term franchises. So the classic long-term franchise is this -- the heavy-spender marketplace. And these cost a lot of money to acquire. They have the lowest attrition rates of anything that I've ever seen in the Card business and that's a great thing, too. But these things build over time. And yes, the more traction we have with that and the more other things settle out, that will continue to build success. But it will happen even more so, I think, on the revenue side than on the -- just in terms of balances. Another metric related to that, though, is something that we don't -- we have to sometimes give you a little more color on is what's the relationship between purchase volume growth and interchange growth. And there's also been a transition as we've gone out with more of an emphasis on getting these new transactor relationships and more of our mix comes from the new high-value reward cards instead of just the building of balances by the rest of our portfolio. The interchange growth has lagged the purchase volume growth overall. And they also have to normalize for the partnership side of that, which has a whole different kind of economic. But anyway, long story short, the interchange growth has now also caught up to the growth of purchase volume in our branded book. These are all things, some of it kind of beneath the surface that you can't see, but showing the sort of vertical things catching up with the tremendous horizontal economics that we have. But slowly but surely also, we are continuing to build revolver customers. We just tend to shy away from the big balanced ones. But on a broad basis, we're continuing to build that business and they're generating very good returns with high resilience. So we feel good about this. The key thing is, we just -- to us, is we've got to make sure that we respond to the opportunity we see in the market. Right now, the best opportunity is to really make sure that we maintain our margin and get capital to shareholders even as we continue to build a long-term franchise and look forward to also the runoffs subsiding, which will also really get the metrics going.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. I'm sure macro and higher consumer confidence would also help. A related second question is HSBC. And I know you guys are fanatics about testing and measuring and evaluating your own performance. And is this a transaction that you'd still do again? I mean, we're kind of struggling at this point to see the financial benefit. Are there strategic benefits? The private-label business, I think, has the potential to be something special in a mobile world. Is this part of the strategy that private label could potentially be a growth engine for Capital One over the next several years?","Gary L. Perlin","Well, Chris, I think that because there had been so many moving pieces, it's hard for -- it's hard to really kind of see the absolutely separable effect of HSBC. But I want to show it through -- I want to talk about it a little bit as we have seen it. We initially set out to buy $30 billion of this and then -- and we talked about that and arranged a capital raise associated with a bit of a larger number. As you know, by the final time -- the final thing that we bought and paid for was around $27 billion something. But since then, everything about the HSBC deal has come in consistent with own expectations. Even paradoxically, our hunch that the Best Buy portfolio was something that, in fact, we might be able to move out early. We valued it at par. We didn't know what the timing would be and so on. But our initial hunch was this wasn't going to be the right probably fit with us strategically. It might be great with somebody else. And so that has even moved along in a sense consistent with expectations. So we're still very happy with this deal. I think that the bigger kind of story there is in the face of the challenges in the marketplace and the weakness of demand and all the building of pressures on expenses that -- in the regulatory environment and everything else, to really make sure that -- I mean, our job is to drive the real return and shareholder value that can come from the position that we have put ourselves in and now with this deal coming on, these 2 deals coming on. And that's what we are very, very focused on. So yes, we still very much like this deal.","Operator","We'll go next to Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Rich, could you actually talk about the credit card runoff over '13 and '14? Is that going to include the underlying loan growth that you're talking about that's already net of that? And what are the characteristics of those loans that you're running off?","Richard D. Fairbank","The credit card runoff is, the size of it, it is $2 billion. And I'm looking for an itemization of this. I don't want to do just do this off the top of my -- oh, you got it.","Gary L. Perlin","Well, just getting back to Moshe's point, it's $2 billion in '13, about $1 billion in '14. And to your question, that's a gross runoff, Moshe. That is not a forecast of what our actual balances are going to do. That's the amount that we're going to have to build in order to stay even. Obviously, as Rich has said, we're looking to build. And we expect to offset some of that runoff. But it's just the runoff amount. It's not an assumption about where overall balances are going.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And what distinguishes those loans from the rest of the HSBC portfolio?","Gary L. Perlin","And again -- well, as far as the HSBC loans go, Moshe, as Rich described, it is the -- mostly the less resilient of those loans that as they pay down, we'll see them start to run off. Also included in that number is the runoff of the very tail end of the closed-end loans that have been accounted for as part of our Domestic Card segment for many years.","Richard D. Fairbank","And in fact, Moshe, by -- if you forgive me for possibly being only directionally accurate, I -- as I do recall of the $2 billion we're talking about in '13, $500 million is the Installment Loan portfolio. That number goes to about $200 million in 2014. So what we have in this runoff portfolio is mostly the HSBC runoff. And essentially, just to give a little more color on that, Moshe, it is some of the highest loss, in our opinion, least resilient part of the branded book that we got from HSBC. So you have some of the really kind of lowest-margin stuff with Installment Loan and some of the kind of highest-loss stuff. Things like the old metrics book.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. The -- on the Payment products, could you just remind us what you're doing going forward and what the impact is going to be as those run down?","Gary L. Perlin","The Payment Protection, Moshe?","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. Payment Protection, yes.","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes. So Moshe, as we announced in the -- it was actually, I believe, in early a year ago that early in the year, we shut down the origination of Payment Protection products in our Credit Card business. And so we announced there would be a -- the economics of all of that is on our existing book. We would continue the Payment Protection products, but it would just be a case of the math of runoff from there forward. And by the way, also on Best Buy, there was kind of a similar effect that was part of the declining economics of Best Buy that Gary had talked to you be about. Gary, do you happen to have the -- talk to Jeff to maybe get the component of that runoff. We did give some information that from which you could determine the kind of annual effect of this tail, Moshe. We're not in possession of it right at this moment.","Jeff Norris","Moshe, it's Jeff. I can get you that. I don't have it in front of me right now. It -- the story, though, is that it hasn't changed our estimates. And the run rates we're absorbing haven't changed. And what we're seeing is consistent with what we laid out a couple of quarters ago.","Operator","We'll go next to David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And I was wondering if you guys could speak a little bit more about operating expenses and marketing expenses. And if you were to do a little bit better than your target, where do you think there could be some additional savings? For example, in marketing, as you do more and more cuts for acquisitions online, shouldn't that be less expensive than direct mail? And where else could you save some money on expenses, do you think?","Richard D. Fairbank","Well, let me start with operating expenses. Operating expenses is -- this is not a program, per se. This is, what we're talking about here, is a central basic way of life of running this business. And there are a number of factors that are significant macro trends that give an opportunity for continued expense opportunities beyond the kind of forecast window we're talking about. And even in the forecast window, we're taking advantage of some of these. But you've got the whole trend toward digital. So it happens on the -- that's not only in the marketing side. But the more and more customers that we can get into digital servicing, there's a key thing there on the Retail Banking side, the more and more customers that we can get to really become digital bank customers instead of such heavy users of the branches. Even the role of things like smart ATMs that we put all over our network, these are important trends. But they don't happen automatically, David, they have to be actively managed to get the customer behavior changes and then to make sure that the money drops to the bottom line. We are also working to drive significant improvements in technology delivery. And really, the way that we do IT projects, these are very complex projects and we've done a lot of process redesigning that and there's significant opportunity there. The -- one of the big, big themes around banking is complexity. Banks have inherent complexity. But certainly, with all the things that have become part of what running a bank is these days, there's a lot of leverage to complexity reduction and we're all over this. And -- but I do want to say also, again, we just bought ING Direct. That is the leader in the way banking is going to be in the future. Now in a few ways, they were maybe too far ahead of their time and this is not a change that everyone is ready to sign up for right now. But I think there are big opportunities there. There are big opportunities in procurement. Big institutions like our own have very big, third-party expense budgets. And to really, really drive best-in-class kind of procurement capabilities, this is incredibly important as well. So our entire -- I mean, we are just laser-focused. Because I -- as a guy who came out of the strategy business, I want to go -- I want to say what I think -- what we've always said, what is strategy? Strategy isn't about bubble charts and just about market position. Strategy is about finding where the leverage is and driving great outcomes. The things we're talking about here have tremendous leverage over a long period of time. And we are sizing them, driving them, and we want to make sure that, that's going to be a key way from customers to economics to the customer experience that we stay ahead in this marketplace.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And the same things would happen in marketing, do you think? In leverage?","Richard D. Fairbank","Oh, sorry. And just in terms of marketing, one thing I want to say is that mail has a role -- mail is certainly declining over time, but mail has a role that is a different role than digital originations have. And that is that mail allows you to proactively target in ways that actually aren't -- are not possible on the Internet and so on. So we -- look, I mean, we are a big player in digital originations, but our choices on the direct-mail side, the nice thing is we have an absolute expense. We have a response rate and we have the economics that allow us to very efficiently measure how and how fast to drive down that cost as the world changes.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I guess on capital return, when you think about payout ratios, should we be thinking about it against GAAP earnings or some kind of cash earnings concept that's closer to the actual annual capital generation?","Gary L. Perlin","Well, Brian, I think you'd really want to mostly be thinking in terms of GAAP. Obviously, most of the non-GAAP impact on revenue will be completed in 2013. So all that's really left next year will be the significant but predictable and slowly declining impacts on operating expense. But in general terms, Rich is talking largely GAAP, but with wide enough range, would probably cover both.","Brian Foran","And then just on the expenses, I mean, the comments you've given are definitely very helpful and kind of show where you want to go long term. If I just think about the Card business and expense to loans, I know it's not a perfect metric but it's one metric. You're kind of at 9% this quarter, 8% and change last quarter, expense loans and Domestic Card. And I guess, historically, used to be -- to be like 5% to 6% and some of your peers are still around 5%. Can you help us kind of dimension how much of that is temporary versus how much of that is business mix changes or regulatory changes that have happened just as we kind of think about where that could go long-term?","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes. Brian, look. We have very energetically benchmarked ourselves by expenses relative to just about every dominator that we can find out there. And I want to say a few things. First of all, there are certain things that create near-term pressure on expenses that -- and ratios like Best Buy coming out and certain things like integration costs and other things that are a little bit more in the temporary thing. One thing I do want to say is that I think our expense ratio to loan is inherently higher than other players because of our strategy of pursuing -- of kind of avoiding the higher balance accounts. And so expenses -- loans don't actually drive expenses, they drive charge-offs, but what drives expenses is really accounts. And on a per-account basis, our metrics are much closer to some of the other norms. But all that said, where we absolutely need to go from here is to continue to drive more and more efficiency. And there are a lot of different levers to do it and that strategy, with a capital S, that's where the opportunity really is. And that will help us preserve what has been something we've treasured for a long time, is to have returns at the top of the industry in the Card business and then helping us to have returns for our overall corporation that are at the higher end of banks. And so again, always look ROA, again, as one of the key metrics there. Okay?","Operator","We go next to Daniel Furtado with Jefferies & Company.","Martin Kemnec - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Martin Kemnec in for Daniel Furtado. A question for Gary relating to the Domestic Card business. Can you help me, kind of, just -- just aggregate how much of the $5.3 billion decline in card balances was kind of seasonal? And what was related to the runoff portfolios?","Gary L. Perlin","Well, Martin, it's hard to pinpoint the run-off portfolio. The 2 things that would've been driving the decline in loans, first would've been per card. It would have been the move of Best Buy loans to held-for-sale. So you're going to see a reduction in the held-for-investment loans. And then the balance is largely going to be seasonal. So actual runoff would be hard to measure and is almost certainly a very small portion of that, it's the seasonal effect of going from fourth quarter to first quarter, plus the impact in moving the Best Buy portfolio to held-for-sale. Remember that was done on February 1.","Operator","We go next to Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","2 questions. One, first, on strategy with what you have today and then on growth. On the International Card, that business really hasn't grown in a long time, I guess the card industry hasn't grown, but does this strategically fit, Rich? Does it -- I mean, do you have an international strategy beyond the markets that you're currently in, a growth strategy to move into new markets? Or does it make sense to sell those portfolios and redouble your efforts in the U.S.?","Gary L. Perlin","So, Bob, we are in Canada and in the U.K. in credit cards only. And we chose those 2 markets, it doesn't -- one didn't have to hire McKinsey to figure that one out. I mean, in a sense, they're the markets that are most similar to the way the marketplace works the availability of data and a lot of things. It was kind of a natural to go there and it helped that they spoke our language. But beyond that, all jokes aside, we are not at this point -- we're very focused on the agenda that we've talked about here. Those 2 businesses, I think, the Canadian business has been a good earner for a long period of time. The U.K. is -- had a couple of challenges along the way. Certainly, the amazing WACC the whole industry has taken on some of the payment protection thing has led to some charges and so on. But we think we're well-positioned in both markets. And while geographically they look far away, synergistically, it's just like another part of our Card business. We transfer talent across, we use them as training grounds for talent, new insights come out of those 2 marketplaces that we adopt here. It is synergistic, it makes money and I think it's an appropriate thing to continue in our portfolio even as we're not pushing out farther in the geographical expansion.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, the Payments industry is more dynamic today than ever. And it seems like maybe Capital One who has always had a really good Credit Card business might be at a little bit of a competitive disadvantage versus some of the dynamics going on in the industry. Many of your big competitors are either closed loop or owned merchant acquirers, which we know with the JPMorgan Chase Paymentech with Visa strategy. Does -- with the capital that you have, is there -- are there any thoughts of investing further and, say, buying a merchant acquirer or other -- investing more heavily in other areas of the Payments business that could be synergistic with your U.S. Card business? Such as prepaid or...","Richard D. Fairbank","Bob, we -- Chase, of course, just announced this little opportunity they're working with, with Visa. That, I think, pretty much all of the card players in the industry jumped to attention on that thing. And we -- look, I don't think we know much about that. I think that it's a divergence from Visa's normal, more level playing field, treatment of the industry here. But we're all over kind of paying attention to that. It would be -- the answer is no, we're not out looking to go deeply into the merchant-acquiring business. Probably like any bank, there's some areas that we have disadvantages, but look, I think the -- I really like the positioning we have. We are not looking to significantly change the bone structure we have. What I really want to do is capitalize on the opportunities to create value with the bone structure that we have worked for years to get and I think we're particularly well-positioned.","Operator","We'll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question relates specifically to revenue margin, my -- probably my favorite topic for Capital One. And I'm hoping you might be able to provide a little bit of context around the 123 basis point lift that you're getting from the Best Buy part of the portfolio coming out. And when you look at that, it's 1633 net of the 123 basis points, it's curiously similar to the first quarter 2012. And I just want to understand how you think that's going to migrate over the next few quarters once the Best Buy portfolio is completely out of the numbers.","Gary L. Perlin","I'll start. It's Gary. Rich might want to add a few things. First of all, let me just remind you that in addition to the impact that Rich described of the Best Buy in Q1, it will have an incrementally higher impact on Q2 because we'll have 3 months rather than just 2 months in the quarter when any of the reversals of finance and fee charges will not be going through revenue but they'll be going against the mark on the loans. By and large, most of what we've seen otherwise has been kind of normal seasonal impacts. But again, you will see some pretty big impacts over the course of the year. The Card business, in particular, when we're looking at revenue margins, because the revenue from the Best Buy portfolio will show up in the numerator of that calculation, but the denominator is just loans held for investment, so excludes that -- I mean, that's going to be the biggest single driver along with, kind of, normal seasonal trends, at least for the next couple of quarters.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then as a follow-up, just with the $40 million revenue lift that you pointed out from the fee reversals. Is that just -- that you had $265 million of revenue suppression? So without that, it would've been $305 million? Am I understanding how that is running through the numbers correctly?","Gary L. Perlin","More or less, yes.","Operator","We go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions. One was, I just wanted to follow-up on the expense side. I want to make sure I understood what you're saying regarding where you anticipated expenses to go from 2013 around $11 billion, net of the marketing expense, to $10.4 billion, is that accurate?","Gary L. Perlin","Yes, that is, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So excluding the integration and the acquisition-related costs, that essentially means a 3% decline, which seems eminently doable there on this non-marketing expenses. On the marketing expense side, though, I guess the question is if you're looking to replace the runoff portfolio to the degree possible, does that imply either an increase in marketing expense to try to incent either usage or track new card accounts? And if you could also give us some color on how progress is going on implementation of the CARD Act changes that went into place last fall on extending line utilizations, is there balances for card? Or is there any progress there you can talk to us about and help us understand how to get the balances up?","Richard D. Fairbank","Okay. Yes. So on the expense side, Betsy, you've got it right with respect to $10.4 billion. And again, from the $11 billion going down to the $10.4 billion, that's $100 million of acquisition-related intangible amortization, a decline in that. $160 million of integration costs that we'll -- that we have to manage to come out, but we're dropping that to the bottom line. And then all the rest is just other operating cost savings. When you -- I want to give you a window into how we think of marketing. We're really not out on a quest to replace the runoff portfolio. I mean, to me the runoff portfolio is just a thing that is running its course and, in many ways, it is irrelevant to -- not in many ways, it's just flat-out irrelevant to our marketing decisions and our growth choices net of that. It's very relevant, when it comes to things like capital distribution, it's very relevant that we make sure that we manage our economics working backwards from what comes with the territory with these portfolios running off. But underneath it all, it's the same way we make choices all the time. And we look at opportunities and we model them under stress and we pursue all the opportunities that really look good in that context. And the marketing is really -- the marketing choices are dependent on that. And I think that however you've seen our marketing over the many years, this is really the same whole methodology there. I'm glad you asked about the CARD Act thing because one other factor and we didn't -- we have mentioned it in other conversations but we did not today. One other moderate factor that has held back our loan growth has been the adapting to the regulatory requirements with respect to credit line increases. And let me just talk just a little bit about this. Coming out of the CARD Act in the downturn, the regulators, understandably, have heightened expectations regarding credit line increase programs and put in -- they put in place new requirements on regarding the use of modeled income to demonstrate a customer's ability to pay. And so they, essentially, increase the requirement in terms of validating an assumed income before one could give a line increase. And of course, as you can imagine, we have built very sophisticated models associated with line increases and we have a very dynamic and ongoing and important line increase strategy with respect to our customers. So starting really in 2012, we work to retool, to create a line increase program that met these various conditions. And we're going to be pretty much back pretty close to our run rate later this year, so that will give an extra boost. But it's not game-changing, but it's something that we're -- it's important that we get back to.","Operator","And your final question this evening will come from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","First of all, after the Best Buy news hit, I went back to your April or your mid-2011 filings and looked at the Kohl's portfolio. And that was a $3.7 billion portfolio and it looked like your purchased credit card receivable intangible only went up by $13 million, which is something like 35 basis points. So that led me to think, I mean, here we have 2 cases of these partner cards and you seem to have never ascribe any value to them. And so why is it a good business if we never seem to ascribe value to these? I mean, do you give out just too much of the economics with the partners?","Gary L. Perlin","Let me just answer your accounting question, Chris. So we're typically going to see more value, more PCCR-type value. Whatever premium is paid has to be attributed to the various sources of value and the credit card relationships, because they are direct between us and the borrower, in general purpose credit cards, because those accounts will often remain over many, many years, you'll just see more of whatever is paid associated with PCCR in branded books. So that's what you're going to see there. And if you go back to the Kohl's portfolio, remember the nature of that business, it's very particular, it's a wonderful partnership, it's a -- it's high-performing and they are a great partner. But also, remember that there is a very heavy cost and revenue-sharing aspect to that business, which is also going to affect the economics there. So that's what would pretty much account for what you've seen in those 2 particular portfolios when it comes to PCCR. And remember, value can be ascribed to businesses that's going to be showing up in places other than in PCCR.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Is that kind of typical for a partner card, that it's that low?","Gary L. Perlin","For partner cards, again, there is no single representative situation, Chris, you've got to take a look at the partner, their history, the nature of the contract and what is being paid. But it's going to be different for each one. It's not surprising that we saw what was in there. Also, remember that with these partnership transactions, there is, typically, a -- an expiration date on the contract. There is no expiration date on our account relationship in the general purpose business. So with Best Buy, for example, because the contract was coming due in 2014, as we said earlier this year, all we did was to kind of end that a little bit earlier, that's going to have a huge impact on what's there. So just because there is a fixed term to partnerships, that's going to affect the accounting as well. But I wouldn't read too much into the accounting as a measure of long-term, value-creation potential. As Rich has said, we're looking for good partnerships that will deliver that over the long-term.","Richard D. Fairbank","Chris, let me just talk strategically about partnerships. We have had an interest in partnerships for many years because it's an alternative way to get access to customers. And in some ways, actually advantaged access to customers. Because there are people who do certain things and they choose to do with a retailer and that can be a good thing. And, plus, you have retailers who subsidize the activity and so that can be an economically good thing. Now, it's also been very attractive to us because as a huge player in the Card business, this not only represents a significant additional source of volume, but the skills required are right down the plate in terms of how we operate the business and headlining it is credit skills. And also in some of these partnerships, the ability to do credit across a variety of different customer profiles is also a very important thing to retailers and we have pretty -- a pretty big skill experience at that. So credit and information-based strategy is very important part of that. Now, also very important is expenses. And as -- if you look at the Best Buy economics, it'll show you something that you probably already knew about the business and we know, which is that this is a scale-driven business. So the marginal economics of a partnership, whether it's in unloading Best Buy or whether it's in getting another one, are particularly attractive because there's a lot of fixed cost in the business. It's a scale-driven business. And if you look at the Private Label business, you'll find this is not an all-comers kind of thing. Capital One is third in a business with 3 big -- frankly, with 3 big players, because they're -- it is a scale-driven business. So we have seen some companies get themselves into trouble in this business and I believe what happened is in the quest for scale, they might -- there might have been some indiscriminateness with respect to what customers are being booked or what's happening at auction. So the other thing I want to say about this business is and why it is inherently less profitable than the regular old-branded Card business is it is auction-based, it does have periodic auctions. And the -- that is something that makes it hard to generalize, this is why things are so situation-specific. So while scale matters, what we have said is we want to selectively grow this business, going after great retailers with a strong brand, retailers that view the Credit Card program as a strategic opportunity to build a franchise rather than just a way to make more money and a contract, and this is an incredibly important point, a contract that aligns the parties' interests and has the right market-clearing price to it. For that reason, we stayed out for a bunch of years from that business. We also stayed out because we didn't have the scale to really get -- to get in all that effectively. Now we have the scale. We're in a great position. I think there are relationship benefits to the incumbent that can help you in auction time if they like how you're servicing them. But bottom line, this is never going to scare the branded Card business in terms of its returns. But relative to the opportunities that we see in banking and across Capital One's portfolio, I think it offers well above hurdle rate returns, but it has to be managed selectively. And that selectivity is both in choosing new partners and also being willing to sometimes move on from some of the ones we have.","Jeff Norris","Okay.

To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our first quarter 2018 results.","With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Scott Blackley, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Scott will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and the press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that the presentation may contain forward-looking statements.

Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. And for more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our Annual and Quarterly Reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC.","And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Blackley","Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $1.3 billion or $2.62 per share in the first quarter. We had one adjusting item in the quarter, which was $19 million of restructuring costs. Net of this item earnings per share were $2.65. A slight outline in adjusting items can be found on Page 13 of the slide deck.","Pre-provision GAAP earnings increased 3% on a linked quarter basis and 8% on a year-over-year basis to $3.3 billion. Provision for credit losses decreased 13% on a linked quarter basis and 16% year-over-year primarily driven by smaller allowance builds in our Domestic Card business.","Let me take a moment to explain the movements in allowance across our businesses, which are detailed in Table 8 of our earnings supplement. In our Domestic Card business, we built $59 million of allowance in the quarter reflecting seasonally adjusted growth and the moderating impacts of growth math.","The allowance in our Consumer Banking segment increased $11 million driven by growth in our Auto business and net reserves in our Commercial Banking segment decreased $33 million primarily due to paydowns in an improved risk profile. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.2%. We have refined our estimate of the impact of the new tax law and we now expect our 2018 corporate annual effective tax rate to be around 20%.","Turning to Slide 4, you can see that reported net interest margin decreased 10 basis points from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by day count and an increase in rate paid for deposits, which was only partially offset by higher asset yields in mix.","Net interest margin was up 5 basis points on a year-over-year basis resulting from a higher mix of card assets on the balance sheet. As of the end of the quarter, our net interest income was modestly liability sensitive to implied forwards and a flatter yield curve would create a modest headwind to earnings.","Turning to Slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 10.5%. Last quarter, I shared that we expected our CET 1 ratio which is our binding capital constraint to trend back towards the mid 10% range. Since then there have been several developments that have affected our capital requirements. These developments include a more severe 2018 CCAR assumptions that were provided by the Federal Reserve in its stress scenarios.","More severe Federal Reserve CCAR loss models are coming for a card and subprime auto, and of course, the impacts of both of these developments are compounded by the associated incremental disallowed DTA resulting from the loss of the NOL carry back.","Giving these developments, we now believe that our CET 1 ratio will trend up to around 11%. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 200 million of common stock and in light of our updated view of capital. We do not expect to use any of the remaining authorization for the 2017 CCAR approval window, which ends June 30, 2018.","Importantly, this view does not incorporate any of the potential impacts from CECL implementation in 2020. With respect to CECL, we were pleased to see bank regulators acknowledge in their MPR that the initial challenges of CECL implementation, but they didn't go far enough.","Our current capital regime was built around incurred loss allowance model and under CECL we will shift to a lifetime loss allowance, but we've seen no comments or shift in capital frameworks. We view the potential increase and allowance from CECL, as simply capital in another form and since the MPR doesn't allow for Tier 1 capital relief, it will all else equal simply cause banks to hold more capital.","In addition, CECL has the potential to be very procyclical and we will discourage loan growth, especially in recessionary periods and will make financial statements less comparable and less useful. We will continue to advocate the bank regulators and the FASB to carefully consider all of the impacts of CECL.","So with that, I'm going to be turning the call over to Rich. Rich?","Richard Fairbank","Thank you, Scott. I'll begin on Slide 8 with our Credit Card business. We posted strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and pretax income driven by the performance of both our domestic and international Card businesses. Credit Card results also benefit from the absence of any additions to our U.K. PPI reserves in the quarter, which adversely impacted the first quarter of last year.","On Slide 9, you can see the first quarter results for our Domestic Card business. As a reminder, Domestic Card results and metrics now include the impacts of the Cabela's portfolio, which are playing out as expected. Ending loan balances were up $7.4 billion or about 8% compared to the first quarter of last year. First quarter purchase volume increased 18% from the prior year. Revenue for the quarter increased 6% from the prior year. Revenue margin for the quarter was 15.9% down 36 basis points from the first quarter of 2017.","Strong net interchange revenue partially offset the expected margin pressure from Cabela's. Non-interested expense increased 7% compared to the prior year quarter. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.26%, up 12 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.57% down 14 basis points from the prior year, both metrics include the benefit from adding the Cabela's portfolio.","The competitive marketplace remains intense, but generally rational. Supply of card credit is on the high side, although it is settled out a bit. We continue to see good opportunities to grow card loans and purchase volumes with a watchful eye on the marketplace.","Slide 10 summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Ending loans grew about 1% compared to the prior year, while average loans were up about 2%. Growth in auto loans was partially offset by planned mortgage runoff.","Ending deposits were up 3% versus the prior year with a 23 basis point increase in average deposit interest rate compared to the first quarter of 2017. We expect further increases in average deposit interest rate driven by higher market rates and increasing competition for deposits.","The Auto business continues to grow. First quarter auto originations were strong and ending loans were up 10% year-over-year, competitive intensity in auto is increasing, but we still see attractive opportunities to grow. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter increased about 4% from the first quarter of last year driven by growth in auto loans and deposit.","Non-interest expense for the quarter decreased 4% compared to the prior year quarter driven by our ongoing efforts to tightly manage cost and the exit of the mortgage origination business last quarter, partially offset by continuing growth in auto. Provision for credit losses was down from the first quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of lower auto charge-off rate and a smaller allowance build. In auto, we remain cautious about used car prices and our underwriting assumes that prices decline. As the cycle plays out, we continue to expect that the auto charge-off rate will increase gradually.","Moving to Slide 11, I'll discuss our commercial banking business. First quarter ending loan balances decreased about 2% year-over-year and average loans decreased 3%. Both trends were driven by our choice to pull back in several less attractive business segments in the second half of 2017. With many of these choices behind us, ending loan balances increased about 2% from the sequential quarter.","First quarter revenue was roughly flat year-over-year as strong non-interest income in capital markets and agency offset the decline in average loans and the effect of the lower tax rate on tax equivalent yields. Excluding the net impacts of the new tax law, revenue would have grown about 4%. Non-interest expense was up 3% primarily as a result of technology investments and other business initiatives.","Provision for credit losses was actually a benefit of $14 million in the quarter driven by lower charge-offs and a larger allowance release as compared to the first quarter of last year. The charge-off rate for the quarter improved to 11 basis points. The commercial bank criticized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.7%, down 40 basis points from the fourth quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.5%, up 10 basis points from the fourth quarter.","Last quarter, we shared with you that we had moved the vast majority of our Taxi Medallion portfolio to held for sale, which drove most of our fourth quarter commercial provision expense. During the first quarter, we sold most of this portfolio and realized the small gain. We have just over $40 million in remaining Taxi Medallion loans and assets on the balance sheet, which are carried at a valuation comparable to the recently completed portfolio sale.","In the first quarter, Capital One delivered year-over-year growth in loans, deposits, revenues, and pre-provision earnings. We tightly managed costs even as we continue to invest to grow and to drive our digital transformation. Total company ending loan balances grew 3% year-over-year and we still see opportunities to book attractive and resilient loans in our card, auto, and commercial banking businesses. We expect marketing in 2018 will be higher than 2017.","First quarter efficiency ratio improve year-over-year as revenue growth outpaced the growth in non-interest expense, while efficiency ratio can vary in any given year. Over the long-term, we continue to believe that we will be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth in digital productivity gains. As always, marketing expense will continue to be driven by the opportunities and requirements of the competitive marketplace.","We expect long-term improvements and total efficiency ratio will mostly come from improving operating efficiency ratio. We continue to expect a majority of the tax benefit will fall to the bottom line this year, while it's still early to have a definitive observations and conclusions, we continue to believe markets behave in predictable ways. A surge in tax benefits has a way of working its way into the marketplace through increasing competition, including higher levels of marketing and lower prices.","Responding to these actions, we will likely consume a growing portion of the tax benefit over time. In addition, we will also continue to lean into our investment in talent, technology, innovation, brand, and growth. We are bullish about the long-term benefits of our investments.","Taking all of this into account, we continue to expect that our current trajectory coupled with the new tax law will enable us to accelerate full-year 2018 EPS growth compared to full-year 2017 EPS growth, net of adjustment and assuming no substantial adverse change in the broader economic or credit cycles.","Pulling up, we continue to build an enduringly great franchise with the scale, brand, capabilities, and infrastructure to succeed as the digital revolution transforms our industry and our society. Our digital and technology transformation is accelerating. We are growing new customer relationships and deepening engagement with new and existing customers, and we are strengthening our position to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create long-term shareholder value.","Now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.","Leanne, please start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. Rich, I was hoping that you could, I mean you alluded to this in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about seeing opportunities for growth in a market that you kind of defined is still rational. Maybe if you could kind of flesh that out a little bit kind of where within the credit spectrum, what have you seen in terms of both the supply of credit and the ability to if your borrowers to support it in the market and how has that influenced to your thought process?","Richard Fairbank","Okay. Thanks Moshe. Good afternoon. So if I calibrate, so we had a big surge of growth in 2014 through 2016. And as you know, Moshe we are very sensitive about what is the supply demand situation in the marketplace being so cautious about oversupply. And we saw a window that we said at the time gave us I think an exceptional opportunity to grow and get the kind of performance that we wanted and we went all in on that.","Starting in 2016 and sort of into 2017, we saw a big surge in industry supply. Well it actually started before that, but there was a big surge in the industry supply. In early 2016 we started making our cautionary sounds about look that will probably have ripple effects on some of the performance metrics in the business, the credit performance metrics in the business, and sharing off those performance changes. I mean that's nothing overly alarming to those performance changes we saw in our own and in industry metrics in 2016.","And so we dialed back to more moderate growth rate. Dial back basically around the edges, across our revolver programs and you see the slower growth in 2016 and you can see growth has been pretty slow at this - to this quarter that we're reporting today. I think I would describe the generally things have kind of settled out in the environment not in a huge way, but just in a moderate way. You can see supply has little bit settled out even though supply is still on the high side, and clearly the supply, the growth of revolving credit is well above the growth of the economy et cetera.","So certainly we'll call that one on the high side, but kind of settling out. If you look at industry practices, pricing and various things I think there is a rationality and a stability to things. Competition is fairly intense especially on the very high end of the marketplace. But I would call it kind of a settling out period. I think we see an opportunity for attractive growth in this environment, not like a big surge like before, but I think that we still feel optimistic about the ability to have appropriate attractive growth in this environment, not like a big surge like before.","But I think that we still feel optimistic about the ability to have appropriate attractive growth in this environment. You talked about where across the credit spectrum that we see that would really say that across the areas that we tend to invest in, we see some attractive growth opportunities.","We continue to be going very hard at the top of the marketplace has a very competitive there. I think that the people who will succeed and are succeeding there are those who invest for years in building a brand and sort of the benefits of staying power in that particular area, but we continue to like our results there and you can see we printed them some pretty good purchase volume growth metrics.","In the revolver space, across the credit spectrum I think you know there is an opportunity, kind of medium size opportunity there. So we'll be very vigilant along the way as we read the market conditions and act appropriately, but I think that we do see some opportunity for growth.","Moshe Orenbuch","And just the last part of that it was whether you can ever see anything in the kind of customer base from employment or income standpoint that would make you kind of more or less enthused?","Richard Fairbank","Yes, I think for the consumer, things look pretty strong in the near-term. I think they're benefiting from job growth and wage increases maybe a bit from Tax Cuts. And so I think the consumer and the economy sort of in which the consumer is a big part is in the near-term in a pretty strong and stable place.","Now when you look out a little bit farther, there are a number of things that are still considered can concerning like growing consumer indebtedness, growing the government deficits and a number of issues, but almost all the issues are a bit farther out.","So all of that adds up to a view in our case that there is a. Kind of middle of the cycle field to where we are right now. I think that we have some attractive opportunities to grow, but one has to I think bring a very careful and wary eye to work every day because there are a number of factors out there that could get a lot worse from here.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. When I look at the monthly progression of the U.S. card credit metrics, they paint a pretty positive story, delinquencies are down year-over-year, the charge-off rate seem to be trending down year-over-year now. Could you maybe help us reconcile your expectations for the charge-off rate to be up this year given this phenomenon?","Scott Blackley","Well, Sanjay, first I don't think we've given any guidance about the 2018 full-year charge-off rate. I think that we've historically been telling you that we expected that the increasing pressure year-over-year basis from growth math was moderating and that's what we've talked about. I mentioned that that is having a modest impact on the allowances we've seen that the income down. But Rich, I don't know if you want to make any other comments about that?","Richard Fairbank","Well, maybe it's appropriate to kind of just seize the moment and just talk about growth math and where we are on that. If we kind of pull back over - our journey of the last several years, the reason we talked about growth math was to highlight the impacts of our outsized growth relative to the rest of the card industry.","And that surge turned out to be from 2014 through 2016 and since then our growth has been moderate. If you combine our vintages of outsized growth, 2014, 2015 and 2016, their losses have stabilized and now actually started to improve. And our newer vintages 2017 and forward are in the early seasoning phase with increasing losses. And this is a natural way that seasoning works in the Card business.","When you net these two effects, the result is the small tail of growth math we have spoken off, but pulling way up we're near the end of the growth math story, and from here we expect our credit will be impacted more by the economy, the competitive cycle, and other industry effects.","And these factors are more likely upward than downward and they will - on our portfolio will ultimately be a blend of all of these effects, but I think the thing we wanted to point out is that the surge if you will from 2014, 2015, and 2016 those vintages actually have turned to the positive.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. I mean I guess just a follow-up on that. I mean do we think that now the charge-off rate could then come down for the year relative to last year? And then just one question on the CCAR comment, Scott. Could you maybe just talk about how the more onerous expectations affect you are ask this time around, I mean in terms of just dimensionalizing that? Thank you.","Richard Fairbank","Sanjay, we're not - it's been our norm over the 20 some years we've been a public company, not to give specific credit guidance. And I think our view is since now we're kind of beyond the growth math story and our credit is going to be driven mostly by industry factors.","We give you a little bit of a window into what's happening along the way with that thing I'll call that the surge over the three-year period. But I think we're now - it's probably less of a Capital One specific story and more about industry factors, but we will have a bit of the beneficial impact of the surge being a very gradual.","All other things being equal, a very gradually beneficial and again, everything being precisely equal something that is over the rest of it life sort of having being a modest good guy as opposed to the \u201cbad guy\u201d it has been for several years as the losses have been so frontloaded.","Scott Blackley","Sanjay, on the CCAR. So I obviously can't give you much information about our 2018 CCAR submission. I will kind of just pull up and first talk about the whitepaper that the Fed released on its modeling. We don't have any more information about how that's going to impact us than you do. We've made assumptions about that in terms of dimensioning the 11% that I've told you that we're going to be trending towards. So I'll just make a couple comments about what I think looking ahead for capital.","I think that we're going to be trending up towards the 11%. I would think that we'll get there over the next 12 months or so for sure. I would think that when I look at our earnings capacity, I think that we have their earnings capacity to have support growth to support our capital trending up and for the opportunity for some continued capital distribution along the way. So we're looking at all components of that as part of our dynamic management of our capital levels.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next questioner from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Donald Fandetti","Yes. Good evening. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about sort of your view on industry card loan growth. If you look around a lot of the issuers are tightening up underwriting on the edges, yet the consumer is in very good shape. Can you talk a little bit about the outlook there and also the competitive dynamic you've got the Fed continuing to raise rates? You've got corporate tax rates that have been cut, are you seeing any changes in the competitive behavior from some of the banks?","Richard Fairbank","Right. Don, I'm not sure that the industry is pulling back as much as it's kind of settling out. It was clear that the growth in the Card business, the growth of supply was surging over the last couple of years. It seems to have settled out around 6%, subprime growth rate surged quite a bit higher than that and it's now come down, but it's still a little bit higher than the prime rate.","So again, my characterization of that would be supply is on the high side, but kind of settling out relative to the pace it was going one in two years ago when we were raising some alarm bells. At the top of the market, there is tremendous competition at the top of the market, and the top competition shows up in rewards offerings that not only our card players actively putting some pretty aggressive things out there, but retailers are kind of jumping into the fray there's been a lot of competition on rewards themselves. Intense marketing associated with those and my expectation is that that will continue. I see nothing abating about that.","You asked the question about the impact of taxes. Both intuitively and in any retro studying we have done when a windfall happens to come to companies. Intuitively and empirically, it seems those windfalls end up making their way into the marketplace. Now one of the frustrating things will be and I'll say it in advance now.","We won't be able to measure it and we won't be able to ever attribute any particular thing to that in the same way when the windfall from bankruptcy reform that happened in the [indiscernible] ended up making its way. I would argument to a pretty unhealthy way into the Credit Card marketplace, again, who can attribute cost to all of these things, but the striking thing in the wake of that sort of the industry got a little bit overheated and competitive in some unnatural ways.","But my points are even kind of larger than a card industry point, I think as a corporate America point, where the big windfall is my expectation over the course of say the first year, most of that I'd certainly speak for Capital One. When I look at our own actions, I think that this thing looks like it had to default to the bottom line, but I think my cautionary words to all of us is, I would expect in little ways here and little ways there this will make its way into the marketplace in the form of more investment, more spending, pricing in various ways such that it kind of gets competed away which is a good thing from a societal point of view and how in the end giving a break to corporations has a way of making it self broadly available into the marketplace.","So although we won't be able to measure it, we are assuming over time in our own planning that the marketplace will get more competitive and those are my cautionary comments. And in the end, the one thing we'll know is we don't really be able to measure that effect. So if I pull way up though, I still a pretty bullish about the opportunity in the Credit Card business. I think it's a reasonably stable time in the industry. We know which direction in the credit cycle things are moving, but I think there's a window of opportunity to still have some good growth.","Donald Fandetti","And just a quick clarification. If I look at your funding cost on securitized debt and senior and subordinate notes, it looks like they went up a lot the yield quarter-over-quarters, so anything to call out there was just sort of normal progression?","Richard Fairbank","Yes. Most of our wholesale funding is actually swapped out to three-month LIBOR, so it's really reflective of kind of the great moves and we saw a little bit of disconnect in the three month LIBOR, which run through that for most of those items.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Richard Shane","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the impact of higher deposit costs and higher rates on funds transfer pricing. I realize it's a net - it's a zero sum between corporate in the consumer bank, but I am assuming that is rates rise, the bank would be more profitable at the expense of the corporate another one and just like to go through that a little bit?","Richard Fairbank","I think as a really broad principle, I think you're right. I think that the - we transfer funding costs from the other segment into the retail bank and its rates rise that spreads going to be more beneficial. And so all things being equal, I think that's likely going to be true.","Richard Shane","Scott and how often do you reprice that just so we understand think about the dynamic in a right way?","Scott Blackley","Yes, we do that on more or less a monthly basis is the process that we follow.","Richard Shane","Okay, great.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good evening, guys. So I just wanted to ask a follow-up to one of the questions that was asked earlier regarding credit note. We've obviously seen two straight months of improving charge-offs in delinquencies Rich? Do you talk about the 2014 through 2016 vintage - vintages are starting to have some gradual improvement. So given that we're now a couple months into the year with both losses and delinquency down on a year-over-year basis and seemingly we should have more tailwinds from this.","Scott Blackley","I guess what would we need to see from - if I'm assuming the environment is going to be stable, what would we need to see for losses in delinquencies to actually start going up over the course of the year. I think the point that there's no full-year guidance, but I'm just trying to understand unless it there's a big change in the operating environment why would losses start to go up?","Richard Fairbank","So I think small changes in the environment can very easily happen. They can come on little cat feet. I'll give you an example of just what happened in 2016. Now in 2016 we were just beginning to - we were in the last year of our growth surge, but we started raising alarm bells about some of the supply things we saw going on and sure enough when you look back and by the way at that time one can't really see things particularly on origination programs and things like that.","But if you look back at the period where I would say the card industry worsened of it, starting in the second quarter of 2016 particularly on the origination side where the industry, vintages from that period started gapping out.","There was a worsening there and then we also saw that over the 2016 and 2017 period that the good guy the back book had been for so many years we'd almost all forgotten, where the back book not only was stable, it actually was getting better and better that that moved to stable, and then actually for several quarters and you can see this is an industry phenomenon. It was Capital One and you can see it in the securitization trust for the industry, actually worsen.","Now both that the origination effect that that we noticed in the second quarter of 2016 and this back book effect that went from good guide neutral to even a worsening that seems to have settled out a little bit, but those are things that that can happen very easily and while there are always can be economic effects that cause them.","The thing that I most focus on those things can happen very easily by competitor actions in the marketplace extra supply, changes in underwriting at various things. So my only point is that this is why we're not really in the credit guidance business because what we want to do is be in the credit guidance business when we have unique things to talk about - about our portfolio that wouldn't just fall of the industry things. So look, I think the most important thing that I have to share with you is that our 2014 to 2016 surge has turned into a gradual good guy.","So whatever thing that happens from there whether the industry gets worse or better or whatever, we will have that little benefit on our own portfolio and it may be beneficial relative to other card players. And put another way as we've talked about it is we're farther along in the later innings kind of growth math and some of the other players. So I think Capital One will carry that particular benefit whether losses go up or not for us in the industry I think is something we'll have to see.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And I guess if I could ask one follow-up, Rich you've been spending heavy on tech for the past five years, but we still managed to see 330 basis points of efficiency improvement in the last two years. However, I think over half came from lower marketing and lower amortization. So as you continue to get more benefits from these analog cost saves and maybe we start to see some of the investments sun setting, could we actually start to see the savings that you're seeing coming through on the expense side accelerating and maybe we could see a little bit lower expense growth going forward? Thanks.","Richard Fairbank","I think we have one growing benefit and one less benefit than we had on something like efficiency ratio relative to the last few years and not even counting by the way your point on amortization. But I think the benefit that will grow over time is the relative meter between the increased investment in technology, which has been going on for years and the meter of the savings that we get because we're investing in technology. And what I've been saying for a long time is Capital One was way out there from the beginning, saying well some banks are saying they're going to sell fund their tech investment.","I want to make one thing clear, we're not self-funding this thing. It's going to cost more before it costs less. So we have continued to invest heavily in technology and we will continue to invest heavily in technology and there are many benefits that come from that. And cost to me isn't even at the top of the list and we're not doing it primarily for cost benefits. However, with respect to cost, there are two growing good guys to offset the continued investment in technology.","One is tech savings on tech spend, so a bunch of that that we're spending a lot in technology and is starting to actually create some tech savings. The other thing is really helping to grow the meter of sort of one minus tech spend across the company. And this is a gift that will keep on giving over time. And so what I've always said is I'm not ready to predict whether it could be that tech spends will grow as far out as we can see because at some point we all become just tech companies that's all we are.","But the thing that is clearly going on is our - that tech is starting to save on itself and one minus tech spend that the savings meter is starting to grow, and I think that's going to be a gift that gives for a bunch of years. Now the one thing that's not as helpful to us over the next few years relative to what we had as our efficiency ratio is pretty steadily marched down over the last few years is basically the growth rate of the company. We were able to have the - it was really nice to have a pretty rapid growth rate and just not grow cost as much.","So we've got our work cut out for us more with more moderate growth rates that's going to be a bit harder work, but we believe that. And a very important way our investors will be paid and an important manifestation of the benefits of really transforming the company into a tech company that does banking instead of a bank that you like I think, so many in the industry bank that use this technology is that we should be able to have the benefit in the operating cost over time.","In any particular year, we're not really into the near-term guidance on that. The only other thing that I wanted to say just about efficiency ratio and you may have noticed the distinction that I made that what we believe over the longer-term overall efficiency ratio will be a good guy over time.","I think that marketing, we've already said we expect to increase marketing over time. We had earlier questions on this call about the very competitive card marketplace et cetera as we look around. We expect to continue to invest heavily in marketing. I think it's really important to the growth opportunities of the company and for the brand and ultimately where we need to go as a company. But even in spite of higher marketing spend, we are very hopeful for the continuing benefit of operating cost through technology savings to carry the day.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good afternoon.","Richard Fairbank","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Couple questions. One, I just want to understand - make sure I understand what you said about the CET 1 ratio, the capital ratio. So I think you said that over the course of next three, four quarters you expect you can get it back - you can get it to around 11%. Do I take that to mean that from there you anticipate holding it at 11%? I just want make sure I understand the drivers behind why you feel the need to go there and how we should expect a trajectory and what kind of leverage you're planning on pulling to either maintain or to get there?","Richard Fairbank","Hey, Betsy. Thanks for the question. So I did say that I would expect that we would get to around 11% over the next 12 months or so from here. I think that we've got the earnings power that's going to allow us to accrete to those levels and at the same time support growth and the potential for some capital distribution as well. As we think about kind of where we need to be, I think 11% is kind of where I see the company needing to be with our current mix of business.","The one thing that is out there that we're going to need to keep a close eye on a CECL and it's kind of the way CECL and its implementation comes out. We're likely to at some point going to have to take and adjust that 11% for what we see and what we learn about kind of how CECL is going to be implemented in stress testing and the day one effect at CECL. So those are all the things that I think that I have to say on that topic.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Just because the timing doesn't have to do in part with what the CCAR test was like this quarter. Is it at all around Fed parallel run on Basel II? Is it a function of what your outlook is for credit losses, just trying to understand the timing of this currently around 11%?","Richard Fairbank","Yes. Well the timing is mainly - I'd previously mentioned that that we thought we need to be around 10.5%, and since then we've gotten additional information from the Fed about them incorporating updated models in card and in subprime auto which are two big businesses for us. So we're trying to make sure that we don't get caught behind the April on any of those items.","Betsy Graseck","Thank you.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. Rich if I may, I'm just trying to sort of aggregate the responses to several other questions that have come before, so I can sort of understand where the real pivot points in the income statement exist. So is this a fair characterization, I mean what we're going to see is sustained, but relatively low growth a little bit of margin benefit as asset yields outpace changes in cost of funds and operating and provision benefits relative to the prior year as the primary drivers of EPS growth, is that basically correct?","Scott Blackley","Hey, Eric, I think that when it comes to margin, I think that what I would say is, if you look at our sensitivities to further rate changes. We're basically neutral to imply forward. So I don't anticipate that you should expect a benefit with Capital One from further rate.","In fact, we're slightly liability sensitive and so that that can be that's again - that's in a shock scenario. So we're slightly liability sensitive there and then I would also add that we are sensitive to the shape of the curve. So if we were to see a slightly flatter curve that also can create a headwind perhaps to net interest margin.","And then I think when it comes to operating efficiency, as Rich just said that's something that we've given guidance that we believe over time that's a metric that we will see trend down. We've mentioned that we anticipate increasing our marketing spend versus 2017.","And then on the growth side, I think I would just characterize that as we think that we've got a pretty good competitive environment to compete, and so we're not going to see kind of the same growth rates that we were able to kind of in the 2014, 2015, 2016. We think that there's an opportunity for us to have healthy and reasonable growth.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks and if I can just follow-up on one point. I was trying to calculate the marginal cost of deposits and it looks like the delta there in cost was about 33 basis points and Fed funds were up about 34 over the course of the quarter. Is that - is my math is in the ballpark?","Scott Blackley","I think that you're in the ballpark in terms of total costs. Certainly, we had a number of - we talk a little bit about the wholesale funding going is being indexed to the short end of the curve three month LIBOR. So that picked up all of the change there. So basically a data one and then we also had some higher rates moving up in our commercial business as well as some of the more competitive aspects of savings in CDs. So those were all the things that contributed to that that move up in average deposit pricing.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kenneth Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Bruce","Thank you and good evening. I'd like to ask a question on credit and look I understand you're trying to get out of giving any direct guidance and so I won't ask for that. But if we look back at the last couple years of growth and you pointed out that there was inflated growth continue through 2016.","There is also a pretty significant shift in the mix of Capital One's business towards [sub 650 FICO], and that has come off pretty dramatically off - over the last few quarter. So is it fair to assume that as we look forward that slower growth in that subprime portfolio should begin to accelerate the - if you will the improvement or the downward pressure from there kind of reverse growth math over the next call it 18 months?","Richard Fairbank","Ken, I probably - I mean mechanically what you say would be the way things would work at the subprime mix, goes down and we have seen the subprime mix has declined recently, I do want to say Cabela's is a pretty significant contributor to that impact.","These are also numbers that are like rounded off to the nearest integer kind of thing and I wouldn't want you to take away that things have changed relative to the mix of Capital One business. I think things are very similar to how they've been for a long period of time most of our pull back around the edges was like you all are revolver business is in a way just trying to be cautious in the context and industry getting a little bit carried away.","While continue into pretty intensely go after the top of the marketplace. So I think things are going to be pretty consistent from the mix point of view as a general observation, but that number will bounce around and Cabela's has brought it down relative to the highs from a couple of quarters ago.","Kenneth Bruce","Great. And our math would support that just the growth that you had in 2016 in particular is going to actually start to give you some of downward pressure on loss rates into 2018, so we're bit more optimistic about that that maybe you, my follow-up question is on the\u2026?","Richard Fairbank","Ken, answer, can I? The one thing I wouldn't take to the bank because I don't take it to our bank is the vintage, vintages in general I think the way to think about vintages is that for a couple of years there are very clearly sort of bad guys and then there's kind of a stabilization and then there's this kind of over the rest of its life all other things being equally very gradual kind of positive right. So one thing that I've always been struck by is each vintage has a different personality that where it actually peaks the exact timing of when they turn.","So I wouldn't lean in too hard to any particular vintage and count on that being a big contributor. But all of that said, the physics - number one, when I've come out with this growth math term, I've said look I can't be precise about exact timing at magnitude of things, but it's sort of physics.","The physics works as you're saying. I just wouldn't lean in too hard on any one vintage really being a significant contributor to this year's performance, particularly 2016, which is the youngest of the three that I talked about in the surge. Anyway, sorry go ahead I interrupted.","Kenneth Bruce","Yes. No, caution noted. I guess that my follow-up is just if CECL is going to create this potential capital event, would do you think about changing the mix of business that you were willing to do based on the potential like a loan loss expectations that had to go into that math?","Richard Fairbank","Yes and the one thing I would just say about CECL. I think CECL is going to have an impact on a number of different asset classes. I don't think this is just something to be worried about with whether it's card or auto for us. When I look at it's really going to have an impact on any type of asset that has a long life where you're going to have to extend your coverage from what's a one or two year coverage window to a life time window.","I think with card, one of the challenges with card is because it's a revolving asset and with CECL you're setting an allowance based on the outstanding balance. We may see that card isn't the asset class that's most impacted by CECL. But I think that the biggest challenges for CECL that I see are if you're going in and out of a cycle, it's really going to be pro cyclical and it's going to really put a challenge for all banks, not just Capital One for all banks. I think it's going to disincentive wise loan growth in tough times. Sorry to carry on there, but I think those are - they're broader impact than just in Capital One.","Scott Blackley","But Ken I actually want to follow-up on the strategic spirit of your question. If you pull up on frankly the Credit Card business in general, subprime cards in particular. The tax on them if you will over time is pretty striking the capital requirements that have continued to build the stress test, modeling about that business, because it's a higher loss business, the front loading and then with FAS 166\/167 bringing all that into front loading, the impact of a rapid growth in the business then you bring the CECL effect. This is a lot of tax on the business.","What is clear to us we have to make sure that that we are risk adjusted return in the business like this is robust and resilient to all of this. I'm hopeful over time that that a rational industry incorporates these things I mean these things should show up in the form of higher required returns, higher pricing for the risk and things like that.","One thing it does do is scare off a lot of players who dabble in this space and so I think it's pretty clear that people are going to have to really - I think that that people are going to have to really be good at this in order to do it and be very successful.","But I think it is worth taking note on how much the tax on really most consumer lending in general has gone up in the banking business and now look in the end as markets equilibrate over time, I feel that that in the nature of our potential competitive advantage is the same.","But we can't get there by just going in and doing the same thing and making the same assumptions we've done that we used to do and we ourselves have to ask it to deliver even more given the tax on it.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our final question tonight comes from Chris Brendler with Buckingham Research Group.","Chris Brendler","Hi, thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I think just focus on the non-interest income in the Card business for a moment, I think you mentioned the strong net interchange growth, but I think you've had some FX in this one and before anything to call out in that strong double-digit growth, the interchange either on the interchange reward side that's driving that.","And as well that the service line, service fees and that statement as well sort of speeds are up for the first time in a long time I think you can pulling back on some of those credit products other to a non-leading related fees in the Card business and looks like that may reflected as well if you just had any insights on those to be the great things?","Richard Fairbank","Yes, why don't I just start up on service charge? The service charges when you're looking at that on the year-over-year basis just remember that last year, we had a UK PPI charge that was around 37 million that impacted Q1 2017. So that's impacting that period-over-period and I just also mentioned that as part of the new accounting standard that we adopted.","We reclassified about $18 million of FX related fees that used to run at the contrary to the service and got moved down into the operating expenses and so that's impacting Q1, but not in any of the prior period. So that's - it's really just some of the mechanical things that are impacting that trend line as opposed to core business things.","Chris on the interchange side, we - as you've seen for years really the growth in purchase volume has well outstripped the growth in interchange revenues. Second thing I think has been very striking and it's what's behind your question is this number bounces all over the place and it's almost in any one quarter and especially be looking at growth rates any one quarter not only does that quarter bounce, but we're comparing it to a year-ago quarter that had its own bouncing dynamics to it.","So I think it's kind of structural in the marketplace that the interchange growth is less than the growth in purchase volume because of the growing competitiveness of the marketplace and the growing penetration of great rewards products to all the players including Capital One, broader customer bases.","But I also pleased to see though that even in the tremendously intense interchange race that we are - I mean the rewards competition that we see that it is the case if you pull way up from this bouncing ball. You see that year-after-year Capital One's been posting pretty solid net interchange growth in the face of all of this competition and all the moves to extend into broader parts of our customer base, and I think that that's a manifestation of the fact that.","While we're competing very intensely, we keep our pencils very sharp and to make sure that's a collective economics of what we're booking is something that can really reward us over time. And we continue to believe in the economics of this franchise, we're investing so heavily in this top of the market spender business. And I think that - while this is a particularly high quarter and I wouldn't take that one to the bank. I think that the fact that there is real interchange growth is real.","Chris Brendler","Great. Thanks. If I could ask one follow-up on credits in a different way and so looking at the loss rate, looking at the provision expense and reserve building, subprime loans in the mix you mentioned is actually - they are actually down on a dollar basis, so it's includes the Cabela's as a fact. Subprime is gone negative, our delinquencies are negative, loss rates are improving, and growth is slow. Any reason why reserve building shouldn't continue to slow from here in the card business?","Scott Blackley","Chris thanks for the question. Look, I would just say that when it comes to the reserve that's a really dynamic process. You know that a small changes in expectations, given that we've got $100 billion card portfolio, a 10 basis point move. There's a $100 million of allowance, and so I think that there are a number of forces. Rich talked about all the dynamics that will impact our overall loss rate. And those are really the things that I think we'll be looking for to drive the allowance going forward as well as just the amount of growth that we're putting on the balance sheet.","Jeff Norris","That concludes our call and our Q&A session for this evening. Thank you very much for joining us on this conference call today. And thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, if you have further questions, the Investor Relations team will be here after the call. Have a great night.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Norris","Thanks very much, Leanne, and welcome, everybody to Capital One's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our third quarter 2018 results.","With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Scott Blackley, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Scott are going to walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors and click on Quarterly Earnings Release.","Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion in the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials.","Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. And for more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our Annual and Quarterly Reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC.","And with that I'll turn the call over to Mr. Blackley. Scott?","Scott Blackley","Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $1.5 billion or $2.99 per share in the third quarter. We had two adjusting items in the quarter, which are outlined on page 13 of tonight's slide deck.","We had a $141 million net gain on the sale of an exited business which was $0.22 per share. We had a build in our legal reserves of $170 million or $0.35 per share related to our ongoing AML investigations from various regulatory and legal enforcement agencies. Part of this build is to pay for $100 million civil monetary penalty, which has been imposed by the OCC as part of the 2015 AML Consent Order.","As is often the case, our 2015 order had a placeholder for civil monetary penalties. This fine represents the next step in our resolution of this matter with the OCC. We have made significant progress against the terms of the order. The remainder of the legal reserve build is related to residual AML investigation risk. As other agencies besides the OCC continue to investigate AML issues relating primarily to our former check cashing business, we will provide updates of these investigations in our quarterly filings. These adjusting items were recorded in our other category. Net of these adjusting items, earnings were $3.12 per share. In addition to these adjusting items, we had one notable item in the quarter which was an impairment charge of $200 million or $0.32 per share related to investment portfolio repositioning to optimize capital and capture increased coupon to benefit future earnings.","Provision for credit losses were down at 1% on a linked-quarter basis and down 31% year-over-year primarily driven by allowance for leases in our domestic card and auto businesses. Let me take a moment to explain the movements in allowance across our businesses which are detailed in Table 8 of our earnings supplement. Improving credit results resulted in $144 million allowance release in our domestic card business and a $75 million release in our auto business. We increased our commercial reserves by $33 million in the quarter as we increased our allowance coverage ratio.","Lastly, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.9%. We now expect our 2018 corporate annual effective tax rate to be around 22% before discrete items. This increase is based on our higher income from gains related to business exits and increases in non-deductible expenses from the legal reserves that I discussed earlier. Turning to Slide 4, you can see that reported net interest margin increased 35 basis points on a linked quarter basis, primarily driven by seasonality, day count, and the absence of the non-recurring items that we experienced in the second quarter of 2018. Net interest margin decreased 7 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by increasing deposit costs. We continue to believe that increasing deposit costs will be a headwind in NIM going forward.","Turning to Slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 11.2%. In the third quarter, we purchased approximately 5.8 million common shares, where $570 million of our $1.2 billion 2018 CCAR share repurchase authorization. We continue to view our capital need based on existing regulations to be around 11% of CET1. We believe we have sufficient earnings power to support growth and capital distribution. And as I mentioned last quarter, how the capital frameworks and CCAR ultimately incorporate the effects of CECL as well as the calculation in the CECL itself may impact our view on our capital requirements. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rich.","Rich Fairbank","Thanks Scott. I'll begin on Slide 8 with our credit card business. We posted strong year-over-year strong in pretax income driven by revenue growth and significant improvement in provision for credit losses. Credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic credit card business which is shown on Slide 9. Before turning to third quarter results, I'll briefly discuss our new long-term partnership to be the exclusive issuer of Walmart private label and co-brand credit cards which we announced early in the quarter. Walmart is America's largest retailer and we have a shared vision of how a card partnership can be a central part of a winning retail and e-commerce strategy. There is great leverage from payments innovation, digital capabilities, data and analytics to deepen relationships, drive digital adoption, and create exceptional customer experience. ","In addition to our agreement to be Walmart's new partner, we're also in the process of discussing the potential acquisition of the existing portfolio of Walmart credit card receivables. As you'd expect there will be a range of potential outcomes until this process runs its course. For now, all of our guidance and forward-looking statements exclude the potential impact of Walmart. Pulling up, we like the economics of the deal and we believe that our relationship with Walmart will generate significant value for years to come.","In the third quarter, domestic card ending loan balances were up $1.6 billion or about 2% compared to the third quarter of last year. Average loans grew about 7%, the Cabela's portfolio acquisition which was completed just before the end of the third quarter of 2017 drove the larger increase in average loans. Third quarter purchase volume increased 16% from the prior -year quarter. Excluding Cabela's, purchase volume growth was about 10%. Revenue increased 5% from the prior year quarter. Growth in average loans was partially offset by a decline in revenue margin. Revenue margin was 16.3%, down 42 basis points from the third quarter of 2017. The expected margin pressure from adding the Cabela's portfolio was partially offset by favorable margin impacts from strong credit.","Non-interest expense was up about 8% compared to the prior year quarter largely as a result of higher marketing. Improving credit trends continued to be a significant driver of domestic card results in the third quarter. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 4.35%, down 29 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.80%, down 14 basis points from the prior year. Credit performance on the loans booked during our growth surge in 2014, 2015, and 2016 is improving year-over-year and is driving most of the year-over-year improvement in the overall domestic card charge off rate, that's why I've said that growth math has turned into a good guy. Pulling up, the competitive marketplace remains intense but generally rational. Supply of card credit is on the high side although it continues to settle out a bit. Against that backdrop, our domestic card business continues to gain momentum. We're booking double-digit purchase volume growth. We're seeing traction in our innovation pipeline. Our investments in marketing are driving strong growth in new account originations and improving credit continues to drive strong income and returns.","Slide 10 summarizes third quarter results for our consumer banking business both ending loans and average loans decreased about 21% compared to the prior year quarter driven by the home loans portfolio sale in the second quarter. The auto business continues to grow with ending loans up 6% year-over-year. Competitive intensity in auto continues to increase but we still see attractive opportunities to grow. Ending deposits in the consumer bank were up 6% versus the prior year with a 38 basis point increase in average deposit interest rate compared to the third quarter of 2017. We expect further increases in average deposit interest rates driven by higher interest rates and increasing competition for deposits as well as changing product mix as our national banking growth strategy continues to gain traction.","Consumer banking revenue decreased about 3% from the third quarter of last year. The revenue reduction from the home loans portfolio sale was partially offset by growth in auto loans and retail deposits. Non-interest expense decreased 7% from the prior year quarter driven by the exit of the home loans business and lower branch infrastructure costs. Provision for credit losses was down from the third quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of strong credit performance in our auto business. The auto charge off rate improved compared to the prior year quarter and stronger than expected auction value drove an allowance release.","Over the longer term, we continue to expect that the auto charge off rate will increase gradually as the cycle plays out. Moving to Slide 11, I'll discuss our commercial banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances were up 2% year-over-year and average loans were roughly flat. Both trends were driven by our choice to pull back in several less attractive business segments in the second half of 2017. With many of these choices behind us linked quarter growth was stronger with ending loans up about 2% and average loans up about 3%. Commercial bank ending deposits were down 7% from the prior year. Several commercial deposit customers are rotating out of deposits and into higher yielding investments into rising interest rate environment.","Third quarter revenue was down 1% year-over-year driven by the effect of the lower tax rate on tax equivalent yield. Non-interest expense was up 4% from the prior year quarter primarily as the result of technology investments and other business initiatives. Provision for credit losses was down 14% from the third quarter of 2017 driven by lower charge-offs. The charge off rate for the quarter was 0.16%. The commercial bank credit sized performing loan rate for the quarter was 3.2%. The credit sized non-performing loan rate was 0.4%. While the credit performance of our commercial banking business remains strong increasing competition from non-banks continues to drive less favorable lending terms in the market place. We're keeping a watchful eye on market conditions and staying disciplined in our underwriting and origination choices.","In the third quarter Capital One continued to drive solid results as we invest to grow and drive our digital transformation and we saw another quarter of credit improvement across our businesses. Looking ahead, we continue to see good opportunities for account originations in our credit card and auto businesses. As you've seen in the marketplace we launched a new card product and we're rolling out our national banking marketing. As a result, we expect fourth quarter marketing expense to be elevated well above the historical seasonal patterns that we typically see between Q3 and Q4.","We continue to work hard to drive operating efficiency as we transform our technology infrastructure and change the way we work. After two years of significant improvement we continue to expect full year 2018 operating efficiency ratio will be roughly flat compared to 2017 net of adjustments, but with the investment portfolio repositioning. Scott discussed at the beginning of tonight's call it will be tight. While the efficiency ratio can vary in any given year, over the long-term we believe we'll be able to achieve gradual and efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains. We expect long-term improvements in total efficiency ratio will mostly come from improving operating efficiency ratio.","Pulling up we continue to build an enduringly great franchise with the scale, brand, capabilities and infrastructure to succeed as the digital revolution transforms our industry and our society. Our digital and technology transformation is accelerating and is powering our ability to grow new customer relationships and deepen engagement with new and existing customers. We're well positioned to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create long-term shareholder value.","Now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.","Leanne, please start the Q&A.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","Rich, just to clarify on the Walmart portfolio, if you were to get just a fantastic price, are you saying you would buy it meaning that there is nothing structurally that would cause you not to, want to own it, it's more of just economics like any other deals. Is that fair, and I know you can't say a lot about it?","Rich Fairbank","Don, we understand this portfolio for us to agree to buy the back book, it needs to be at a price and at terms attractive to us, which will be determined through the negotiations over the next quarter or two.","Don Fandetti","Got it and then just sort of.","Rich Fairbank","There's nothing beyond that.","Don Fandetti","Got it, and then obviously the multiple in the stock is in the sort of high sevens, low eights, and the market is telling us that the cycle is turning, yet if you just looked at your numbers, it would suggest the opposite. Could you talk a little bit about where you think we are in the cycle and are you preparing for sort of a weaker credit environment?","Rich Fairbank","It's a great question, Don, because in so many ways, one can't help, but we struck by just how good the economy at this point is, and in some ways, it almost feels too good to be true, and so \u2013 and that's not a credit card comment. A lot of times on these calls, I'll make comments about the card industry, about card supply, about the consumer. We can talk about those things and, maybe I will in a moment, but you know I think the thing that sort of most catches our attention is, just how many sort of planets have aligned to make this environment so positive right now, but we can't forget the longer term issues out there, the implications of rising interest rates, growing government deficits, trade related issues, and also cumulatively some of the effects that's been going on with consumer indebtedness even though sort of the supply issues out there have gotten a little bit better in recent couple of quarters.","So what we are doing is given the sort of dichotomy, we feel about the environment here, we're taking a little bit of a dichotomous strategy. So we feel really good about the growth opportunities in the card business to originates accounts, we've got a lot of successful programs going on as I mentioned on the marketing side where we of course have seasonally high marketing, but and we're doing some rollouts of sort of, new product rollouts, national banking, and so on, but we're leaning into growth opportunities, and what we're doing, the dichotomous compensating thing that we're doing is being even more cautious on credit lines because it's really not the growth of accounts that creates exposure, the exposure comes obviously really by definition by the extension of lines and the build of balances. So, we've been talking caution for really probably two, 2.5 years at this point relative to credit lines, but within the last year or so, we've even kind of further dialed back on initial lines and on some of the line increase things we're doing, not because of anything that we see in our own portfolio but really more out of this just kind of intuitive concern about the marketplace.","Our philosophy is, let's continue to build the -- capitalize on the window to generate accounts because if you don't - they're not forever available, you need to capture them in the window, but then be extra careful about the extension of line.","Jeff Norris","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Scott, I wanted to make sure I understood the impairment charges on the investment portfolio on its go forward impacts. I think I heard you say it's going to benefit earnings going forward. Could you elaborate on that, and just I want to make sure it's in the other segment in other, I guess non-interest income, right?","Scott Blackley","Yes, so in terms of the impact, you've got it right, it's in non-interest income and it does impact the other segment. Basically, this was a securities rotation, Sanjay. So in Q3, we identified around $3 billion of agency MBS that was in AFS and had a mark of around $200 million loss that was sitting in AOCI. As you know, that impacts our capital position and it creates a deferred tax asset for us. In Q3, we identified that we had the intent to sell those securities and that caused us to move the mark out of AOCI and into earnings, so that's kind of what happened and why we recognized the $200 million.","On a go forward basis in Q4, we've been selling those securities and reinvesting them in current coupon agency MBS. That improves the capital efficiency of those securities, and it is going to increase the yield on that $3 billion by around 200 basis points. So, on a go-forward basis, we would expect to see that improve our net interest margin by just a few basis points. And now, I just also mentioned that during the period that we held those after we put them, we identified this is available for sale. We saw rates move a little bit, and so in Q4, we\u2019ll probably have a bit more of a mark on those before we're able to sell the entire portfolio, so that's kind of the picture there.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay and then second question, Rich. You mentioned that the digital transformation is accelerating and it's helping your growth. Can you provide some specific anecdotes? I guess is Walmart one of them and maybe just how you feel your mode is relative to your peers.","Rich Fairbank","Let's pull way up on the digital transformation. I think this is the most important thing, it's the thing every company needs to be spending more time talking about maybe anything other than just risk management itself given that we're in the banking business. But it is very clear that, banking is going to be totally transformed and everything about how a bank works, as it is experienced from the outside and how it works on the inside, are going to need to change in order to in the end deliver real-time, intelligent, digital customer experiences. So years ago, we declared a bold destination to basically build a technology company that does banking rather than a bank that uses technology and so really starting at the bottom of the technology stack and working up we have been all on this transformation for years and as a lot of work one does on the down deep in the technology stack it's not something investors can see, it's not something the outside world can see. Frankly it feels like that a lot of costs, it can feel like a lot of cost and not necessarily a lot of benefits. But what we're struck by is, everything that we want to accomplish on the technology side, on the - inspect the customers, product - customer experience, product innovation, leveraging machine learning, some international banking aspirations. They all have the same shared path of transformation that they have needed and being really many years now into this transformation we can feel, everywhere we look inside the company this - the benefit is accelerating because each transformation of one thing sort of helped the next.","So the question we're often asked is, that's great and everything but how can we see it on the outside and it is - so where does it manifest itself. Walmart is certainly a specific example of that, there are probably a lot of factors that went into why Walmart made the selection that it did, but I certainly believe that the shared transformation journey we reach in our investment in payments and digital capabilities was a very important part of that decision. We also see it in the customer experience that by all the metrics that we look at, Net Promoter Scores, some of the external rankings that you see out there. Our customer experience has been dramatically improving. J.D. Power each year does a ranking of the best mobile banking apps as an example in 2017 Capital One was number one in that ranking, just came out again few weeks ago, Capital One is number one in that ranking again.","Now we don't - our company doesn't rise and fall based on some ranking out there but these are sort of manifestation of things. I would direct you to look at things like our CreditWise tool. There are lot of folks out there giving credit scoring, information, CreditWise is a tool that allows customers to really deeply understand and monitor their credit scores and it's really a gateway and will be a growing gateway into whole set of experiences that can help people use credit wisely. If you look at our auto finance business Capital One couple of years ago launched the Auto Navigator product that allows car buyers to independently compare cars, search national inventories, negotiate prices and here's the most unique thing which I think is in fact unique, get pre-approved for financing and this is for basically in a nanosecond for any automobile on any lot in America, now that real-time machine learning driven kind of capability you can't bolt that on this - you can't build on the side of a bank. That product stands on the shoulders of years of technology work that's been involved in attracting world class talent, transforming how software engineering is done, rebuilding our technology infrastructure, transforming our data environment, going to the cloud, transforming how we work and going all in on machine learning.","So what happens is, these things any one of these sort of shows up and it's interesting and maybe one looks at it and says, well maybe that's different from another product that's out there. But what I'm struck by Sanjay and I'm not surprised by it because I believe this is really the payoff that will accelerate here, is that going all in on this transformation the benefits one doesn't have to pick one benefit versus another because on the other side of this transformation is the opportunity to be way faster than the market, offer way better product, have way better risk management, along the credit dimensions, fraud, cyber security, that's all shared path, same thing better operating controls in a world where the regulatory requirements and frankly the expectation is on banks to deliver well controlled environment in a complex industry is very, very high. Better economics and all of this in service of the most important thing which is, real-time personalized experience. This is for our customers, not just an app but integrated right into their lives.","So that's the journey that we're on the - we see - the manifestation of these benefits on many dimensions but it will show up more as it will pop up in different ways for our investors. But the final thing I want to say is that, is the efficiency benefits that come from this. Now when one embarks on this journey the efficiency benefits are not immediate. Even though one of the most obvious benefits of technology investment is the ability to get more efficient. What's striking though is, it's not like one invests for a couple of years and then suddenly stops investing. We're investing in digital, we will continue to invest in digital. We will always invest in digital until probably one day we'll look around and a 100% of everything that we do is basically digital. But along the way while technology investment has continued to be significant. We see more, the sort of meter of the cost benefits that come from this meter continues to increase and it shows up in, a lot of saving on legacy technology itself and the ability to really change the direction of the cost of the analog channels and operations in the company.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","So Rich, I was hoping we could start with loan growth. Marketing expense was up a lot in the third quarter as you've been flagging and you're guiding to the fact that it's going to be up a lot again in the fourth quarter and I was just wondering, are you seeing the window for growth reopening, I know that you don't set growth targets, but what do you think this means for this increasing up marketing spend will mean for the improvement in loan growth overtime. Thank you.","Rich Fairbank","So I don't see this, this is not a wind the size of sort of the window that we saw in 2014, 2015, 2016 when we had way outsized growth. What we're seeing is just a lot of traction in terms of generating new accounts obviously, you see the purchase volume numbers, but for a lot of reasons probably many of them related to some of the digital innovations that we have done and some of the things happening on the customer side, we're seeing very nice traction in new account origination and so we're leaning into that. We've already talked about the marketing that goes along with some of these growth initiatives. So the only thing I again want to stress is that, the loan growth is going to be more of a function of what we about credit lines. It's not entirely I mean because that we originate has a credit line on it. And so I don't want to overstate this point, but how we dial the knob of credit lines which will be primarily driven by how we feel, from a line of scrimmage call point of view about the card market place and the economy, that will be the biggest driver of the loan growth. What we're excited about is the ability to generate a lot of accounts, they represent sort of stored opportunity that can be harnessed when we open up those lines at a later point.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And then Scott, you highlighted $170 million reserve build for $100 million the fine for the OCC related to AML. Can you maybe just remind us where you are with the remediation and what additional investments will need to be made to inevitably get out of the consent orders? Thanks.","Scott Blackley","Ryan, so on the Consent Order we've been working on that since 2015. I think we've made substantial progress. I think the bulk of the work that we needed to do has been accomplished and so I don't think that we have a large cost headwind in front of us and we're hopeful to see that thing gets resolved here sooner than later.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Rich, I wanted to follow-up on one of the points you made earlier. On one hand, it seems from the outside looking in, like we're at a pointless cycle where your underwriting standards are leading your growth in auto and card to continue to gradually slow, as we've been seeing for like the last 16 to 18 months in both card and auto. But you talked about leaning into growth opportunities which seems a little bit inconsistent with what we see in the data and so I was just hoping that you could help us reconcile the difference between what appears to be showing up in the data versus the point you made about leaning into the growth and then maybe give us a sense of whether we can expect to see a stabilization in growth at some point.","Rich Fairbank","Sorry, what are you pointing at in particular that says everything would indicate the other direction? Can you just?","Bill Carcache","No, I'm sorry. I was just pointing out, if we look at the year-over-year growth in card and the year-over-year growth in auto, that year-over-year growth is, it's still positive. It's just been decelerating from the peak of you know 16 to 18 months ago. So just wondering if you could comment on that versus [indiscernible] point about leaning into the growth.","Rich Fairbank","So let me talk about card and auto because they're slightly different stories. Let me start with auto. The auto industry over the last I don't know, probably two years has had anomalous situation where even though we're moving along in the credit cycle, the supply and demand situation kind of changed due to the pull back of one or maybe two significant players in the business. So Capital One really leaned into that growth opportunity and ever since we've been leaning into that, we've said overtime that opportunity will regress back to something more normal, but we like the opportunity but let us all remember that where we are in the cycle, let's remember used car prices have been high for so long, we fear the industry forgot about where they are at some point. The only way it's got to be down on some of that stuff. And so, but a lot of the auto growth has been driven by some positive competitive dynamics in the business, those still exists they're not as big as they used to be and so our growth is slowing but it is still there we've got some technology benefits in that space. I think we still feel good about the opportunity, but it's not nothing that would jump be a some big change from the trajectory that we're on.","On the card side, the card industry I've been struck by the stability in the card industry kind of let me just back and sort of describe things that have gone on. I think there was a significant window for growth few years ago, we capitalized on that. Everybody in the industry saw us, supply shooting up, we saw some of the - in the second quarter of 2016 vintage curves across the whole industry starting gapping out and we and a number of other players, all identified this and it was a bit of shot across the bow [ph] to the card industry that don't get to ahead of yourself and I think the industry took the caution to heart little bit. In the meantime the very competitive marketplace, the pursuit of heavy spenders, all the rewards, products, intensity and all of that kind of reached the peak a couple of years ago and it's kind of settled out. so what I see is, a stable and a very competitive but stable [audio gap] and I think relative to what I've seen in 20 some years of having this company a relatively smart industry if you will about the choices they're making such that the card industry continues to offer growth opportunities, not incredibly big growth opportunities but it offers growth opportunities for a number of players in the business who are pursuing their individual strategies. The point I was making is, the particular strategies that we're pursuing, the particular opportunities that we see in the card business are something that we're leaning into, but it's more about account origination and you should not expect that to lead to some big outsized growth of loans because we're simultaneously pulling back out of an abundance of caution on the credit line side.","So it's sort of inside Capital One it feels like we're really leaning into a growth opportunity, for you as investors it probably won't feel as much like that, but that sort of gives you some color on how could I simultaneously sit here in these earnings calls and being saying wow, I see the marketplace got some pretty good opportunities, we're leaning into the growth and then we're posting some numbers that are kind of the low end of the league tables of industry growth. So I think that's the context. Thank you.","Bill Carcache","That's super helpful. Rich. Thank you, if I may as a follow-up. Could you just quickly just elaborate on the competition that you're seeing from non-banks that you mentioned earlier and that's it. Thank you.","Rich Fairbank","You're talking about on the commercial side.","Bill Carcache","Yes.","Rich Fairbank","So I kind of go back to, I start with a little bit of - this is a way oversimplified thing, but if you go back and look at recessions there might be, a lot of truth to this particular oversimplified little maxim, which says after a big recession happens look at which things did the best and be highly sceptical about their performance in the next recession and maybe the inverse is true for those. So what I was struck by in the last recession how well C&I lending did for example in general and then we looked and within the banking space, we looked at for so many banks out of the thousands of banks that are out there, they continue to lose the opportunity to generate consumer side of the business, generate growth there because it is so scale driven and so much of the business is being taken over by a few national players and so, so many banks have been painted into a little bit to a corner of limited asset growth opportunities but certainly seeing good opportunities on the C&I side and so that's kind of I've always felt that - put that in your little cautionary thing.","Additionally what we've seen of course now with the US economy and the years of aggressive monetary policy and accompanying low interest rates, low inflation. Investors have been pushed out on the risk curve to seek higher returns. And this has caused as you know a wide range of assets from equities to credit securities to rise in price. And as these assets prices have continued to rise and yields have continued to fall, we just see investors still searching for other ways to continue generating returns. Sponsors are paying higher multiples for companies, they're using more debt to finance them. It's striking and I looked through the chart the other day that just said the percent of deals that involve weakened assumptions if you will, sort of in the marketplace. There's more aggressive assumptions being used, so even when people are looking at things like EBITDA. The way the EBITDA assumptions are being made, there is weakness all around the edges there. Non-banks unhampered by regulation are accepting more aggressive structures in an attempt to provide their investors return. And this just increase competition has its way of sort of virally spreading out in the marketplace and that has caused lenders to accept lower yields and to give on terms.","Now as a general observation on banks, I think banks have been the pillar of strength and generally of trying to stay very disciplined. But I don't think you can put a wall around these different parts of the marketplace and so we see things on the banking side that would be in the same direction if not the magnitude. So what are we doing about this, so one thing we're watching and obsessing about it, but we like pretty much every other bank that we heard on the call, they're calling for the need to stay disciplined in this case specifically what we've done is, to identify the sectors that are particularly vulnerable to these kinds of trends or have structural reasons that maybe less resilient and we have reduced exposure in those sectors and the fact if you look at last number of quarters probably in the last six quarters, maybe Capital One's loan growth has been pretty [indiscernible] on the commercial side which is really a lot of that been driven by the dialing back and reducing exposures in all of the areas that we identify as having a concern.","So I think as a cross calibration across all the market places that we serve at Capital One. I think the C&I, the commercial lending marketplace particularly on the C&I side is probably one that looks further along in the economic cycle, more subject to the classic ways that lenders talk themselves into you know it's going to be okay, but when I calibrate I feel quite a bit better about the lending conditions that are going on the consumer side.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.","Eric Wasserstrom","Just a couple of follow ups. First Rich, just going back to Walmart for a moment, my understanding was that historically buying non-prime assets was very anathema [ph] to Capital One. So I guess I'm wondering what about this particular portfolio or perhaps the relationship with Walmart itself makes it more compelling to do so.","Rich Fairbank","Well we don't view this deal when we talk about this deal, we don't call it this is a portfolio, this is a whole conversation about a portfolio acquisition. This is a conversation about a partnership with a company that has an unbelievable franchise and is all in on really one of the on an extraordinary transformation in an industry that is having an extraordinary revolution in it, that parenthetically all of us in banking should go to school on; on how that industry is evolving. So we start with Walmart themselves as a partner and the benefits of that relationship. A company with a very strong franchise. They're motivated for the right reason about their card program we've seen a lot of partnership deals out there, where the big objective function is, how can the retailer just maximize profits from the credit card. So Walmart is so focused on leveraging this to build and grow their franchise and drive their digital transformation and finally and the partnership agreement really aligns out economic and strategic interest and that's really important to us because we've seen a lot of things out there, where it might be nice to go sign a contract. But the two parties have very different objective functions just by virtue of the way the contract is structured and we've been vocal about that, as we've gone around in the industry in terms of what we talk about that we want and we think it's best for the partner. So that leaves us then back to the back book or the existing portfolio.","When you look at partnership deals with a couple of exceptions in the industry it is typically the case that back books follow front books, when a retailer switches issuers. There is obviously a lot of benefits from a customer experience and data perspective, but it's not always the back book follow front books and at Capital One we've had circumstances where we've done a successful front book deal without taking the back book and so now finally to your question. We see the business logic to have the back book come along with the front book have it all end in one partner, there's a lot of business logic. To us, it is a about price and terms and you know I think you're right Eric, you followed us for a lot of years, we've been very kind of vocal about some of the portfolios that are out there for sale in the marketplace. In general there are lot of things that we've passed on and for us to, we will agree to acquire this at pricing terms that are attractive to us and which help us mitigate the issues that we've often been concerned about portfolios out there in the marketplace.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great, thank you for that and then just one quick follow-up on the net interest margin. I was just trying to understand the very significant expansion in NIM with the go forward expectation of compression cause it seems like many of that dynamics that might drive that compression going forward, were also evident in this recent period. So I'm just trying to understand like what's causing this change in cadent.","Scott Blackley","Eric let me just go back and talk about the quarter and what happened with NIM in the quarter. So on a quarter-over-quarter basis, net interest margin increased by 35 basis points which is really driven by three factors. First of all recall that last quarter I called out several items that were impacting the second quarter that we didn't expect would go forward. We had the UK PPI reserve build, we had an excess cash position that we had as a consequence of exiting some of our home loans business and then we had the seasonal impact of card yield and balances being lower as customers typically increase payments after the tax season in the second quarter. So all those things we expected to not recur in the second quarter or in the third quarter and we saw that actually came to fruition. And then the other part that I would say is, is that in the third quarter we had a full quarter of having no home loans portfolio in our loan book and so that brought forward some higher yield and then finally this quarter, we actually had an extra day to earn income, so that was a positive.","Now those were all kind of things that moved that drove the performance of the linked quarters positively. I will say that there continue to be a small headwind on a linked quarter basis from deposit cost and that's the one thing that I would expect to continue to a headwind going forward.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Rich, you talked a bit and I know you said not to over rely on it. But talked a little bit about the lower credit lines that you've been offering and can you talk a little bit about how do you balance the risk of kind of adverse selection and how you think about then trying to grow in this environment, is it that more of the growth is going to be in partnerships. I mean, how should we think about it given that focus?","Rich Fairbank","Well Moshe, we are gosh we have many, many years of testing and analysis around that. It's a very sophisticated question, you're asking because a lot of times attempts to mitigate risk can actually cause risk because of the big role of it, as you say selection, be it positive selection or adverse selection plays and ultimately the credit performance. This isn't just an actuarial science that repeats itself all of the time. so we - but there are many positions on the dial on the Moshe and so there initial credit lines but then there's also just the frequency and size of credit line increases and the circumstances under which one granted and I think that we do view there's a quite range over customer relationships in terms of when we sort of monetize the opportunity for greater credit extension, but I don't want to paint a picture of starvation lines that cause people to say that this doesn't have utility to me, these are all within what we see as a sweet spot within the continuum of choices that one can make, there's a sweet spot and we're just dialed down within that sweet spot relative to some other times that we have made choices on the higher end of that sweet spot. The striking thing is, there's just so many balances affected by that choice. For example, this is a thing that you look around the card industry and it's probably true even at the moment, but look at the card industry over the years. So often the greatest loan growth is coming to the companies who in that particular year are dialing up their line increase programs. And so often I think all of us have the mindset that marketing programs are going on and that there must be a one-to-one correspondent marketing programs between marketing programs and accounts being booked and therefore loans.","So we're just - this enables us Moshe to lean in and go really go for the growth opportunities we see without feeling we have to hold back so much and to overlay the caution that we feel is pretty prudent at the same time. Does that make sense?","Moshe Orenbuch","Yes, it does and just kind of follow-up on the questions around Walmart. Could you just talk for a moment about the different approaches you might take to both Walmart relationship and the rest of your portfolio depending on whether you do or do not buy the portfolio from Walmart?","Rich Fairbank","Sorry the different approach is, we might take relative to what.","Moshe Orenbuch","Well I mean, obviously it would increase the size of your portfolio 10% or so and - I mean are there any things that you would do differently in terms of your core growth, if you found out you weren't buying that portfolio or if you found out that you were.","Rich Fairbank","Our core growth in one minus Walmart.","Moshe Orenbuch","Yes.","Rich Fairbank","Our core growth. It wouldn't have any impact on the growth elsewhere because I really want to pull up again. We don't have any growth targets at Capital One. We never set growth targets and I think all the folks who are running different parts of our lending businesses are all out there trying to figure out what is the nature of the opportunity they see and the risk that they see and this is why, Capital One so often business-by-business is either at the top of the leading tables or the bottom of the league tables in terms of growth. Within individual parts of business the same thing is true. I mentioned earlier in commercial, I smiled when I looked at the chart of the growth rate of the different segments of commercial that had and they were in red or green based on what direction they were going and they were pretty darn big numbers in both direction just reflecting differing degrees of choices in individual businesses. Walmart won't have any impact on the growth choices that we have elsewhere and whether or not we get the existing portfolio because all across our card business we're leaning into capture all the growth opportunities that we see and we like our opportunities.","The only thing about Walmart is, just understand that it's going to be a while before we finally start the Walmart relationship from a new account origination point of view, there's a whole bunch of work that has to be done to get ready for this, to get this thing off the ground and so on. So I think the really powerful opportunity for Walmart is not something that going to be very near term thing, but it's really the opportunity to take not just a pretty big company but a Fortune 1 company of which there are only one of those and really work together to build an opportunity that can really enhance their franchise and accelerate their digital transformation.","Scott Blackley","Moshe, just one other thing that I would mention before we move on there. One of the things that would be impacted, if we didn't move forward in getting the Walmart portfolio would be our capital position and so between now and when we might acquire that, you may see us accreting capital above our 11% capital needs in the event that we weren't in a position to move forward in acquiring that portfolio and as Rich talked about, we may see that go all the way into Q1 of 2019. I think it's unlikely that we would be able to do anything with capital distribution plans until CCAR 2019, so we would end up probably going into that with a higher capital level, than we otherwise would.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rich Shane with J. P. Morgan.","Rich Shane","When we look at the digital investment and we look at the growth of low loan balance accounts. One conclusion that could be drawn is that you were skewing towards a deliberating this towards a younger demographic. Is that one of the passives what we see going on here?","Rich Fairbank","Rich, I've not looked at data recently to be sure of the answer to that question. I do believe at times when I have looked over the years at our demographic mix relative to others. I have been struck at the younger lean that we have in the business and I believe a number of choices we're making are probably enhancing that, those include the pretty much all of the variations of the things we're doing on the digital side in the card business some of the marketing that we're doing and the challenger marketing probably a little younger leaning some of the marketing stuff that we're doing, the new overlay of the national banking side of this, where as we go out to build a national banking franchise, we're on the checking account side, by definition going to be attracting people that probably aren't going to be highly focused on physical distribution on the branch on the corner.","What we have I think, our opportunity on the banking side will be particularly on checking attractive to the lower, the younger demographic. But let me say there's a flipside to this, which is we're offering some, our marketing is also focusing on hey [ph], by the way Capital One has great opportunities in our savings products and unlike a lot of products out there where there's a teaser rate and then suddenly, now you see it, now you don't. We have very strong sustainably good rates and that is particularly attractive frankly to the older demographics. So I think we've got something for everyone hopefully here. And final thing I would say to is, a lot of our emphasis on that travel rewards a lot of the heavy spender focus we've had at Capital One just ends up being going where the real spending is, which tends to be older.","Rich Shane","Okay, so if my hypothesis in part is right, that there is an element of this putting plastic in the walls of like younger demo with the idea that you can build a relationship overtime. And you're offering them low credit limits to that and as you've touched upon turning up the credit limit as a very easy and successful way to accelerate loan growth. What do you think the timeframe to do that is, is it a year or is it five years, when you look at the customer? And again put this in the context of inability to market to college students the way that you could a generation ago.","Rich Fairbank","So I want to make a comment about, my comment about credit limits is no strategy change for Capital One it's nothing new that I'm saying about credit limits. We've had this strategy for 20 years in terms of every year we make a discrete decision about how much we're originating new accounts and a discrete decision about how much we're building the credit lines and how much exposure that we want to have. So I don't want anyone to go try to figure out the \u201cnew strategy of Capital One\u201d. It's really more to point out the higher than usual at this very moment, separation between growth metrics of purchase volume and the metrics we see on new account origination versus the loan growth which for the earlier question kind of doesn't look like it's keeping up with the other numbers or my words as we're talking here.","I think that Capital One from its founding days has been very focused on creating long-term shareholder value. Everything is in the context of net present value. Everything good I've ever seen has paying first and gained second. In fact, I've learned to almost run from opportunities that I've gained first and paying second because I've learnt that, we as an industry can't control ourselves when that is the case. But from the really founding of the company which took a lot of years, the building of all the long-term data on credit performance from which we would understand how things, where we could extend loans and where we wouldn't, the move to transform the balance sheet of the company out of concern for capital market funding reliance and therefore the deep move in the banking, the digital transformation that we're many years into which I talked about earlier and another one is, the national banking strategy that we're talking about here. What we're focused on doing a building a franchise that will endure and generate tremendous shareholder value overtime and some of things we've been talking about today are just examples of that.","Jeff Norris","Next question please.","Operator","And our final question this evening comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, so just a couple of follow ups here. One, I just wanted to understand Scott when you mentioned that you might be holding onto to a little bit more capital in the event that you would buy the back book. Could you give us a sense as to whether or not that's going to impact 4Q share buybacks or not? And then Rich, I wanted to understand from you what is it about the digital offering that you have that Walmart was so interested in because you did mention about together really delivering a much more enhanced digital experience for Walmart customer? So wanted to understand what you're bringing to the table there and if this is something that could not only make more efficient this relationship but other part of label relationships that you have.","Scott Blackley","Betsy, why don't I start there. I think we have ample earnings power and a starting capital position today, where we're going to be able to support our current $1.2 billion capital plan as well as start to accrete capital for the Walmart transaction should that be something that we end up negotiating a successful agreement to acquire.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, thanks. And then Rich on the question regarding the offering that you have on digital side with Walmart.","Rich Fairbank","Yes, I'm reluctant to use the word offering. I think it's really more the capabilities and possibly really the similarity of the journeys between the two. Now I don't want to speak for Walmart, they really need to speak for themselves. I think their initial press release which talked quite a bit about the technology, thing would be a place to look. But I've really my conversation I don't want to speak for them although I'm very impressed by a number of things they're doing and all in their technology journey. I think for card partnerships for so long the card partnership industry has been especially when you talk about retailers because then there is airlines and other things too. If we just talk about retailers I think the car partnerships have a lot of the partnerships have been focused on how can we just get more cards in people's hands, how can we there are a lot of players who make quite a bit of money - retailers who make quite a bit of money on their card partnerships. There are retailers who make most of their money on their card partnerships and in some cases more than their entire retailing business.","The digital revolution and the e-commerce revolution and the payments revolution has actually brought credit cards into a more central role in the future of how retailing is going to work because on the - for example in the store the card that is used is just the tail on the dog. In e-commerce sometimes it is the dog. The friction associated with how payments work, how people get customers credentials, into a relationship is a different thing. Then you also another aspect of the digital revolution is the tremendous opportunity to build deep customer relationships through data and of course that again, the credit card is right at the vortex of that hole journey. So it turns out it's really hard to bolt payments and data capabilities and transactional and customer experience capabilities onto an existing legacy retailer or an existing credit card company. To be able to break the friction and open up a much, a very large opportunity in digitally driven commerce, be it either in e-commerce or physical retail requires being well down a path of transformation and when both the retailer is and the credit card company, the ability to be able to create customer experiences together, is something that is really hard to, if one of those two partners is not on that journey and it just, I think in this particular case. I think and I'll speak for myself, Walmart can speak for themselves. I'm thinking I'm struck by the nature of the opportunities when two companies in very different industries are struck by the size of the opportunity and the transformation that's necessary to get there.","Jeff Norris","Well thank you very much everybody for joining us on the conference call today and thank you for your interest in Capital One.

Steve?","Stephen S. Crawford","Thanks, Jeff. Let me start out on Slide 3 with a quick review of earnings for the second quarter. We had net income of $1.1 billion or $1.87 per share, which was up 4% from the first quarter. Pre-provision earnings before tax were $2.6 billion, up about 2% from the first quarter. I want to clear 3 items that are worth calling out in the quarter relative to operating trends.","First, you'll see on Slide 3, provision expenses are lower by about $120 million. The change versus linked quarter is really driven by lower charge-offs. We also had nearly a $200 million allowance release in provision, which is consistent with what happened in the first quarter. Rich will spend more time on credit in his remarks.","We also had a $183 million pretax charge in the quarter for Rep and Warranty. And as we disclosed last quarter, there was a -- the effects of moving Best Buy to held-for-sale, which favorably impacts pretax earnings by about $123 million. To clear a question I'm sure will be asked later, I want to talk about prior guidance. We talked in the past about pre-provision earnings of approximately $10 billion, excluding extraordinary items. We still believe we will achieve that with any reasonable margin of error.","And finally, on Slide 3, I just wanted to talk for a second, consistent with feedback we've had from investors, we also have a new non-GAAP disclosure and its income absent deal adjustments. And you can see a reconciliation of that on Appendix A, but that would translate into about a $1.3 billion of net income or $2.18 per share.","Turning to Slide 4, and spending a second on margins in the balance sheet, you can see total interest-earning assets were down 2% quarter-over-quarter. Total interest-bearing liabilities were down 3% quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower funding needs.","The 12 basis point increase in net interest margin you see over the quarter was driven by 1 additional day from the first quarter and by the held-for-sale treatment we've discussed with respect to the Best Buy portfolio, primarily.","As you've seen in our prior disclosures, our balance sheet is asset-sensitive, so the increase in rates will result in an earnings benefit, which will be realized over time. And I want to add, that's all other things being equal. Potential changes in mix, competitive dynamics in our business, credit trends and more generally macroeconomic trends will also contribute to the evolution of our net interest margin. We have expectations for a portfolio runoff, which were slightly updated from what we talked about in the first quarter.","In 2013, we expect about $11.5 billion in runoff, $9.5 billion for Mortgages and $2 billion in Domestic Card, and $8 billion in 2014, with roughly $7 billion of that coming from Mortgage and $1 billion from Card.","On Slide 5 -- I'm sorry, on Slide 4, let me talk about Basel I and capital. You can see that our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is up 30 basis points in the quarter to 12.1%. Our -- our Basel I Tier 1 -- Basel III Tier 1 capital was above our 8% target. It was approximately 8.5%. If you include actually the impact of OCI, which would be about 20 basis points, it would be down to about 8.3%. We are emphatically not changing our Basel III target of 8%, but we continue to assess a regulatory interpretation of the rules that were recently released. I want to end on our plans for capital return. We have received, as you've seen, approval for a $1 billion buy back, which we plan to execute in 2013. We announced last quarter, our plan for a payout ratio in 2014 to be well-above industry averages of around 15%.","And we are still consistent with those plans, of course, subject to regulatory approval. So while we have not changed our forecast for capital return for 2013 and 2014, the uncertainty for the industry's long-term capital requirements has not declined. I want to reiterate the higher payout ratio we expect for next year will be largely, if not entirely, from stock repurchases. We believe our stock is attractive, and we feel that the flexibility in repurchases is consistent with the regulatory push for higher capital.","In all likelihood, the next major benchmark for us on the capital front will be CCAR 2014. It's unlikely that any of our guidance will change in advance of receiving these results in March of 2014. Let me turn it over to Rich to go through some of the businesses.","Richard D. Fairbank","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 7, with an overview of Domestic Card results in the second quarter.","Ending loans were flat compared to the first quarter. Excluding the planned runoff of acquired card loans and installment loans, ending loans were up a little more than 1% in the quarter, in line with historical seasonal patterns. Ending loans declined about 13% year-over-year. Excluding the planned runoff and the movement of the Best Buy loan portfolio to held-for-sale, the year-over-year decline was about 2%.","Looking below the surface, we're seeing strong loan growth and share gains in parts of the business where we're investing, particularly in the transactor segment. Underlying loan growth has been more than offset by shrinkage in the parts of the business we're avoiding, like high balance revolvers, as well as planned runoff. We are seeing -- we're beginning to see more traction in originations, and we are seeing more line increase opportunities as we implement solutions to the regulatory rules on line increases. These improvements will not move the needle on balances until sometime next year and will be muted by the continued runoff of the less resilient parts of the card portfolio.","Purchase volume was up about 12% year-over-year. Excluding purchase volume on acquired card loans, purchase volume was up 9%. This growth remains above industry average and we're gaining purchase volume share. The year-over-year trends in loans and purchase volumes reflect our strategic choices, which continue to focus on generating attractive, sustainable and resilient returns.","Revenue margin increased to 18.7% in the quarter with a full quarter impact of held-for-sale accounting impact. Excluding held-for-sale accounting impacts, revenue margin was 16.8%, a very healthy margin that's consistent with attractive and sustainable bottom line returns. Our card credit metrics improved in the second quarter. On a sequential quarter basis, losses improved 15 basis points to 4.3%, and delinquencies improved 32 basis points to 3.05%. We generally see some seasonal improvement this time of year, although what we saw in the second quarter was better than what we would expect based on normal seasonality, particularly in delinquency rate. Strong credit performance has been benefited by the choices we have made and our strong underwriting. We have a highly seasoned back book, a front book of high-quality origination in highly resilient segments, and a focus on attracting a more disciplined consumer who is less likely to be overstretched or over-indebted. As a result of our choices, as well as the cautious consumer and the recovering economy, the strong Domestic Card credit performance we're seeing is likely to continue.","Pulling up, our Card business remains well-positioned. It's delivering strong, sustainable and resilient returns, consistent with historical levels, even with the inclusion of a lower-yielding partnerships portfolio. And it's generating capital on a strong trajectory, which strengthens our balance sheet and enables capital distribution. We expect these trends to continue as a result of the strategic choices we're making in the Domestic Card business.","Moving to Slide 8, the Consumer Banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans declined about $1.4 billion. About $1.4 billion of continuing growth in Auto loans was more than offset by about $2.8 billion of expected mortgage runoff. Ending deposit balances declined by about $2.8 billion. We have ample deposit funding in a period of relatively low overall loan growth, so we're throttling back on deposit growth. The brand conversion from ING Direct to Capital One 360 has gone very well, and we have continued to see growth in checking accounts across our digital and branch deposit franchises.","Consumer Banking revenue was up modestly compared to the fourth quarter, driven by a modest increase in loan yields and stable deposit interest expense. Noninterest expense increased $20 million in the quarter, driven by operating expense related to higher Auto originations and loan volumes. Provision expense improved in the quarter, driven by the impact of home price improvements and a onetime refinement in our Retail Banking allowance processes. The overall Consumer Banking charge-off rate remains below 1%.","Before leaving the Consumer Banking segment, let's pull up and discuss the Auto Finance business. We've worked hard to put our Auto Finance business in a strong position. We focused on careful and rigorous credit risk underwriting and on building deep relationships with our very best dealers. And we emerged from the recession -- as we emerged from the recession, we were able to grow and take advantage of exceptional trends in competition, pricing and credit quality. As the cycle plays out and competition continues to pick up, we expect the exceptional results of the past 2 years to moderate somewhat. We expect the pace of loan growth to decelerate as annual originations stabilize. Second quarter Auto originations were up about $200 million year-over-year, and remain in the range of about $16 billion to $17 billion on an annualized basis. We expect charge-off rates will continue to increase as the industry continues to normalize to more business-as-usual underwriting following significant tightening during the Great Recession. On a year-over-year basis, Auto Finance delinquency rate and charge-off rate both increased by about 15%, consistent with our internal expectations.","As we've said before, we are now past the cyclical low point for Auto credit, and we expect some softening in historically high used car auction values, so we expect Auto Finance losses to continue to increase gradually from the historic lows of the past few years. Delinquency and charge-off rates remain low by historical standards.","We expect that continuing increases in competition will drive returns downward from current levels. This expected trend of unusually strong results regressing back toward more typical levels is sort of baking in the oven, if you will, in our portfolio as each new origination vintage reflects returns that are modestly lower. Even as returns regress to more normal levels, we still see solid overall profitability and above hurdle returns in new originations. Our Consumer Banking business is delivering solid results and remains well-positioned for the future.","As you can see on Slide 9, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of solid growth and profitability. Loans grew 4% in the quarter and 13% year-over-year, driven by growth in CRE and middle-market C&I loans. Revenues were up about 2% from the first quarter and about 8% compared to the second quarter of last year, driven by growth in loan and deposit balances. Revenues grew despite increased competition and pressure on margins. Our loan yield was down 43 basis points from the second quarter of 2012, which is largely due to the continuing movement of our portfolio to shorter duration floating rate loans with better credit quality, as well as competitive impacts on pricing.","Our charge-off rate in the quarter was 4 basis points. While the current very low charge-off levels are not necessarily sustainable, we continue to see improvements in nonperforming loans and criticized loans, so we expect the strong credit performance of our Commercial Banking business to continue.","Our Commercial Banking business is in a strong position to continue to deliver growth and profitability. While increasing competition, particularly in the middle-market lending space, may continue to impact the pricing and volume of new loan originations, we expect our focus and specialized approach to Commercial Banking will continue to derive solid growth and profitability. For example, we focus on multifamily housing and have a deep expertise in New York City commercial real estate, and we've developed differentiated industry verticals in C&I lending. Across our Commercial Banking businesses, loan growth, credit and profitability trends remain healthy.","I'll conclude my remarks this evening on Slide 10. Our businesses continued to deliver solid results in the quarter. We have great businesses, which generate strong revenues, and attractive and resilient risk-adjusted returns. And we remain focused on important levers that will sustain and improve profitability. On the cost front, we're on track for operating expenses of around $11 billion for 2013, and about $10.4 billion in 2014. Driving digital transformation in all of our businesses, and driving more efficient and effective procurement and third-party management provides sustainable opportunities to save operating costs.","Our outlook for marketing expense in 2013 remains about $1.5 billion. As always, we will make decisions about how and when to spend marketing dollars based on rigorous NPV-based assessment of expected returns on our marketing investment and our current and expected view of opportunities in the marketplace. We are committed to tightly managing costs and operating more efficiently across our businesses. We don't view this as a one-off project. We've internalized that the industry has changed, and efficiency and cost management are very integral to how we run the business and how we create value for our shareholders. It's a focus in all of our businesses and in every budget cycle. Our credit results are strong, driven by our long-standing discipline and underwriting across our businesses and our continuing focus on resilience in the Domestic Card business in particular.","Growth remains a high priority for us, but in the context of a preemptive focus on generating attractive, sustainable and resilient returns. Overall loan growth in the coming quarters is likely to be muted as planned runoff and other strategic choices we've made continue to mask stronger underlying growth in areas we've been emphasizing, including Commercial Banking, Auto Finance and selected segments of the Domestic Card business, including transactors, partnerships and revolvers other than very high balance revolvers.","Finally, capital management remains an important part of how we expect to deliver superior and sustainable returns to our investors. Steve affirmed our capital return commitments for 2013 and 2014. I want to add a few points of emphasis. Our capital and liquidity positions have never been stronger. Our businesses continued to deliver attractive and sustainable returns and generate capital on a strong trajectory. We're comfortable with our strategic footprint, planned runoff, frees up capital, and our stock is at attractive current levels. All of these factors drive our planned capital distributions in 2013 and 2014.","As always, there are risks that are largely outside of our control, which may impact our ability to return capital, but I want to be absolutely clear about our intent to return capital. We continue to believe that we will generate capital well in excess of our needs for growth and risk. So we continue to expect that capital generation and distribution will be important parts of how we deliver shareholder value over the next couple of years and over the longer term. Now, Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?","Jeff Norris","Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session.","[Operator Instructions]","Michael, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I had a couple of questions. First, I know this has been a tough one to answer, but the U.S. revenue margin seems to be doing better than expected when anticipating some of the impacts you gave us previously. Outside of kind of seasoning going forward, do you feel these levels are sustainable? And then second, just the tax rate, if you could help us with what the ongoing tax rate estimate is, that'd be great.","Richard D. Fairbank","Okay. Sanjay, so let's talk a bit about the U.S. Card revenue margin. Using only held-for-investment loans as our denominator, revenue margin in the quarter was 18.7%, strikingly up from 16 -- from 17.6% in the first quarter. And the increase was driven by the incremental Best Buy held-for-sale impacts of about 65 basis points, combined with seasonal marginal -- margin increases and strong credit. And offset a bit by the franchise enhancements we talked about in the prior quarters. The second quarter had a full quarter's impact of Best Buy held-for-sale. And adjusting for that, underlying revenue margin is 16.8%. So when we look out into the future about our revenue margin, there's some puts and takes, but the -- you, of course, have seasonality and effects of purchase accounting, but kind of looking past those, let me just talk about the more fundamental puts and takes. And there's really kind of one primary one in each direction. You have the franchise enhancement activities. This is where we're making choices to -- that end up reducing revenue by changing some of our practices or activities to help enhance our franchise and customer experience. And we have kind of -- we've made some forward-looking guidance about those, and we are pretty much on track relative to those. In the -- the other direction really is the -- is having Best Buy as it moves out of our portfolio. Best Buy has a revenue margin that's lower than the portfolio average. And so these 2 factors generally kind of offset each other in the medium-term. So while there are many other factors that can drive revenue margin like industry pricing and credit performance and growth and adding partnership and things like that, the sort of, on an adjusted basis, as we've talked about this, the revenue margin that we're seeing is pretty consistent with historical ROAs and is generally, I think, from a fundamental basis, pretty sustainable.","Stephen S. Crawford","Taxes -- so in taxes, we were a little over 30% in the first quarter. The biggest factor which drove the quarter-over-quarter increase was an expectation for more income.","There were some discrete items as well. And there's a catch-up adjustment that happens also to incorporate the higher expectations earnings throughout the year. So that's why the tax rate jumped up to 32% in the second quarter. And I can't go out too far, but I would say for the year, it's probably going to be between what it was for the first and second quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I was wondering if you could, I guess, help us think about expenses a little further out, and in a recent presentation, you gave some comments around third-party expenses being high relative to peers and that needing kind of 3 to 4 years to work its way through. And also if you could put it in the context of how to think about expenses within the Card business, specifically. I mean, I just always kind of get hung up on the expenses running at around 9% to loans. And I'm sure you kind of look at it more on a revenue basis, but 9% expense to loans seems like a very high number relative to history and relative to peers still.","Richard D. Fairbank","Right. Brian, let me, in fact, take your point about the Card business. First, I -- there are a number of metrics at Capital One that, because of our business mix and the way we manage the business, that are apples and oranges relative to competitors. And certainly, the cost per balance is a classic one of those. Costs are really driven by customers and our average balance per customer tends to be lower. We have a different mix. We avoid the high balance revolvers. And so we are very focused on really driving to a more and more efficient place in the Card business. But I think that our destination -- we always look at competitors for comparison, but I think that we see real opportunities to improve efficiency. But it's driven in the context of still a very different kind of business mix, particularly as manifested by that metric. Also, if you include in an expense calculation, marketing, we've tended to avoid teasers. A lot of competitors are very heavy -- use teasers very extensively. In some ways, our marketing expense are someone else's balance transfer teasers, for example. So -- but beyond those sort of calibration points, we have great energy and passion around the expenses. And while we are driving efficiency in every single way that we manage the business, we have highlighted both third-party expenses and digital as particularly areas for opportunity. Over the years, we outsourced quite a few activities. I think, in many ways, we -- it may be that relative to a number of players, we have a higher percentage of things outsourced, I'm not totally sure of that. But we believe there is great leverage to really get best-in-class with respect to third-party expenses. And one thing that we have done is to mobilize a lot more of the third-party expense and negotiating activities to a very central -- centralized, highly talented, really experienced team. And we're already seeing in that movement, some pretty significant saving opportunities. So I think there's an opportunity, therefore, some steady increases -- improvements in expense over time. The other kind of biggest one to highlight is in the area of digital. And -- I mean, I think it's not an exaggeration to say we're living through one of the most profound changes that's happened in the history of mankind, and banking is certainly no exception. And frankly, I think banking has been quite belated relative to many other industries with respect to the digital revolution. Most of the things that we're doing to drive leadership in digital are not motivated primarily to reduce cost because I think the benefits are so great with respect to the customer experience, the ability to be fast to market, the ability to drive information-based strategies in realtime and so on. But I am certainly struck by the fact that most transactions, the significant majority of all transactions that happened outside of a digital channel in a bank, either a Card business or in a back, could be done digitally by customers. Now, in the end, they're going to make their own choices, but for us, the drive to digital is a multipronged effort to, first of all, create great digital capabilities and give our customers a customer experience that can enable them to choose digital as a primary way of banking. Secondly, if you build it, they won't necessarily come in the sense that driving customers to digital is a really key part of this thing. And thirdly, the -- digital is not just about how we interface with our customers, but in a sense, digitizing the whole company and really running the company, operating, and most importantly, take the mindset of digital. It really has tremendous leverage to it. So this is not something that's going to transform economics overnight, but I think that both third-party and expense and the digital opportunity give us something that, I think, we can drive to for multiyear opportunities to, in the end, raise our gain, and along the way, get more efficient.","Operator","We will go next to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. I guess first, Rich, can you give a little bit more clarity on your outlook for card loan growth? It seems like there's been some positive turns in the business, particularly in the transactor sector, and you mentioned the pick up in utilization in some of the parts that you're playing now. I know there's still runoff in parts of the portfolio, but what is your expectation when we actually see growth in the portfolio? And a second question, just in terms of, you said you saw seasonal improvement in credit that was better-than-expected. I know you were talking about stable credit trends year-on-year, but could we actually see credit improve year-on-year given the solid better-than-expected outlook?","Richard D. Fairbank","So, yes, Ryan, look, I think -- I'm encouraged by the things that I see beneath the surface in our Card business, in the areas where we're investing. I see a bit -- I don't want to overstate the effect, but I see more traction. I see things happen -- happening a little bit more response. I think that some of the new programs we've been putting in place are getting some nice traction. The line increase brownout that we have experienced, really, since the beginning of 2012, when the regulatory rules changed on requiring validation of income before doing a line increase, we're working our way through -- we're pretty much there with respect to having the capabilities we need to now increase credit lines and so on. I do want to say, though, that the Capital One way of doing the Card business is one where we book accounts and build balances on a gradually, kind of, increasing basis. So this is not a big change that you'll see. In fact, I said that the needle on what I just talked about will really move more next year than this year. But the other thing that makes me still cautious to point to loan growth is that when we talk about running off, the 2 things that we're essentially running down, one is the riskiest parts of the HSBC portfolio, and the least resilient parts of our own portfolio, really more focused around high-balance revolvers. That runoff is -- involves a lot of balances and that each year, we kind of start behind the starting line in generating growth. When you see the bounce in my step and the excitement about the businesses that I know those choices are going to really enhance the resilience of our business. They won't -- you won't get paid for that in the good times. You get paid for that in the bad times. But meanwhile, everywhere we're investing, I really like our chances. The other one I want to say is the other place where I think there's upside from here, but it's not upside that is like right around the corner, is in the partnership space on the organic side. In the last couple of years, really since we announced the HSBC deal, pretty much all of our energy has gone in -- with respect to that partnership business, has gone into doing the integration and re-upping with partners. I think what excites partners about Capital One is the opportunity to create innovative marketing programs and really build business over time. So in that sense, I think some opportunities have been lying fallow, if you will, and can be capitalized over time as we kind of -- in fact, really pretty much at the destination with respect to integration and partner sign-ups. So that's why I've got a bit more of a bounce in my step, but I just don't think you're going to see the metrics, really, moving for a while in any dramatic way. On the credit side, you've heard our comments over the last several years, and we've tended to be -- we never liked to book improvements that might come out in the future. It is certainly striking -- and it's extraordinary, really, what has happened over the last few years as consumers have become more and more careful. And frankly, originators like Capital One and our competitors have also, I think, been particularly conservative in their originations. I think what we're seeing is that as this plays out in our portfolio, the kind of pay off of years of conservatism by us and by the consumer is manifesting even better credit performance than we probably would have expected, maybe the flip side of why we lament about loan growth sometime, that delevering consumer. But I -- our comments that -- I mean, I'm not sure I'm ready to declare that things could get better from here. But I think the trend in credit and when we look at things like roll rates and some of the underlying -- pretty much all the metrics associated with credit continue to show 2 things: One, the payoff from the conservative approach we've taken to originations and all of our credit policy; and second, the consumer that continues to be cautious.","Operator","We'll go next to Donald Fandetti with Citi.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Rich, if you look around some of the other large banks in the card issuing space, BofA has recently expressed more confidence on market share, Wells is talking about more cards and there's some other banks. I guess, we've all become a little accustomed to just thinking cards are a great business with sustainable ROAs and just want to get your sense on any risk around the competitive framework and yields as you look out the next 1 or 2 years.","Richard D. Fairbank","Well, you remind me of back in my consulting days when I showed one of my clients the sum total of the growth predictions of all the players in the industry and said, unless there's a massive revolutionary growth shock to the system, I think we're all going to be disappointed in more ways than one. A thing that I would say on a calibrated -- I mean, so your question, Donald, is a very good one. If I cross-calibrate what's happened in the Card business versus other places, I think the card -- in the businesses we operate in, I think the card industry has been the most rational relative to the Auto business and the conservative -- I mean, the Commercial business in terms of competition in the wake of the Great Recession. You see a lot of folks kind of rushing into C&I lending, you see folks kind of running into the Auto business. In the -- in the Credit Card business, supply has kind of subsided here in the last couple of years and pricing has been pretty stable. So I would say what we're talking about here is probably the most rational of the markets. That said, all the players seem to have a bit more bounce in their step. And I think that it's a good caution that we should keep an eye out for changes in supply, in pricing and other things that might happen. Notice my own proclamations here, I'm not saying anything about that you're going to see real growth out of Capital One's Card business. We still have a conservative stance. We've got a lot of things running off. I'm very focused on generating resilient returns and letting the growth that the market has to give us, come to us in the way that it will. But we're going to keep a conservative stance on that.","Operator","We'll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Rich, could you possibly dimensionalize what you're seeing in the Auto business? You had mentioned that things are, in a sense, tightening up there. And I don't know if there's a way that you can describe how the ROAs are changing in the business or how you're seeing that shift, but that would be very helpful, that's my first question.","Richard D. Fairbank","Yes, Ken, the Auto business had a confluence of things happen to it that I believe in our lifetime is, you're never going to see again, okay, and in the period after the financial crisis. You had competitors head for the hill, more exiting in that space than in the other businesses that we play in. You had -- the car companies run into huge problems that cut back their supply. And you add the consumer -- even walk away from their homes while they're making sure that -- I mean, it seems like the assets that they were most making sure they paid on was their car. And you had an extraordinary sustained increase in used car prices that meant for all of us. Every year when we did our originations and for us, of course, assuming that whatever we saw in used car prices would regress toward the mean, the fact that we find, on the recovery side, so much more value than we had estimated, you really had kind of this -- kind of the Golden Age, if you will, of the Auto business. What's happening now is that other than the fact we don't yet see evidence of used car pricing subsiding, although we would expect that as well, you see pretty much more return to normal on all the things that I just talked about. People have reentered the space -- lenders have reentered the space. It's not lost in them that there was some gold in them there hills. The car companies are getting their mojo back and stepping up volumes quite a bit. And so -- we are very, very careful to watch these markets carefully and not pursue growth objectives at the sacrifice of good credit and all of that. So where are we? This is not a red flag that I'm dropping on this business. It's really more of a return from an exceptional, once-in-a-lifetime kind of period to something more normal. So from an underwriting point of view, if you talk about -- if you look at pricing in the prime space, pricing is now at prerecession levels. It's very competitive. In subprime, it's healthy but falling and approaching the -- approaching kind of more cycle average, but still above it. The -- from a credit point of view, the LTVs are stable and healthy. FICO Scores are holding pretty firm in the industry. But there is some lengthening of terms, significant growth in the sort of 73-month and beyond kind of term period. So we'll keep an eye on that. But of the various metrics to be loosened, that one is a lot less alarming to us. So what we see, Ken, is a business that at the margin, if I described it, I think, 'at the margin,' the originations we're doing now in prime are kind of pretty much typical for what you'd see through this cycle probably. In subprime, they're a bit above but they're clearly well-above hurdle but not at the exceptional levels that we saw in the past. And so there's still a comfortable margin in our originations relative to our cost of capital. And we are comfortable with the underwriting that we are doing. And so that's why at the pretty high level of originations we've been operating at, we hope to continue at levels pretty consistent with that. But the main thing that we wanted to do was flag that -- while at times, I will raise issues and say, \"watch out for these various concerns out there.\" These changes in the Auto business are -- it's absolute portfolio math as these new originations replace the old. So we still love the business and we're going to be very passionate in our pursuit of it. But there's going to be a little less gold in them there hills going forward.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I understand. And then as maybe an analogous event, in terms of what may happen, getting back to Don's question about competition, do you see that possibly that could happen within the U.S. Card business? Just this is obviously a point in time where the returns in the U.S. Card business are extremely high and, clearly, everybody's focused on it. I'm wondering if you are seeing any evidence of a shift, whether it be in the pricing or the underwriting that would suggest that we're maybe on the early stages of seeing something similar in U.S. Card.","Richard D. Fairbank","I think there's a real difference between the kind of exceptional -- the high returns in the Card business and the high returns in the Auto business. In the Auto business, when there's a gold rush like we've had in the past number of years, pretty much anybody out there can go out, partake in that and almost anybody could've made a lot of money doing that business. And you just need the right price for the right dealer at the right time. And you're pretty good to go. What makes the Card business exceptionally profitable on a sustainable basis is the nature of -- in an incredibly sophisticated business, the nature of these relationships that are not just some one-off origination, these are customers that you manage over time, and the industry is down to a handful of players who are deeply experienced in the business. Every one of those players just went through the Great Recession. Several of them lost billions of dollars in the business. Everybody, I think, saw the -- what happens to parts of their business when the stuff that they chased too aggressively. Ken, I'm more hopeful that the -- I think the Auto business -- the other thing is that the Auto business, I think, has gotten to a place where the cost to acquire is really pretty high. And so certainly, what we're doing is focusing mostly on profitability and taking what the market will give us. But I think the real difference versus what I've seen in Auto and especially what I see in the C&I business of people sort of rushing into these spaces because they don't really have a lot of other places to go.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Rich, you talked about $1.5 billion in marketing this year and you talked about having effective marketing use of that money to generate growth in some of the areas. As you kind of look at that and we think into 2014, are those opportunities getting better or worse? I mean, do you think that you're going to go for more growth in 2014 in those areas than you're seeing now or dial back in them in the Card business?","Richard D. Fairbank","Moshe, I think that we see, at the margin, a bit of increase in opportunities. I'm not sure that's really going to translate into an increase in marketing, because I think it may be that the things we've been investing in we see some pretty good results from and we would continue doing that. When -- so I believe that we already have good success in our business when you look past the things that we're running off. That's the result of many things, including our investment in marketing. I think we see continued success and you should probably expect continued investment in marketing. When people talk about growth, of course, growth is really driven by originations, account management and choices to runoff things. And so we've had a bit of this paradox that we're investing quite a bit in marketing at the same time that we're going sideways with respect to the portfolio. But again, we look at it down at the next level and really look at what is that marketing actually generating us. So I think more, we just see a validation of the success of our marketing but I'm not -- we're not really here to suggest any significant changes in that.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","As a follow-up, you identified the earnings contribution from the Best Buy portfolio. If you annualize that and kind of assume you buy back $1 billion worth of stock gets you about 2.5% of the shares, I mean, you annualize the Best Buy contributions $0.50 to $0.55 and 2.5% of the shares kind of benefits you by -- in the neighborhood of $0.15. Is that math about right, that cost about $0.40 a share?","Stephen S. Crawford","Yes, I'm not sure. Can you go through that again, please? As we've got -- we're going do the $1 billion repurchase, right? But that's all going to be back-end loaded in 2013. So you won't have -- you won't have the full impact of that until next year.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, right, I'm just thinking about it kind of both of them on a run rate basis, but you had kind of identified an impact of 120 some odd million dollars pretax positive from Best Buy. If you kind of annualize that, it's in the neighborhood $500 million or after-tax somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.50, $0.55, then kind of benefit from the other side of that from share repurchase.","Stephen S. Crawford","Moshe, I mean, that's actually one quarter of held-for-sale. Last quarter, we actually gave a schedule, quarter-by-quarter, of what happens with respect to Best Buy. And you really, for the run rate impact of Best Buy, need to look at the fourth quarter and even that, we suggested, wasn't going to be necessarily the final picture. Because we're still at work on the cost side. So this quarter, in terms of the impact, isn't really a good way to think about Best Buy on an annualized basis.","Operator","We'll go next to David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I'm wondering, could you just clarify for us how much of the sort of $73 million sequential reduction in reserves for estimated uncollectible finance charges and fees would have helped the margin, net interest income and how much would have been in fees?","Stephen S. Crawford","We couldn't hear you. Could you ask that question again?","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Yes, sure. I just wonder if you could give us the breakdown of the sequential decline in the uncollectible finance charges and fees? It was about $73 million lower in Q2. And I guess also I was curious about seasonality, because it's down a lot more from a year ago in the second quarter, it's been moving around as credit qualities improved.","Stephen S. Crawford",",","Wasn't the second quarter last year when we had the one-time increase in the finance charge and fee reserve from the acquisition of HSBC?","Richard D. Fairbank","That's correct. Right, right.","Stephen S. Crawford","So the decline is more the absence of that one-time effect.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. But sequentially, so from Q1 to Q2, it was about $73 million. Could you give us a sense of how much of that's in net interest income and how much is in noninterest income?","Richard D. Fairbank","No, we don't really break that out between noninterest income and net interest income, David, it's the sum of both. We don't have a quantification.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So I guess it's back to kind of trying to normalize the margin, if that's going to move around and that's even been kind of a benefit you have this quarter, which we expect that to be.","Stephen S. Crawford","Well, part of that is actually an impact of credit and part of it is just lower fees. So it's consistent with what you heard from Rich on the credit side. We're not anticipating huge improvements from here on out. So I think you'll probably see more of our stability on the item going forward.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from a Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Rich, I was hoping you could give us your current thoughts on where you see the rewards environment currently. And in particular, whether you're seeing any signs of industry rewards being scaled back a little bit given the focus on controlling expenses. And for Capital One specifically, what's been happening directionally with your rewards ratio?","Richard D. Fairbank","Bill, we have -- ours is more of a stable story in our case. We've been investing in this business for years. Our value proposition is pretty attractive for consumers and one of the key characteristics of what we offer is what you see is more what you get, there's not lots of fine print and complexity in terms of, ultimately, how much the customer gets. We're finding pretty high levels of redemption, which is consistent with customers really getting what they thought they would get. So we've been investing in this for years. We like what we see. And so for us, it's a very stable kind of story from here. I'm not seeing really much change from competitors on this dimension either. I mean, I think, frankly, it's a very competitive space and if people are looking for cost saves, I don't see our competitors really finding them in the reward space.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then finally, could you talk about -- in just looking at the reported 19% year-over-year increase in net interchange fee revenues this quarter, and then comparing that to the purchase volume growth, which for your Card business was up about 12% over the same period, I know there were some U.S. Card acquisition, there was an impact that, that had. But I guess I was just hoping you can maybe help us understand what the difference is between the growth rates and your net interchange fee revenues and your purchase volume growth, and that's it.","Richard D. Fairbank","Okay. Thanks, Bill. So the purchase volume grew, I think, 13% year-over-year or around 9% when you exclude the HSBC portfolio. And one thing that -- it always gets a little complicated on our net interchange disclosure, that represents all of our Card business, including International Credit Card and our Bank Debit business and the impacts of some partnership payments. So those payments, which are related to purchase activity. So if we separate out partner payments and focus on the trends in our domestic, general purpose credit card portfolio, our purchase volume growth has been higher, generally, over the last few years, higher than our net interchange revenue growth because we have been growing in the attractive products. We've been marketing, as you've seen them on TV and elsewhere. And the percentage of purchases in our card portfolio, driven by people with rewards cards as opposed to without rewards card, that has been a sustained mix change over time. That will continue over the course of the next year or so. We actually got to the -- these things bounce around a little bit, and we got -- in this particular quarter, when things net out, you actually had the interchange growth kind of on a net adjusted basis beyond the things I talked about, grow pretty much at the same level as purchase volume growth. But I think, over time, you will see some -- still some lagging of the interchange growth rate relative to the purchase volume growth rate only because we continue to migrate more of our portfolio to rewards, and so -- I mean, its the byproduct of actually a movement to bringing better products and experiences to our customers. Where we get rewarded with that over time, no pun intended, is with better customer experience, lower attrition and the more sustainable franchise metrics that are really what this journey is about. So -- but what I'm happy about is for some years, actually, the interchange was lagging the purchase volume growth by a lot and now the race has become much closer.","Jeff Norris","Okay. Thanks, Michael. Thank you, everybody, for joining us on the conference call today. And thank you for your interest in Capital One.
