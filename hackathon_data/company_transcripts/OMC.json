[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  At this time, I'd like to introduce you to today's conference call host, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Omnicom Group, Mr. Randall Weisenburger. Please go ahead.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our first quarter earnings call. We hope everyone's had a chance to review our earnings release. We have posted to our website both the press release and a presentation covering the information that we'll be presenting this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I've been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that's included at the end of the presentation. I'd like to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and that those statements are our present expectations and actual events or results may differ.  We also want to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.","Now we're going to begin the call with brief remarks from John Wren. Following John's remarks, we'll review our financial performance for the quarter, and then we'll open up the call for questions.","John D. Wren","Thank you for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to speak to you about our latest business results and the progress we're making against our key financial and strategic initiatives. 2013 is off to a good start. Organic growth was 2.9% for the quarter. Our margin performance and free cash flow were on plan.","On our year-end results call, I said we expected modest growth for 2013. Our expectations have not changed. Today, the global economy appears to be operating at 3 speeds. Asia and Latin America remain strong, the U.S. continues to experience slow but steady growth and the most challenging region continues to be the Eurozone. Against this backdrop, we have sharpened our focus on things we can control. We are working with our agencies in key markets to take advantage of growth opportunities as they arise, and our managers remain focused on controlling our cost structure.","I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing some of the strategies that are essential to our growth. First, acquiring and retaining the best talent; second, expanding our geographic footprint and service offerings to our clients; third, continuing to invest in our digital and analytical capabilities in all key markets around the world; and finally, delivering innovative and integrated solutions based on meaningful consumer insights.","Our ongoing investments in our recruitment initiatives, talent management and training programs are helping us increase the diversity and skills of the many talented individuals at our agencies. Across our organization, we are also focused on supporting our clients' efforts to grow their business in markets around the world. We are expanding our geographic footprint in rapidly growing economies in Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East through prudent acquisitions and focused organic investments.","Meeting our clients' needs is the first test for all our acquisitions and investments, followed by cultural fit and price. We remain steadfast in this approach. As the pace of innovation accelerates, new platforms are emerging on almost a daily basis. Experience tells us that these platforms will come and go in shorter and shorter cycles. We've adapted an open-source approach to partnering with media, data and research companies. This strategy allows us to employ the latest technologies, and at the same time, reduces our investments in or acquisitions of technology that may become outdated.","Another important benefit of this strategy is that many of these technologies are enabling us to capture, filter and analyze large amounts of data, transforming the way our agencies leverage information to drive business results for our clients. Annalect, our primary data and analytics business, is aggressively working with our agencies, clients and partners to collect data in real time and convert it into actionable consumer insights. Executing on our core strategies, investing in talent, digital and analytical capabilities, expanding our footprint and service capabilities and delivering actionable insights and integrated solutions will allow us to further excel in innovation, creativity and grow the company.","Now I'd like to turn my attention to the first quarter. As I mentioned, organic growth globally was up 2.9%. With the exception of the euro markets, all of our major regions experienced solid growth. By regions, the U.S. had 4.1% organic growth. We remain optimistic that the U.S. economy will continue to improve for the balance of the year. In Europe, the U.K. experienced organic growth of 2.3%. Euro markets had negative organic growth of 3.7%. Almost every year, a country is being impacted by the broad economic slump in the region. At this point, we expect volatility to continue, as France makes adjustments to reach budget objectives and Germany prepares for federal elections this September. Our European agencies outside the euro currency markets turned in positive results, as did our businesses in Asia and Latin America.  I will now turn the call back to Randy, who will take you through our numbers in more detail.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Thank you, John. Q1 was a good start to the new year. Revenue came in at just below $3.4 billion, which was an increase of 2.8%. Organic growth was at the high end of our expectations for this quarter at 2.9%. I'll address our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes.","EBITDA and operating income. Due to the continued efforts of our agency management teams in controlling our cost structures, EBITDA increased 2.7% to $397 million, and our EBITDA margin was 11.7%, which was in line with Q1 of last year. Operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased 2.5% to $372 million, and the resulting operating margin was 10.9%.","Slide 2 addresses the items below operating income. First, net interest expense for the quarter was $40.9 million, up $11.7 million from Q1 of last year, but up only $600,000 from Q4. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to interest expense on the $1.25 billion of 10-year notes we issued in Qs 2 and 3 of last year.","On the tax front, our reported rate for the quarter was 33%, up slightly from Q1 last year. As we mentioned during our call in February, resulting benefit from our Asia-Pac reorganization should bring our normal operating tax rate down to about 33.6% for the full year. Also this quarter, we had a couple of small onetime or discrete items that impacted the rate positively. Earnings from our affiliates increased to $3.2 million this quarter, and the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders and our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $1.7 million to $19.7 million, mainly as the result of the performance of our European operation. As a result of all of that, net income was $205 million for the quarter.","On Slide 3, we show the allocation of net income to common shareholders and to participating securities, which for us is our restricted stock. Year-over-year, the amount increased by $900,000. This chart also shows our diluted share count. As a result of our ongoing focus on returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases, our diluted share count for the quarter was down year-over-year about 5.2%. The combination of net income and reduced share count resulted in diluted EPS of $0.76 per share.","On the next few slides, we take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX, on a year-over-year basis, the dollar strengthened against the yen, British pound, real, the Aussie dollar and the rupee, and it weakened against the Euro, the RMB, the sing dollar and the yuan. The net result reduced our revenue for the quarter by 0.06%, or about $20 million. Looking ahead, if the FX rates stay at current levels, the impact on revenue will be negative about 20 basis points in Q2 and about the same amount for the full year.  Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue by $15.4 million in the quarter, or about 0.05%. Looking ahead, if we don't complete another acquisition, we would expect net acquisition revenue to remain marginally positive in Q2.","Now with regard to organic revenue growth, it was a very solid quarter, up 2.9%, or about $96 million. As I mentioned, the performance was at the high-end of our expectations coming into the quarter. I should also point out, but I believe most of you already know, we're up against pretty strong comps from the first half of last year, where we had over 5% organic growth each quarter.","Turning to our mix of business on Slide 5. Brand advertising accounted for 49% of our revenue and marketing services, 51%. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 6.1%, led by continuing strong performance in our media businesses, and our marketing services sector was up 0.01%. Within marketing services, CRM was down in the quarter. Strength in our field marketing businesses domestically, as well as in China, was offset in part by the performance of our events businesses, which last year benefited from Olympics-related activities.","Public relations was up 1.9%, reflecting improved performance in our markets outside of Europe and specialty communications was up 1% overall. While our recruiting businesses continue to be down, our health care businesses had a very solid quarter, driven by strong new business performance.","Turning to Slide 6. Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was split 53%, domestic; and 47%, international. In the United States, revenue increased $72 million, or 4.2%. Organic growth remained very strong at 4.1%, or $70 million, again, led this quarter by the strong performance of our media business, and acquisitions net of dispositions was marginally positive, adding $2.2 million.","International revenue increased $19 million, or 1.2%. As I mentioned, FX continued to have a negative impact, resulting in a decline of 1.2%, or about $20 million. Acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue by $13 million and organic growth, in aggregate, was positive $26 million, or 1.6%, but again, organic growth continues to be extremely mixed by market.","In our larger European markets, Russia, Turkey and the U.K. had positive performances. In the Eurozone, Spain continued to do well, while France and Germany were both down. In aggregate, the Euro countries were down 3.7%.  In Asia, we continue to have strong performances across the region, with China, Hong Kong, India, Japan and Singapore leading our effort, and in Latin America, our operation in Brazil continues to lead the region.","Slide 7 shows our mix of business by industry. On a percentage basis, there were no significant changes in our mix of business this quarter compared to Q1 of 2012. As for growth rates, we had good performances in consumer products, technology, pharma and T&E sectors. On the other side of the spectrum, financial services continues to be difficult.","Turning to Slide 8. Our cash performance in the quarter was in line with our expectations. We generated approximately $302 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital.","On Slide 9, you can see the breakdown of our primary uses of cash during the quarter. They included dividends paid to our minority interest shareholders of $23 million, capital expenditures of $38 million. Acquisitions, including earnout payments net of proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $17 million and share repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $238 million. As you may recall, we accelerated the payment of our Q4 dividend from early January to December. As a result, there was no dividend payment in Q1. So all in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $15 million in the quarter.","Slide 10 shows our current capital structure. Year-over-year, our total debt increased to $4.46 billion, almost entirely related to the $1.25 billion of 10-year senior notes we issued during Q2 and Q3 of 2012. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.37 billion, which was an increase of around $680 million from last year. The year-over-year increase was due to our share repurchase activity last year and an increase in working capital at the end of Q1, which was mostly the result of the quarter ending on the Easter holiday. As a result of the increased debt, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2.1x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1x. Our interest coverage ratio remains very strong at 11x.","On Slide 11, both our return on invested capital and return on equity continue to lead the industry and both increased further for the last 12 months. Our return on invested capital increased to 17.7% and our return on equity improved to almost 30%.","And finally, on Slide 12, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders. As you can see, for the period from 2002 to the just completed quarter, the cumulative return of cash to shareholders has now matched our cumulative net income for the same period at $9.3 billion. This is largely the result of our share repurchase activities. However, over the last couple of years, we've made a point to significantly increase our dividend payout ratio.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. There are several other supplemental slides included in the presentation, but at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of James Dix with Wedbush Securities.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Two questions. I guess, if you could give any comments on the changes at Chevrolet and then just looking beyond the auto category. How do you see the current environment in terms of opportunities to pick up large-scale new business? And then second, when it comes to application of data for your clients, has it generally been more about providing the same impact in terms of whatever KPIs are important for those clients at a lower cost? Or are you seeing opportunities to actually apply data to uncover new demand at a similar cost?","John D. Wren","With respect to Chevrolet, there are 2 components of it of the business that we have with them. One was the advertising business with Goodby Silverstein and the other was with another agency called 720. 720 continues its relationship with Chevy and Commonwealth, and for the quarter, there wasn't any impact at all. And most of the analytics that -- it's a very broad question. What we're able to do and increasingly able to do is do better targeting, grab better insights, and that's what most of the work has been focused on with respect to the majority of the work we're doing in that area.","Randall J. Weisenburger","New business -- big opportunities in new business come across periodically, and I think our agencies do very well at it. Where I think we really excel is, frankly, the day in and day out, it's agencies coming up with innovative solutions, innovative ways of bringing new ideas to the clients that continue to drive our growth and importance to the client and hopefully help drive the clients' results over time.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Just one follow-up. So I take it that the changes at Chevrolet have not had a material impact on your outlook for growth this year?","John D. Wren","No, nor could they.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","When you guys look at your U.S.-based multinational clients, have they been shifting money out of Europe maybe to faster-growing markets and generally keeping the budget intact? Or is Europe pressuring their global spend?","Randall J. Weisenburger","It's not something that we track quite that way. I would probably hypothesized that most companies have to manage their global P&L. So obviously, if people have difficulties in one market, no different than for us, with negative organic growth in Europe, it certainly puts pressure on the company globally because, again, we're reporting one set of numbers. We're breaking the numbers out, but the aggregate performance is what counts.","John D. Wren","And I might add that, and this is not necessarily responsive to the question you had asked, but Europe is still a big market. There's still a lot of that activity that goes on in Europe, and it's going to continue. It's not growing at the moment, but the growth is marginal when you compare it to the base.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And also, Randy, auto has been a strong category for you, at least through the last 12 months before the March quarter. Is the weakness primarily from Europe or is growth just normalizing there?","Randall J. Weisenburger","We basically had a flat quarter in auto, and it will be consistent. I always told people you shouldn't look at one quarter's numbers, especially when you break it down into small segments. It could be timing. It could be a lot of things that are impacting the number, and again, the numbers -- flat isn't -- it's not stellar. It's not -- we're not looking for flat numbers, but flat is not bad.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research.","Craig Huber","I've got a couple of housekeeping questions first. I mean, typically, you'll talk about your new client billings for the quarter. I guess your normal goal was about $1 billion on net basis. How did that performed in the quarter? And I also wanted to ask, can you break apart your salary and service cost line versus your office and general expense line, please?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes. So net new business was just over $1 billion. So it wasn't a stellar quarter, but it was a solid quarter. So I said a lot of that's made up of a large number of small wins and expansions with clients. And the breakout of salary and service and office in general, salary and service was $2,533,600,000 and office, in general, was $493,600,000.","Craig Huber","And then also, John or Randy, your expectation for modest organic growth this year, just to sort of parse those at you, is that sort of like 3% to 3.5% growth you're sort of expecting for this year?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes, it wasn't a guidance, but the discussion we had at the end of the year and last quarter was we expect -- we felt -- we think this year kind of feels like 2012, except for the Olympics. And we thought the Olympics probably added maybe 1\/2 to 3\/4 of a point. So if that works out exactly, that will be sort of in that 3% to 3.5% range.","Craig Huber","And then lastly, if I could, when you think about the outlook here for the remaining part of the year for your euro-denominated markets, is your sense that things are getting a little bit worse there, a little bit better? What's your sort of sense there for sort of what's your expectation what happened here in the last quarter?","John D. Wren","I think Europe's going through a difficult time, and I think everybody, and it's been discussed at length, the troubles that Southern Europe's having. Our business is stabilized, I would say, in the south. And now what we saw in the first quarter was setbacks in France and in Germany, which are bigger markets for us, but not overwhelmingly large. And in addition to the concern that's in Europe, you have France trying to meet its budget objectives, and you have the Germans preparing for federal elections in September, and they are the banker to Europe, so there's a bit of conservatism there. So it can improve. I know in the future, it will improve. I don't know how fast. I don't know if it's going to happen within the next 2 quarters or in the next year, but you have a sense that they'll work their way through it.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Any color you can give us on how you're doing in terms of protecting profitability in the euro market, given the weakness there? I know it's not an easy market to necessarily make short-term cuts in. And then just following up on your comment about the softness in CRM in the quarter being from the difficult comps in the event business, can you remind us how long those comps last or should we see better numbers maybe in Q2?","Randall J. Weisenburger","The tough comps on some of the CRM businesses really runs through the first half, probably even a little bit more in the second quarter than the first quarter. As far as margins in Europe go, it's very difficult to manage margins. I think our agencies are doing a good job. They have to continue to do a good job. Certainly, in a negative organic growth rate environment is extremely difficult for service companies to hold their margins. Again, our agencies have, I think, done fairly well, but they need to stay focused even though it's tough.","Operator","You have a question from the line of Matt Chesler with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question I have, John and Randy, we all sort of hang on every single word of yours on these conference calls, including the tone. And as I remember, at the beginning of the year when you spoke in an Investor Conference, the market read some of your comments as having an improved tone over what you had said at the end of the fourth quarter. Now I know you're not changing your non-guidance for the full year organic growth, but are you feeling any differently about your outlook, which includes modest growth now relative to what you felt just couple of months ago? And then I have a couple of questions.","John D. Wren","In the first instance, I'm impressed. My wife doesn't listen to me as closely as you do. We see what you're seeing in the newspapers. It's present. There are difficulties around the world when you look at 90-day chunks of time. It's difficult to -- I don't see anything breaking out or -- to significantly change that short-term view. It's important for us because not only are we managing the upside because we have a pretty good track record of taking advantage of opportunities as they present themselves, but setting the tone for our 70,000-odd people in making certain that they have reasonable expectations and, as Randy suggested a few minutes ago, continue to be vigilant about the cost that they have. When you look further out past this year, I am more hopeful that we're going to have steady progress, and it's going to lead to increased growth over time.","Randall J. Weisenburger","And in case it's different or in case I sound different, my tone is basically it's intended to be the same. There are a lot of really good things going on around Omnicom. There's some great innovative ideas that different of our agencies are executing against, utilizing new technologies and new mediums that I find extremely interesting and exciting and I think that it's fun to be around, seeing that level of innovation, I'll say. There's some definitely difficult economic environment and it's our third or fourth year of that, which is very difficult. It's much more fun to manage service businesses with a 7% or 8% or even a 4% or 5% GDP growth environment, pretty consistent in every market around the world. We don't have that. We knew that coming in. We haven't had it for the last 2 years. Those agencies have to manage. The good news is, I think, with the innovation that our agencies have, they're finding ways of growing their businesses and expanding, which does make it enjoyable to be around.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then the quick follow-up would just be around gross buybacks. You've provided the net number. Can you give us the gross number on the call?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes, we're going to have to look for that one though for a minute. Why don't I -- why don't we go on to the next question and I'll -- well, hold on, maybe we've got it. It's faster than I expected. Gross buybacks were 4,992,000-some-odd shares.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sorry, 4,992,000, okay, average price or dollar amount?","Randall J. Weisenburger","4,992,000 shares. It will take me a second to give you the dollar amount.","John D. Wren","Okay.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Oh, what's the average share price? Let me just do it off that.","$273.5 million.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","I have one company specific question and one industry question, please. First of all, sorry to dig up something that has come up many times in the past, but just noticing a couple of puts on converts coming up in June and July. Any commentary on your approach to those? And industry-wise, I just wonder if you can talk a minute about media measurement. There's been a lot of discussion lately about possible changes to the TV rating system that Nielsen runs. There is a lot of things going on with online ratings, perhaps contrasting with all of the data that Google or Facebook, whoever else maybe able to provide. And I just wonder if you could talk generally about your view on media measurement and how it affects your businesses, please.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I'll give -- let me first answer the converts. So the converts have been good securities for us that we like. We'll go through, like we do each time, a put or a call period comes up, and evaluate them and make what we think is the right economic decision. I haven't done that yet for this one, for this put date that's coming up, but again, the converts have been good securities for us for a long period of time. I'll let John comment on the media measurement. I'll give you the backdrop, though, that I always give everybody. Media's very important piece of our business. It's about 12% of our revenue, in aggregate, globally. I think our firms are extremely bright and on top of all the changes and will certainly adjust whatever is necessary in their business and utilize all of the measurements and technology capabilities and changes that occur. So I can't really believe a change one way or the other is going to affect their overall business as it affects us in any significant way.","John D. Wren","And what I'd add to that is that the environment is fluid. The conversation is -- and there's quite a bit of conversation about changes in measurement and also more -- some of the methodologies which are being brought into the marketplace to measure social and other types of contact with consumers. I feel a little funny because at 6:00 last night, I was about to sit down and be brief for a different reason on this, brought completely up to date on this topic and I had to cut the meeting short. So I'd have to defer really to my media experts and they're not present this morning. We'll find out and come back to you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First of all, if you look back over the last couple of years, pretty much industry-wide, the BRIC markets and some of the other large emerging markets have put up organic growth in the double-digit range. I think investors generally believe that we've obviously got strong nominal GDP growth, but the other kicker in there has been that marketing as a percent of GDP has been increasing. Wonder if you could offer a view on whether you think that trend is likely to continue, particularly in the bigger markets, the BRIC markets? Or whether we might see a maturing, if you will, and perhaps a slacking of growth there to a level that more closely resembles nominal GDP? And then secondly, a housekeeping question, I wonder if you could tell us the level of severance expense in this quarter versus first quarter of last year?","John D. Wren","Sure. Again, I might -- sorry to -- somebody's not in the room. I'm not -- the growth has been great in the BRIC markets, and it continues to be strong. I have never placed the same reliance on statistics coming from those markets as I have in the more developed markets. So I'm not sure we're comparing apples to apples. I think you can see and watch GDP-reported numbers and other types of information, whereas the car sales were down 10% across Europe and they're building new car plants in China. So there's a lot of tangible real evidence, but I haven't found statistics that I would run the business off of.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes, I think there's -- if you agree with some of the general theories, marketing is really tied to discretionary GDP, and I think in high-growth markets, discretionary GDP -- some of those BRIC markets, discretionary GDP, as a percentage of GDP, is increasing. I think marketing will be more closely tied to that. Our business in many of those markets is more highly tied today to, I'll say, nonlocal clients, so large multinational clients trying to establish their presence. They are probably investment spending there to build their market positions, which will benefit us as well. And the third comment, because everyone always uses BRICs, my personal view, Brazil is a very sophisticated marketing market already.","John D. Wren","As is China.","Randall J. Weisenburger","And I'm not quite sure I would put it in sort of the same category as some of the other emerging markets just because it's as sophisticated as it already is. To flip and answer your severance question, it's -- severance this quarter was about $17 million, down about $1 million or so year-over-year.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Robert Fishman with Nomura.","Robert Fishman - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","If I could just follow-up on the rest of the world on the revenue question. Are there any particular territories that are dragging down the growth from that historical double-digit range to this mid-single digits? Or should we think about this as kind of the new run rate going forward?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I'm not sure that I understand the question.","Robert Fishman - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So historically, the rest of the world has been growing in the double-digit range. Now we've had 2 consecutive quarters of mid-single-digit growth, so I'm just kind of curious if there's any particular territory that's part of -- that makes up the rest of the world. We talked about the BRICs, Brazil, is there any particular territory that's dragging down that growth? Or is it just kind of the new run rate going forward?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I have to say off the top of my head, I don't know how -- I don't know how to answer to your question. Why don't I think about it a little bit? I'm going to have to probably -- I'll call you back after I've had a chance to go through the numbers, and see if I -- I think there's something that would allow me to answer the question better.","Robert Fishman - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And can I just maybe ask one more on the cost side? So with the cost savings going on in office and general line, is that the right way to think about the rest of the year there, to help offset the increases in the salary expenses?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Some of that is timing. We certainly have a large number of programs going on to try to drive even further our efficiency in real estate occupancy and basically controllable costs. So hopefully, we'll continue to make progress on that line. We also want to make progress on the salary and service line obviously.","Operator","We have a question from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions. The first one is managing around Europe, which I think you guys are doing pretty well, sounds like a real -- the biggest overhang you have for potential margin expansion in '13 and, frankly,  maybe for '14. So what kind of normalized growth out of Europe do you think you need to see before the operating leverage toggle, switches back to where you can get some more operating leverage? And then the second question is, I guess, in the hanging-on-your-every-word category, Randy, I can't remember an earnings call where new business wasn't about $1 billion, and it actually kind of sounds like this quarter, but actually, I think one of the things you said was that you didn't think it was stellar. And given that it's not that different from the typical quarter, I think, I was just kind of looking for a little more color around that comment.","Randall J. Weisenburger","We certainly have some quarters where it's $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion. Generally, the way that the new business works, and keep in mind we have a large number of agencies and a large number of markets, and we're also a U.S.-centric and we hear about these big wins and losses, which you can get in a market like the United States, you can get when you have a global account and you get when it tends to be either the media headlines or obviously big numbers because it's big billings, and the creative accounts, the annual retainer-fee-type wins. Well, that's great, but PR wins, some of the event wins in -- especially in smaller markets a lot of those aren't even 7 figures, but there's a large number, and we have a large number of agencies and I used to describe it sort of as 3 yards and a cloud of dust. We have a lot of people doing great jobs, getting what appear to be relatively small assignments, but they are very important, meaningful assignments, especially in their markets and for their agencies. And so that 40- or 50-page list of net new business wins tends to be in the $600 million to $800 million range almost every quarter. That's because we get a large number of people out working pretty hard. And you end up getting a handful of bigger wins or -- and\/or losses in the quarter that move the needle, that can move the needle more significantly. If you get a $300 million or $400 million win in a quarter, it obviously goes a long way. It takes a large number of those 6-figure wins to make up for that one $300 million or $400 million win or loss. So that's what tends to move the needle around. We would kind of expect, given our size of business, for the number to be around $1 billion and a better economic environment, probably more around $1.2 billion or so in a more positive economic time frame. And when that big win or loss comes around, the number gets up quite -- can get up quite a bit higher, but again, it's [indiscernible].","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So what was missing then was like some of the high-profile big wins or losses?","Randall J. Weisenburger","There wasn't a real big -- there weren't any real big wins and losses that I can think of in the quarter.","Operator","You have a question from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","John, you said in your opening remarks, you talked about sort of an open-platform approach to technology, and I think you said that you'd book to not acquire as many assets, but more partner with media tech, data firms. And I remember a few years ago, you guys announced a pretty big Google partnership that was maybe a step in this direction or maybe a different direction, but could you maybe add a little more color to that comment and how that might differentiate Omnicom with some of the other big holding company is it tend to be, I think, more acquisitive on the technology side, data side? And correct me if you think that's wrong, and whether that's -- this strategy, you think, pays off in terms of growth or returns or profitability for Omnicom that investors might see over time?","John D. Wren","Sure. I can't -- starting with part of your question, I can't give you the strategies of my competitors because I can only observe them as you do. But philosophically, when a new platform is introduced, we're most interested initially in the learnings that come from it and whether or not it's applicable or is going to make our insights about consumers better or drive more sales on behalf of our clients. A very long, long, long time ago, when the Internet was first introduced, we had a view that, gee, if we bought 20% or 30% of any and every company, it would be a wonderful thing because we'd have a seat at the table and learn more than the rest of the marketplace. Over time, we decided that some of those investments are really good. Some of them weren't. We didn't necessarily learn anymore than anyone else because those companies had the mission of trying to grow themselves, and they'd sell and disperse their information to whomever would be willing to buy it. So we decided to get out of the investment business and stay focused on trying to invest in companies that we believe have a long-term purpose in this ever-changing and more rapidly changing process. Because we're as big as we are, everyone comes knocking on our door so we have access to look at, and often times, access to do 1 or 2 things, either partner with to make sure that what we believe the individual company will do will in fact turn out to be successful or we have the ability to make an investment in it. We've elected to deal with quite a number of different platforms, not make a judgment as to whether or not it was a good financial investment because our primary interest is to service our clients. Where we do develop long-term relationships and we do see a particular service being part of the immediate future, we would, in fact, sit down and make an investment, but we just don't run it -- we stay focused on what we're good at. We don't try to get into the venture capital business, I guess. Probably, you can add whatever you like, Randy.","Randall J. Weisenburger","No, I think that summed it up. We want to partner with the best technologies that are out there to bring those technologies with our insights and, I'll say, marketing insights, consumer insights and service capabilities to our clients. Today, there's a large number of technologies being developed for relatively narrow purposes. We obviously have a large number of clients with lots of different objectives. We want to bring the right technology to bear for the right client at the right time. We don't necessarily need to own the tech to do that. We need to know how to utilize the tech for our clients' advantage.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And if I could maybe squeeze one more in, Randy. The year is off to a decent start. I know you didn't change your sort of full year outlook, but would you be willing to give us a sense for how much sort of additional revenue growth would then lead to a change in your margin expectations? I think they're flat year-over-year for the year, I mean, would 100, 150 basis points of improvement sort of move the needle for you guys? Or do you think that you've sort of -- you've capped the margin outlook in the right balance?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think for right now, we're pretty happy with our margin performance and the, I'll say, a current year objective of flat margins in the current economic environment. So I mean, your question was how much improvement. If it was the right improvement and the right locations, I could see margins expanding. But as I mentioned before, it's very difficult to manage margins in a negative organic growth environment like it's around Europe, and, frankly, the volatility of organic growth is what's difficult. If we had uniform 3% organic growth across every agency around Omnicom, frankly, that would be an easier environment than now, where we have agencies with high organic growth rates, and, frankly, at times that becomes difficult to manage their margins too because it's been a probably high-cost or rising-cost economic environment, as well as the places where it's negative or more difficult economic growth.","John D. Wren","I think the only thing that I would add, especially this morning, having learned that everybody listens to every one of our words, is what Randy said is absolutely spot on. But in the answer, don't interpret it to be that we're satisfied with our margins, we're not. We're constantly going agency by agency, region by region to find out, re-examine the way we're doing business, to find out whether or not there's a more efficient way to do business. So the quest has not stopped, even though your question had more to do with guidance, I think.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes, and, frankly, to go on John's point, our agencies have to do a very significant amount of work each year to continuously find efficiencies in order to hold their margins, let alone improve their margins.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","My question's more of industry orientation as well and a bit more of a mid- to longer-term view. On 2 verticals, on auto, where we're past the domestic bankruptcies now, that first wave of new model launches and sort of settling in, but still working back to sort of prerecession levels of spending. I'd be interested to see how you expect that industry to work through over the next couple of years. And then secondly, the health care vertical, where I know we've been talking a lot in past quarters about some big drugs coming off patent, and maybe where you see the pipeline coming in and potentially that vertical coming back a bit more aggressively in the next few years.","John D. Wren","The U.S. auto companies, our auto numbers are global auto numbers, to begin with. So we see the U.S. increasingly moving back to what was normal prior to the bankruptcies, as you say, and the setbacks, and the products improving that are being produced by the domestic auto players.","Randall J. Weisenburger","And we're pretty fortunate in the auto category. We got a -- we have a broad range of services. We have sort of multi-disciplined global clients. We have 3 extremely strong clients that are right now growing share on a global basis. So that certainly benefits us, and we have a broad range of services, other services that we provide in the auto category to various companies around the world. So we're not -- it's not just a U.S. question or a European question. Over the last 4 or 5 years, we've found our auto revenues to be pretty logically aligned with global unit sales. So it's a category that has been pretty rational. Health care lately, our agencies have actually picked up and we had a pretty good quarter this quarter overall in health care. It's hard for me to segment right now, quite this fast in the quarter, whether or not that's new business performance or industry performance. I have a feeling that it's our new business and agency performance as opposed to overall category performance.","John D. Wren","And just one final point to do with Omnicom. In terms of servicing major automakers, our limitation is more on the side of the number of agencies that we have that already have a car account. And we were at 100% capacity until recently, when Goodby ended its relationship with General Motors. On one side, that's a bad thing. On the other side, I have great confidence that it won't be too long before Goodby gets another major car account. So this quarter, it's troubled. Three quarters from now, it will be an opportunity for us, the way I view it, because that's been the experience that I've had in dealing with the agencies that we represent, so...","Randall J. Weisenburger","Okay, I think we're probably at or past 9:30. So first, thank you all very much for taking the time to listen to our call, and we'll be -- Shub [ph] or I or whoever will be happy to answer any questions if you still have some. Thank you again.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to introduce you to your host for today's conference, Vice President of Investor Relations, Shub Mukherjee. Please go ahead.","Shub Mukherjee","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. On the call with me today is John Wren, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Phil Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer.","We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release we have posted on our Web site, www.omnicomgroup.com, this morning's press release along with the presentation covering the information that we will review this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our Web site.","Before we start, I've been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation, and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and that these statements are our present expectation and that actual events or results may differ materially.","I'd also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we'll discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. You will find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.","We are going to begin this morning's call with an overview of our business from John Wren. Then, Phil Angelastro will provide our financial results for the quarter, and then we will open-up the line for your questions.","John Wren","Thank you, Shub. Good morning. I\u2019m pleased to speak to you this morning about our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results. 2017 was an eventful year for the marketing and advertising industry. Many of the world's largest marketers and best known brands continue to undergo major changes driven by advances in technology, new disruptive competitors and changing consumer behavior. The breath and rate of change has CEOs and CMOs focused on the ability of their marketing organizations to keep pace and that is presenting opportunities and challenges for our agencies.","During my remarks, I will discuss how we are continuing to develop and execute on our strategies, including changes in our organizational structure, an additional service capabilities to provide our clients with communication solutions that address their overall business challenges.","Before I do that, I will review our fourth quarter and 2017 results. I do want to point out that while the 2017 Tax Act resulted in a charge in the fourth quarter, Phil will cover this in his remarks. Moving forward, into 2018, lower U.S tax rates will have a direct positive impact on Omnicom and many of our clients. I\u2019m pleased to report we achieved our internal organic growth and margin targets for the full-year of 2017.","Organic growth for the year was 3% at the low-end of our target. For the fourth quarter, organic growth was below our expectations at 1.6%. As I mentioned on our third quarter call, there's quite a bit of project work that occurs in the fourth quarter that impacts revenue. Client spending on these projects is typically concentrated in the U.S and is based on the individual client circumstances and general economic conditions.","In the fourth quarter 2017, our agencies only saw a partial benefit from this year-end project spend, which has historically been in the range of $200 million to $250 million. Looking towards 2018, the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and the stimulus from the recent budget deal should have a positive impact on consumer spending in the United States. We're optimistic we will see some of those benefits in the second half of 2018. Outside the U.S., the global economy appears to be in the best shape since the great recession.","Our fourth quarter organic growth of 1.6% varied across geographies and disciplines. North America organic revenue was down slightly less than 1%. Advertising and media was up 1.2% for the quarter, weighted down by lackluster performance in North America. In the U.S., several of our ad agencies and in particular our independent brands experienced client losses earlier in 2017 that are still cycling through and will continue to do so in the first part of 2018.","In 2017, we continue to move of our programmatic businesses upstream, so it is better aligned with our clients media strategies. As a result, Accuen is now an integrated offering within Omnicom's media agencies OMD, PHD and Hearts & Science. This realignment has changed the way we do business with many clients adopting a traditional approach, which has had a negative impact on our revenue growth in the U.S. The shift has not any significant impact on profitability from these activities and we expect this trend to continue into 2018.","To better capture the expanded scope of our services, we've broken our CRM into two categories, consumer experience and execution and support. Each CRM category grew 3.4% in the quarter. CRM consumer experience includes direct marketing, events, entertainment and sports, consulting and branding, and shopper marketing.","Events, entertainment and sports performed well in the quarter. Our branding business in the U.S., which had been a drag on growth earlier in 2017 began to stabilize. CRM execution and support includes our field marketing, merchandising and point-of-sale, not-for-profit research, sales support and custom communication services.","Our PR business was slightly positive in the quarter weighted down by results in the U.S where we have recently taken steps to turn around the performance of our operations. Also in the fourth quarter of 2016, we benefited from the U.S election-year spend that did not reoccur in 2017. For 2018, we expect political spending will increase for the midterm elections.","Our healthcare business, which is largely based in North America, was down 1.9% in the fourth quarter. Looking at our markets outside North America, a very solid fourth-quarter growth of 4.9%. The U.K was down 0.007% in the quarter. Our PR business in the U.K performed very strongly and media also had solid results, offsetting this performance were declines in brand advertising and field marketing.","Our Euro and non-Euro region was very strong at 8.2%. Germany and France were in the low single digits and the Netherlands, Spain, and Russia had double-digit growth. In the Asia-Pacific, fourth quarter organic growth was 6%. Australia and Singapore were in solid double digits, while Japan was slightly negative for the quarter. Latin America was down 0.003% in the quarter. Positive results in Mexico and Colombia were more than offset by continuing negative performance in Brazil.","EBITDA margin for the quarter was up 60 basis points over the last year to 15.5%. For the year, our margins increased 40 basis points to 14.2%. Before the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, net income for the quarter was $360 million and EPS increased 5.4% to $1.55 per share compared to the same period in 2016.","For the full-year 2017, we generated over $1.6 billion in free cash flow and returned almost $1.1 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In October, we increased our quarterly dividend by 9% to $0.60 per share.","Looking forward including benefit of lower U.S taxes, we expect our 2018 effective tax rate to decline by 350 to 450 basis points. Phil will provide more color on the impact of the U.S tax law changes on our 2018 effective tax rate during his remarks. Finally, our practice for the use of free cash flow remains unchanged. Dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases, as does our commitment to a strong balance sheet and maintaining our investment-grade rating.","These result serve as a testament to the consistency and diversity of our operation, our strong competitive position across advertising and marketing disciplines and geographic markets, and our ability to adapt our services and expand our capabilities to serve changing client needs in areas such as digital media, data and analytics.","Let me now turn to our client wins, strategic initiatives, and operational achievements for 2017, as well as our plans for 2018. While the first nine months of 2017 saw less new business activity than the same period in 2016. The fourth quarter was a very busy end to the year. We continue to grow our business with our major long-term clients as well as with new business.","Let me just mention a few of our wins across the globe. HP's personal systems group chose to consolidate its global creative media and analytics with Omnicom. Consistent with HP's platform we formed an integrated agency that houses talent from nine Omnicom agencies located in San Francisco with data and analytics as its core it is a client tailored approach that matches HP's position as a premium brand that is constantly innovating for its customers.","In addition through We Are Unlimited, Omnicom's agencies continued to expand our relationship with McDonald's. In the U.S., Zimmerman became a certified local dealer agency and hit the ground running by being selected by several co-ops and RAPP has been appointed as the lead CRM agency in the U.S. The combination of TBWA and Hearts & Science captured QuickBooks assignment from Intuit in November.","In December, State Farm consolidated most of their business with Omnicom. This includes the existing advertising, media, promotional and experiential businesses along with new assignments for direct marketing, multicultural and music. The consolidated leadership of this business will be based at DDB Chicago. Also in December, Omnicom's Health Group was chosen as the partner for a major pharmaceutical company with an extensive oncology portfolio.","I want to emphasize that most of these wins are direct result of the organizational changes and strategic investments we\u2019ve made over the past couple of years at Omnicom. As you know we\u2019ve simplified our service offerings through our matrix organizational approach with our global client leader group and the establishment of practice areas. We've also made and expect to continue to make further investments in people and in our digital data and analytical capabilities.","Simply put, our clients understand the advantages of an agency model that puts the consumer at the center and is agile across disciplines. Based on the success under the leadership of Peter Sherman, we continue to expand the number of clients in the global client leaders group with a focus on our top hundred clients. In line with this expansion, we've recently hired a Chief Talent Officer, Torrey La Grange, who will support and build on the talent within the global leaders group.","We also continue to establish practice areas. They\u2019re now in place for CRM experiential, healthcare, national brand advertising and PR. Planning is underway for a few more areas and that process should be completed by midyear. Our practice area and key client matrix structure is creating benefits through better sharing of expertise and knowledge, creating more career opportunities for our people, strengthening our new business development efforts, and leveraging our internal investments and identifying acquisition opportunities.","As an example of sharing of expertise and knowledge, Omnicom Health Group in partnership with Hearts & Science has created a data driven media offering that integrates market access data to help clients better invest their media dollars by reaching patients with more relevant messages. We started Omnicom Precision Marketing group for exactly what its name implies, to help clients get the right message to the right person at the right time on the right platform and in the right context.","Building on that goal, we recently combined best practices and tools across all of our data, intelligent and activation disciplines. The demands of clients, consumers and new technologies are pushing agencies to work faster and the way we organize ourselves is helping us to be more agile and responsive so that we can adjust quickly as our clients' needs change.","As always, we continue to make selective investments, partnerships and acquisitions that expand our capabilities and geographic presence. On the acquisition front, Omnicom Health Group recently acquired Snow Companies, based in Virginia, the agency specializes in direct to patient communications and research for major pharmaceutical and biotech companies around the world.","Turning to our operational initiatives. We remain focused on delivering efficiencies across the group. We are constantly challenging our people to find ways to manage their costs agency by agency. On a regional and global basis, we're making good progress on our real estate, information technology, back office, accounting services and procurement initiatives. These initiatives which are complex and take multiple years to execute will continue in 2018.","Our strategic goals for 2018 remain consistent. We will continue to hire and develop the best talents in the industry. We will be relentless in pursuing organic growth in servicing and expanding our offering to our existing clients and winning new business.","We will continue to pursue high-growth areas in opportunities through internal investments and acquisitions, and we will remain vigilant on driving efficiencies throughout our organization, increasing EBITDA and shareholder value. On the talent front, our commitment to hiring and developing the best people is unwavering. At Omnicom and our agencies, we strive to make our organization a place where people can build their careers.","We also place considerable effort on succession planning, advancement and diversity. A good example is the recent appointment of Wendy Clark as the new CEO of DDB Worldwide. Wendy joined DDB in 2016 and is passionate about our business and clients. Under her leadership the agency has grown by expanding existing relationships with State Farm, Mars, and McDonald's, and by winning new business. Chuck Brymer will remain with DDB as Chairman and will be assuming additional responsibilities when we announce the expansion of our practice areas later in the year.","On January 1, Barri Rafferty became CEO of Ketchum, making her the first woman CEO to lead a top five global PR agency. Throughout her tenure at Ketchum, Barri has areas held a number of strategic roles across the business. Most recently she was global President and CEO of North America.","As I stated before, our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce starts at the top. 2018 will see the completion of our Board refreshment program and we expect that following our May shareholders meeting, our Board will have a 11 members, including six women and four African-Americans.","Omniwomen continues to grow organically around the globe, leading up to International Women's Day on March 7. We plan to launch at least three new chapters in San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. OPEN Pride, our employee resource group dedicated to Omnicom's LGBTQ community launched global chapters in Hong Kong, London, Manila, New York City, Mumbai, and Shanghai. It is the depth and diversity of our talent that allows us to continue to win more than our fair share of industry awards.","There a few of the highlights from the fourth quarter. BBDO topped the Gunn Report as the most creative network for the 12th year in a row. Omnicom ranked the number one holding company. For the fourth consecutive year, Campaign Magazine named Adam & Eve DDB as agency of the year. At the festival of media in North America awards, Omnicom Media Group was media group of the year, PHD was named Agency Network of the Year, Touche! PHD Canada was awarded Agency of the Year.","At the Campaign Asia-Pacific agency of the year awards, TBWA and BBDO won creative and digital agency of the year in Hong Kong, Korea, Philippines, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, and China. I want to recognize and thank the people at our agencies for their world-class integrated campaigns, outstanding new business wins, and the great work that enabled us to deliver these results. In closing, we're pleased that our financial performance continues to reflect the excellence of our people and agencies.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at fourth quarter and the full-year results.","Philip Angelastro","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, 2017 proved to be challenging for our industry. Organic growth was 1.6% for the fourth quarter, below our expectations. While for the full-year, organic growth was 3% at the bottom of our range of expectations for the year.","As for FX, due to the weakening of the U.S dollar during the second half of the year, the impact of changes in currency rates increased our fourth quarter reported revenue by $102 million or 2.4%. We also continue to see the impact of the dispositions over the past year of several of our businesses that did not fit our long-term strategies.","These included the disposition in the second quarter of 2017 of Novus, our specialty print media business as well as some other agencies within our field marketing and events disciplines. These dispositions net of our recent acquisitions reduced our fourth quarter revenue by $235 million or 5.5%. I will go into further detail regarding our revenue growth later in my remarks.","Turning to the income statement items below revenue, operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased 3.0% to $620 million. With operating margin improving to 14.8% or 60 basis point improvement versus Q4 of last year. Our Q4 EBITDA increased 2.5% to $647 million and the resulting EBITDA margin of 15.5% also represented a 60 basis point increase over Q4 of last year.","The improvement in both our operating income and in our margins continues to primarily be driven on our ongoing companywide internal initiatives to increase efficiencies, particularly in our back office operations. Net interest expense for the quarter was $43.6 million, down $2.8 million versus the third quarter of 2017 and up $3.4 million versus Q4 of 2016.","Gross interest expense in the fourth quarter was down approximately $3.6 million compared to the third quarter, driven by a reduction in our commercial paper activity during the fourth quarter, partially offset by slight decrease in the benefit from our fixed to floating interest rate swaps. The short-term interest rates continue to rise. We'll continue to see a decrease in the benefit to interest expense from these swaps.","Interest income was also down slightly in the fourth quarter when compared to Q3. Compared to Q4 of last year, increasing gross interest expense of $3.1 million is primarily due to the increase in the interest rates on our commercial paper facility, as well as the reduced benefit from our interest rate swaps due to the increase in short-term interest rates versus a year-ago.","Turning to tax expense, in the fourth quarter we're required to record the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 add on our prior period tax position. The impact of the new low require the recognition of a one-time transition tax or total charge on our cumulative foreign earnings that were not previously subject to U.S taxes. This was partially offset by a net benefit from the adjustment of our existing deferred and another tax balances to reflect the new lower federal statutory tax rate of 21%.","As a result, we recorded a net increase to income tax expense of $106.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. The impact of the Tax Act will require ongoing analysis, and we expect this estimate to change as further information becomes available during 2018. Including the additional income tax expense recorded, our effective tax rate for Q4 was 50.2%.Excluding the additional expense, the effective tax rate was approximately 32%, which was a bit lower than the priors rate of 32.5%.","On Slide 3, we provide a detail on how the Tax Act impacted our income tax expense, net income, and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full-year, our effective tax rate increased to 36.9% compared to 32.6% for 2016. The year-over-year increase in the rate attributable to the Tax Act was partially offset by the recognition of an additional tax benefit from share-based compensation of $20.8 million.","The majority of which was recorded in Q1 resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09. This benefit arises from the difference between the book tax expense and the cash tax deduction recorded on our tax return from share-based compensation, which at the beginning of 2017 was required to be recognized in income tax expense. In 2016 and prior, that difference was recorded directly to equity and not the P&L. The standard required prospective recognition and does not allow restatement of prior periods.","Without the effect of the Tax Act and the change in accounting for share-based compensation, our full-year expected tax rate for 2017 would have been 32.4%. As for our projection of our tax rate going forward, we\u2019re still in the process of evaluating the impact of the Tax Act on our annual effective tax rate for 2018. However, based on current estimates, we expect the pro forma impact of the Tax Act to reduce our effective tax rate by about 3.5% to 4.5%.","Using our 2017 pre-tax income amount of approximately $1.9 billion, this would result in a pro forma reduction of income tax expense of approximately $75 million. The net cash impact of the total charge will be paid over an eight year period beginning in 2018, with the payment of approximately $9 million to be made this year.","At this point, we can't predict the 2018 tax benefit from the share-based compensation accounting change, because it is a subject of the changes and the value of Omnicom stock price and the impact of any future stock option exercises. However, because we expect to have less restricted stock vesting in 2018 versus 2017, at this point we expect the benefit will be lower in Q1 2018 and for the rest of the year.","Earnings from our affiliates totaled $800,000 for the quarter, down a bit from last year. And the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries increased $3.3 million to $33.4 million. The year-over-year increase in minority interest expense was primarily the result of operational improvements in our less than wholly-owned subsidiaries over the past year.","As a result, net income for the fourth quarter including the incremental tax charge we incurred in connection with the 2017 Tax Act was $254 million. Excluding [ph] the impact of the tax charge net income for Q4 was $360.7 million, an increase of $10.4 million or 3% versus Q4 of last year.","Now turning to Slide 2. Net income available for common shareholders for the quarter was $254 million, which includes the impact of the $106 million tax charge. Excluding the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, the net income available to common shareholders increased $11.6 million or 3.3% when compared to last year.","You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter decreased 2.3% versus Q4 of last year, $232.3 million. The decrease was driven by our share repurchases over the past year. Including the impact of the tax charge we incurred at the end of the year, our reported diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.9. Excluding the impact of the tax charge, our Q4 EPS totaled $1.55, up $0.08 or 5.4% versus Q4 of last year.","On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS, and other information for the full-year. 2017's full-year organic revenue growth was 3%, although net impact of FX in the year went up slightly positive at 0.3%. Factoring in the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions, which reduced revenue by about $650 million or 4.2% for the full-year, 2017 revenue totaled just under $15.3 billion, a decrease of $0.009 when compared to 2016.","For 2017, operating profit increased 2.5% to just under $2.06 billion, while EBITDA increased 2.3% to $2.17 billion. As for our annual margins, our operating margin increased 50 basis points and our EBITDA margin increased 40 basis points versus the full-year of 2016 results.","On Slide 5, you can see our reported 12-month diluted EPS was $4.65 a share. And on Slide 6. we provide the impact of the additional expense recorded in connection with the Tax Act ad on our full-year results. Excluding the impacts of the tax charge, our diluted EPS was $5.10 per share, an increase of $0.32 or 6.7% versus 2016.","Turning to Slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. During the fourth quarter due to the weakening of the U.S dollar against most of the foreign currencies we operate in, the net impact of the change in currency rates positively impacted our revenue adding 2.4% or $102 million. The major driver of our FX movement in the fourth quarter versus last year was the euro, which accounted for nearly half the net revenue increase from FX during the quarter.","In addition to the euro, the dollar weakened against the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the U.K pound. Making any assumption on how foreign currency rates will move over the next few months, let alone the balance of 2018 is of course highly speculative. However, as we enter into 2018, the currencies stay where they currently are based on our recent projections FX could positively impact our revenues by approximately 3% to 4% during the first quarter of 2018 and about 2% for the full-year.","The impact of our recent acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by $235 million in the quarter or 5.5%. As we discussed throughout the year, we completed several dispositions during the past year, including the disposition back in April of Novus, our specialty print media business which operated in the U.S and Canada.","Consistent with our historical approach, we will continue to evaluate our portfolio of businesses, pursue acquisition opportunities like the recently announced acquisition of the Snow Group, as well as make internal investments in our agencies. Based on transactions completed to date, the current expectations are that the impact of our disposition activity net of acquisitions will reduce revenue by approximately 4% to 4.5% in the first quarter and then return to plus or minus 1% for the remaining quarters of 2018, with the effects of our prior year dispositions and acquisitions will have cycle through.","While decidedly mix by market and by discipline, organic growth was positive on a global basis for the quarter of about $67 million or 1.6% for the fourth quarter. Geographically, our European and Asian regions continued their improved performance, but were partially offset by weakness this quarter in the U.S as well as in the U.K., which had difficult comps versus the strong performance in prior year, and the continued negative performance of our agencies in Brazil, in light of the issues in that market.","Slide 8 shows our mix of business by discipline. As you can see, we revised the detail we provide regarding our marketing services agencies to reflect the realignment of our disciplines and better capture the expanded scope of our services. As a result of this realignment, our CRM discipline has been disaggregated into two separate categories: CRM consumer experience, which includes our direct and digital marketing agencies, and Omnicom precision marketing group, as well as our consulting and branding agencies, shopper marketing agencies, and our experience from marketing agencies.","CRM Execution & Support, which includes our field marketing, sales support, merchandising and point-of-sale, as well as other specialized marketing and customer communication agencies. We also realigned and renamed our specialty communications discipline, so that it now exclusively includes agencies offering healthcare marketing and communication services.","For the fourth quarter, the split was 54% for advertising and 46% for marketing services with the full-year split being similar. As for their organic growth by discipline, it was mixed. Our advertising discipline was up 1.2%. Growth continues to be led by our media businesses, particularly internationally. Our advertising agencies, and in particular, our regional agency brands, the mixed results this quarter resulting from last year-end project spend by clients in this discipline.","CRM consumer experience was up 3.4% for the quarter. We saw organic growth in every region within the discipline led by our events businesses which had a strong performance with year-end projects in the quarter, results for the rest of the discipline was mixed, with positive performance from shopper marketing offset by our direct and digital agencies which continues to cycle through some prior losses.","CRM execution and support was also up 3.4% organically in the quarter with growth in sales support and custom communications, as well as our nonprofit specialty agencies, which offset declines in merchandising and point-of-sale. PR was up marginally this quarter in light of the difficult compact Q4 of 2016 when we have some benefits in the U.S from spending related to the 2016 presidential election. And healthcare was down 1.9% resulting from last year-end project spend from clients in this discipline, which also faced a difficult comparison to very strong growth in Q4 of 2016.","On Slide 9. which details the regional mix of business, you can see during the quarter the split was 54% for North America, 9% for the U.K., 20% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, 4% for Latin America and 2% for the Middle East and Africa markets.","Now turning to the details of our performance by region on Slide 10. Organic revenue growth in North America was down 0.8% due to the year-over-year reductions at our PR, healthcare, advertising and media agencies, which resulted primarily from last year-end project spend by clients, including political spend in PR related to the 2016 election as well cycling through some losses earlier in the year. This was partially offset by the positive performance of our CRM agencies, which was mixed by discipline.","Turning to Europe, the U.K was negative, down $0.007. Given the difficult comparison versus Q4 of 2017 when organic growth was 8.5%, results this quarter will mixed by discipline. With positive performances from our PR and media agencies which will offset by decreases in field marketing and at certain of our advertising agencies.","The rest of Europe was up 8.2% organically in the quarter. Within the Eurozone, Spain led the way and Netherlands had strong growth for the first time in a while. Additionally, Belgium and Italy performed well, while Germany was marginally positive. Growth in Europe outside the Eurozone was positive overall as well.","The Asia-Pacific region was up 6%. And we continue to see organic growth across most major markets in the region, including Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, and greater China, which grew but slower than the past. In Japan, however, was slightly lower in the quarter. ","In Latin America the performance of our agencies in Brazil continues to mirror the economic instability of that market and overshadowed strong performances from our agencies elsewhere in the region, particularly in Colombia and Mexico. As a result, the region was marginally negative in the quarter. And Middle East and Africa, our smallest region, was up 1.9% in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. And in comparing the full-year revenue for 2017 to 2016, not much has changed.","Turning to our cash flow performance, on Slide 12, you can see that we generated a little under $1.7 billion of free cash flow during the year, including the positive effect from changes in working capital. We made a big improvement in Q4 in working capital, more than making up for the decline in performance in the third quarter.","As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $515 million. As a reminder, the $0.05 increase in our quarterly dividend which we announced during the fourth quarter was effective with the payment we made last month, but that increase had no impact on 2017's cash flow.","Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled about $102 million. CapEx was $156 million, which is down a little from the prior year. Acquisitions including earn out payments totaled $85 million, down over $400 million versus 2016. And stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $558 million and were similar to last year's levels. All in, we generated $260 million in net free cash flow for the year.","Turning to Slide 14, regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt $4.92 5 billion, our net debt position at the end of the year was $1.13 billion, down nearly $800 million compared to December 31, 2016. The decrease was principally due to the positive change in operating capital of approximately $350 million.","Our excess free cash flow of $260 million for the year and positive impact of FX on our cash balances at year-end, which reduced net debt by about another $230 million. As for our debt ratios they remain solid. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.1x and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was below 1x and 0.5x. And due to the year-over-year increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio decreased 10.4x, but remains quite strong.","Turning to Slide 15, we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio was 24.1%, while our return on equity was 45.6% or 48.9% excluding the impact of the Tax Act.","And finally on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10 years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2008 through 2017 which totaled $10 billion. And the bar show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases. The sum of which during the same period was about $10.6 billion, resulting in a cumulative payout ratio of 105% over the last decade.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note, that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we\u2019re going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi. Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions. First, on the shortfall in the project business in Q4. I think you mentioned it came in below your expectations. Could you give us a bit more color exactly maybe what didn\u2019t materialize, is it certain verticals in terms of clients that didn\u2019t spend, or was it certain types? Just any more color there would be great. And then, my follow-up question is just really on how we should think about organic revenue growth for 2018 in light of what you know from your budgeting plans to your clients and your recent performance? Thank you.","John Wren","Sure. Good morning, Alexia. This is John. When you look through the project work, it's really between $25 million and $50 million in certain key areas that didn\u2019t come through. That versus the headwinds that we had from some of the losses in some of our independent branded agencies, that were still cycling through and the change in the way that we recorded revenue programmatic business. It was the convergence of all those three things that really impacted the percentages that you\u2019re seeing. There is nothing systemic or programmatic about it in any way. We also, the fourth quarter of '16 and all of '16 was when a lot of the activity was occurring which didn\u2019t reoccur in the first nine months of 2017. So we weren't [technical difficulty] business. We started to see a pickup in activity that in [ph] business wise towards the end of the -- the middle of the fourth quarter and it continues into this year. So we believe we\u2019ve taken all the actions that we need and it just turns out to be that it's regionally where the challenges showed up. I have to say that if you look at the first nine months of the year, we were performing -- or performing in what our range was, and so it was a little disappointing but nothing troubling. As we look at preliminary budget that we\u2019ve looked at so far, for '18 we are suggesting that organic growth will be between 2% to 3%. I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything here, Phil?","Philip Angelastro","Yes, I think most with respect to the projects that I think most of it certainly occurred in the U.S and in particular as John have said in some of our advertising businesses in the U.S as well as in our PR businesses and healthcare businesses. Last year in the fourth quarter they both grew close to 8%, so they kind of outperformed with last year at this time, so we had some pretty difficult comps. And as far as the organic expectations at this point, the 2% to 3% that John mentioned, is our current expectations for the year 2018.","Alexia Quadrani","And then just follow-up on that, in terms of profitability or margins, I would assume we'd -- we should see some margin expansion maybe in Q1, given we\u2019re still sort of cycling below our margin divestitures. Is that a fair way to look at the margin maybe outlook near-term?","Philip Angelastro","I think you can definitely confirm that we\u2019re going to continue to focus on EBIT dollars and not necessarily a margin percentage as we always said. We are going to continue to pursue our efficiency and effectiveness initiatives which we\u2019ve gotten a lot of traction on the last two years as well as this year, particular. What we\u2019re also going to continue invest in our agency is especially in the areas of data and analytics and in a number of digital transformation initiatives that we got going on. And we will continue to evaluate as we always do, finding the right balance between investing for sustainable growth and growing our EBIT dollars. So right now, I would say, we\u2019re not prepared to commit to a margin expansion target percentage at this time. But we\u2019re going to continue to reevaluate that as we reevaluate the investments we think we can make to continue to sustain our growth.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Philip Angelastro","Sure.","Operator","Next, Craig Huber with Huber Research. Please go ahead.","Craig Huber","Yes, good morning. Thank you. John, if you look back at 2017 and you think out to 2018, your 2% to 3% organic revenue growth perhaps target for the New Year. Can you just go through maybe the five or six areas that you think is holding back the organic growth and your peers as well? I mean, obviously, the economy seems like it's accelerating here in the U.S also around the world. But what\u2019s holding back your customers from spending more towards the ad service dollars that you get is not growing as much as it might be in the prior cycles? I have a few other questions. Thank you.","John Wren","Sure. There's a number of things. I mean, there are quite a number of areas were challenged by shareholder activism, changes in technology in a way that good s are distributed, because there's a lot of disruption going on out there, there's a lot of confusion as to what\u2019s the most effective way to reach that consumer happens today. Those are the principal challenges. And in terms of the macro type of look at things, I think that in 2018, I\u2019m -- what we\u2019re hoping to see is that with the stimulus that\u2019s been put, especially into the United States and the coordinating growth that we\u2019re seeing in the other markets around the world that as you get not necessarily in the first quarter, but as that money gets into consumer's hands later on in the year that you will see an increase in spending and clients will be addressing the needs and requirements of the consumer. So at this point, what we've done is we've made quite a number of changes to the portfolio of companies in the way that we go-to-market, we\u2019ve advanced our capabilities quite significantly, especially in the areas of data and digital and analytics. And we continue to double down those investments in what we are referring to the transformation effort, we will making internal investments as well as some external investments with new partners to make sure that we go all the way down the funnel and reach the consumer and only in reaching internal message, but also delivering the right message to try to get them to activate to buy and to sell things. So we believe we are taking quite a number of efforts in face of all these challenges that we\u2019ve seen in '17 and we're hoping that they're going to pay off pretty confident, that they\u2019re going to pay off as we get into '18.","Craig Huber","And then, also Phil, if I could ask, just wanted to get a sense of how much your cash is sitting outside the U.S., you perhaps could repatriate?","Philip Angelastro","I think it changes -- it certainly changes on a daily basis. But I think a substantial portion of our cash that\u2019s on the balance sheet, at 1231 was outside the U.S. The ability to bring it back is going to be much simpler now with the passage of tax reform. And, I think, managing our internal treasury systems as far as what cash is overseas when cash is in the U.S., it should be a little easier and we intend to bring back as much as we can bring back in a timely and efficient manner.","Craig Huber","And if you do bring that, still would it most likely to be for share buybacks?","Philip Angelastro","No, I don\u2019t think. When you go through the numbers, I don\u2019t -- in terms of the impact of tax reform on us, we expected to have from a dollars perspective, somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 million of benefit in, say '18 annualized. That\u2019s on a pro forma basis using our pre-tax income from '17 as proxy. So I don't think you\u2019re going to see really any difference in our -- any substantial difference in our approach to capital allocation. We are going to continue to pay strong dividend. We are going to continue to pursue accretive acquisitions and certainly we've done one recently and we\u2019re going to continue to look for more. And then with the balance of our free cash flow, we are going to invest that in share buybacks and some of it we\u2019re going to invest it in our agencies as we\u2019ve discussed just before. So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see anything dramatically change in terms of our capital allocation approach.","Craig Huber","Okay. Thank you.","Philip Angelastro","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thanks. Good morning. Thank you for the additional disclosure on the CRM segments. Maybe, John, could you talk a little bit about how you view those different disciplines in terms of the growth opportunity ahead of you? I know you made some management changes last year. The fourth quarter looked pretty healthy. Do you feel like those buckets -- those two CRM buckets are poised for growth in '18 based on what you\u2019re seeing today? And how do you compare that growth outlook to what you've seen in advertising and media which has been at least until Q4, more robust? And then I had a -- just a quick follow-up. Go ahead","John Wren","Sure. In the consumer experience bucket, I have a lot of hope for upside, because we made changes in branding and we\u2019re starting to see some stabilization and we will see growth. Our shopper promotion business increasingly is a digital activity where we\u2019re doing a lot of advice and changing to the -- changing delivery methods that you see in places like Amazon and others. Events and sports, we should get a bump somewhat this year principally because of the -- principally because of the improving economy plus in the first quarter there is a little bit of benefit associated with the Olympics in Korea. And where we\u2019re really doubling down is in digital and precision marketing and taking that activity as I mentioned and marrying it to the expense of investments we made in Analects, so we can better target the consumer for delivery, more effective messages for our clients. The other areas, there is a field marketing, sales support, specialty production and merchandising POS, those are the activities which have growth, but they're not as cutting edge, I would say as the first aim of CRM activities and we expect it to have our fair share of growth in those areas as we\u2019ve had in the past several years. So it's -- there's one -- thinking in one group, I would say and executing on the other and clients needs will be taken care accordingly.","Benjamin Swinburne","Okay. And just, Phil, just on the margin comment, if you guys land in your guidance range for organic, are you suggesting margins will be kind of flat plus or minus? I just wanted to see if you could add a little more color to the margin outlook for the year?","Philip Angelastro","I think, again, we\u2019re more focused on growing the dollars, but I think by not committing to a margin expansion number now as we're looking out of the year and evaluating what we\u2019re going to invest in and how much we need to invest. I think our expectation is margins are flat for the year. And if that evaluation changes, we will certainly let everybody know as we go through the year.","Benjamin Swinburne","Okay. Thank you both.","Philip Angelastro","Sure.","Operator","And next go to Steven Cahall with RBC. Please go ahead.","Steven Cahall","Yes, thank you. Sorry to kind of ask somewhat critical and big picture question. But I was wondering if you could just kind of circle back on your organic growth guidance. To be honest, it didn\u2019t sound entirely confident. So do you feel firmly that that 2% to 3% or the midpoint of it is something that you can look forward to the full-year based on your budgeting process, or should we kind of read a lot of risk into that statement? And then, relatedly, you talked about the impact from Accuen and political this year as well as net new business. So should we think about a lot of this growth as backend loaded, as we approach the year?","John Wren","Well, to answer your question, I was told after I first mentioned it, that my mic was weaker and I should speak up. So willingly confident, 2% to 3%, I hope you\u2019re hearing me clear now.","Steven Cahall","Yes, absolutely.","John Wren","And some of those activities -- the political spending for the midterm elections which we suggest will be coming back similar to almost what happened in the presidential elections going to occur is not going to occur in the first quarter, it's going to start to occur as you get little later into the year. There are also the stimulus that people are going to start to see in their paychecks from tax cuts and some other activities. They\u2019re not there in January and February, but they will start to creep into people's pockets as we get later -- a little bit later in the year. So this year with the level of activity, the level of stimulus that\u2019s occurring, the calendar itself we don't expect a radical shift from what our past performance has been, but we do expect some shift. So having said, I\u2019m not saying it's all going to occur like some of our competitors in the fourth quarter.","Philip Angelastro","I think, just one specific follow-up on the Accuen reference. So in '17, Accuen -- in the fourth quarter of '17, Accuen was down about $12 million globally and $17 million in the U.S. That\u2019s the trend that we expect to continue. So overall, the programmatic business is very strong, but we continue to see a transition of some clients moving toward a more traditional agency pass-through [ph] solution from our performance-based bundled solution. Plenty of clients are very comfortable with the performance-based solution, want to continue down that path, but ultimately, the business itself is growing. We are happy with it, and we expect the base business to grow -- to continue to grow in '18. But I think the shift will continue, which will have similar negative impact on the reported result.","John Wren","I just want -- I want to add, the billings associated with that activity which are now up double-digits from what we can see sitting here today for programmatic activity. The way we report them on a -- in a more traditional sense rather than in a bundled sense has an impact on reported revenue. It doesn\u2019t have an impact really on our profitability associated with those activities.","Steven Cahall","Am I correct that, that started kind of late first half of last year, that shift in behavior, so you will start to cycle through that maybe through the -- by the second half or is it really just the Q4 when you start to cycle through it?","John Wren","No, I think it's a change -- it's a trend, it's a change in the business. So our activity, our expertise, our profitability from those activities, we fully expect to go up. We don't expect the same contribution in revenue that we receive in the past, because of the way the clients are purchasing new services from us.","Philip Angelastro","Yes, I think if you look back the business grew quite a bit because it was brand-new in '14 and '15. And in '16 it's when the transition started to occur. So in '16 the number is in terms of the growth rate came down and that in '17 we've seen some net negatives in terms of reductions overall in that business.","John Wren","The other thing that we're hopeful, we can predict. As we sit here today, there's probably $15 billion worth of new accounts that are in review, of which I think we're at risk defending about $2 billion of that. The rest of it is an opportunity for us to win our fair share and that should contribute to our overall growth.","Steven Cahall","Great. Thank you.","Philip Angelastro","I think, operator, given that the market's open or just about to open, I think we\u2019ve time for one more question.","Operator","And that will be from Tim Nolan with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nolan","Great. Thanks very much. You actually got most of the questions I had. I wonder though you mentioned a number of divestitures you\u2019ve done last year. I wonder if there might be more to come in 2018? You\u2019re talking about some organizational efficiencies and so forth. And is it possible to say if that affects your guidance for 2018? Do you have a better growth rate in '18, given having reduced some of the underperforming or less strategic businesses last year?","John Wren","I think we\u2019re going to continue to reevaluate the portfolio, we do that on a regular basis. And we're continuing to go through our final planning cycle here for '18 with all of our agencies and networks. So as of now we don't have an expectation that beyond early -- very early in the second quarter when we cycle through large disposition we completed last year to be back at a similar number for the rest of '18. That said, I think our expectations of plus or minus 1% from the second quarter of '18 on as far as the net acquisition disposition activity, it's based on what we know today. So deals we've completed either acquisitions or dispositions, we\u2019ve completed as of now, that could change and the expectation right now is it's not going to change significantly. And if and when we close new acquisitions, the number will grow. But that\u2019s not to say that when opportunities come along to divest and dispose of nonstrategic assets, which I would say we continue to evaluate we're going to take advantage of those opportunities if they make sense for us and for shareholders.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to introduce you to the host for today\u2019s conference call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Shub Mukherjee. Please go ahead.","Shub Mukherjee","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our second quarter 2015 earnings call. On the call with me today is John Wren, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer.","We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release. We have posted on our recently relaunched website at www.omnicomgroup.com, this morning\u2019s press release along with the presentation covering the information that we will review this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I have been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our Investor Presentation.","And to point out, that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially.","I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation material.","We\u2019re going to begin this morning\u2019s call with an overview of our business from John Wren. Then, Phil Angelastro will review our financial results. And then we will open up the line for your questions.","John Wren","Thank you, Shub. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. I am pleased to speak to you this morning about our second quarter 2015 business results. As I\u2019m sure you have seen, Omnicom had a strong quarter with organic growth up 5.3% and EBITDA margins increasing 10 basis points. Based on our year to date results, we\u2019re on track to meet revenue and margin targets for the full year.","As we mentioned on our year end 2014 and first quarter 2015 earnings calls, we expected the continued strengthening of the US dollar versus other currencies would create headwinds to our 2015 reported revenue and net income. At the same time, it\u2019s important to point out that the majority of our non-US operations are naturally hedged with both revenue and expenses in the same currency.","In the second quarter, the significant change in exchange rates versus the prior period resulted in a 7.1% or $275 million decline in reported revenue. Year to date, FX has reduced our revenue by $500 million. On a constant currency basis, EPS would have increased an additional 7% for both the quarter and the year. Phil will provide more details about the impact of foreign exchange by market later in the call. However, at this stage, if rates remain where they are today, the impact will moderate during the remainder of the year.","Turning now to organic revenue growth, North America increased 5.9%. The main drivers were brand advertising which includes our media operations, specialty healthcare and our CRM businesses. The UK generated 5.4% growth. The performance in the UK was broad based across all disciplines with the exception of our PR operations which had difficult comps versus the second quarter of 2014.","Organic revenue growth in our European region was 3.9%. In the Euro Markets, Germany continued to outperform with over 5% growth. France was flat and the Netherlands was negative. Overall though, the euro-currency markets were up almost 4%. Outside Euro Markets, Turkey, Poland and Sweden had above-average results. Russia moderated to low single digit growth in the quarter.","Looking at Asia Pacific, overall growth was 7.6%. Among our large markets, growth was strong in Australia, China and Singapore. Latin America was down 9.6% for the quarter. A positive performance in Mexico was offset by weaknesses in Brazil and Chile. The decline in Brazil is attributable to tough comps when compared to Q2 2014 World Cup spending and in 2015 from sluggish economic conditions. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our performance and where we stand halfway through this year. ","I\u2019d now like to make a few remarks on the macroeconomic picture in terms of things we\u2019re watching in the back half of 2015. First, in the last few weeks, we\u2019ve seen another economic crisis play out in Greece. Our Greek businesses are small and are expected to decline. In 2014, annual revenue was about $12 million. So the impact will not be material.","Second, as I mentioned earlier, China is still performing well for us and we remain bullish on China, despite recent setbacks in property and stock markets. Two other large markets, Brazil and Russia, are projected to have negative GDP growth in 2015 and face inflationary pressures that will take some time to reverse. Brazil should, however, benefit next year as we start to focus on the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio.","Lastly, the US continues to improve with moderate GDP growth. Hopefully, anticipated actions by the Fed later this year will not cause any harm to the US recovery or emerging markets.","Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow generation, they remain very strong, enabling us to navigate and be opportunistic in these alpha markets. Our consistent practice for the use of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases remains unchanged as does our commitment to a strong balance sheet and maintaining our credit ratings.","I\u2019d now like to spend a few minutes discussing the unprecedented number of media buying and planning assignments that are currently up for a review. There is more media business up for review from large marketers at the present time than I personally have ever seen before.","We estimate we\u2019re about halfway through the agency pitches for these large assignments and I\u2019m pleased to report we\u2019re doing quite well. We recently added new media assignments from SC Johnson, which is a global win from one of our top competitors as well as Wells Fargo in the United States and Bacardi globally. These and a number of other wins brought in annual billings of over $1.4 billion in the first six months of 2015.","And just last week, we were awarded Unilever\u2019s Australia media business following the win of their global search businesses a few months ago. Throughout this unprecedented period, it\u2019s been important to note our current clients are our first priority. Therefore, we\u2019ve been very selective in choosing which media assignments to pursue and have elected not to participate in many reviews, 21st Century Fox, Citibank, Coke, Cody and L'Oreal.","Looking at [things] still in progress, I\u2019ll classify them in two buckets. First, accounts we are defending. On these assignments, we have about $1.2 billion in media billings. However, in most cases, we share these accounts with competitors and we estimate there is about $1 billion in upside potential if we\u2019re successful in winning all of them.","Next, we\u2019re pursuing a few select new assignments where we have either no relationship or a very small one and where the upside is much greater. However, rather than trying to predict the outcome of these reviews, we can confirm that we are in a good position to benefit from any changes these large marketers make.","With the abnormally high number of large media assignments, it is an opportune time to look at what is behind many of them. We know the media landscape has become more complex and many of the reviews are strategic reevaluations of agency suppliers. Technology has radically changed media planning and buying.","The rise of digital data and analytics has given marketers the ability to more precisely understand how consumers are using media. In areas such as programmatic buying and micro targeting, clients want to make sure that they have the right partner with the right resources in this space. We\u2019ve also seen a number of available media channels increase exponentially in the past several years.","Over the past 12 months in particular, we\u2019ve seen a rapid growth in transition to online video really take hold. With many more media channels and online video available to consumers on so many devices, advertisers want to make sure they have the right strategies in place. Given these areas of focus by our clients, Omnicom is especially well positioned as a result of our investments in analytic and our data management platform.","Using this platform, our people today are analyzing campaigns on a granular level for hundreds of Omnicom clients around the globe. These are differentiating efforts for us and are proving to be a competitive advantage. While these data and analytic platforms are more important than ever, it is of course the talent of our people in putting them to work across all of our disciplines that really make the difference.","At this year's Cannes, we proved once again we have the best people in the business producing award-winning campaigns for our clients. Here are a few highlights demonstrating the depth and breadth of our talent. Over hundred Omnicom agencies won nearly 250 Lions from approximately 50 different countries across 21 communication categories.","CDM, one of the world\u2019s leading healthcare agencies won the inaugural Healthcare Network of the Year award. BBDO was the runner-up for Network of the Year and had a record Cannes with 29 agencies winning almost 120 Lions. Omnicom Media Group and its flagship agencies, OMD and PHD, won over 60 Lions, including three grand prixes for clients such as McDonald's, Apple, Under Armour and Harvey Nichols. I want to congratulate all of our people and our agencies for their outstanding work.","Our investment in talent, technology and partnerships are making a difference for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these growth areas as the marketing environment becomes increasingly complex.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?","Philip Angelastro","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our businesses continued to deliver against their financial and strategic objectives and meeting the needs of their clients.","For the second quarter, organic revenue growth of 5.3% was once again above our expectations as the US maintained its solid performance and we experienced strong performance in the UK, Germany and Canada. Our underlying businesses continued to perform well and we had good balance to our organic growth performance across our disciplines. Exchange rates continued to create a considerable headwind on our revenue.","This quarter, the negative impact of FX reduced revenue by 7.1% or $275 million. And as has been the case since the fourth quarter of last year, FX in the quarter was negative in all of our significant foreign markets. Including the small net positive impact from our acquisitions, net of dispositions, revenue for the quarter was about $3.8 billion, down 1.7% versus Q2 last year. I\u2019ll discuss our revenue growth in greater detail in a few minutes.","Turning to EBITDA and operating income, EBITDA for the second quarter of 2015 decreased by $8 million to $566 million versus $574 million in Q2 of last year. Exchange rates also had a significant negative impact on our EBITDA for the quarter. But since the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, the negative impact of FX on margins was negative, but not significant.","And operationally, our efforts to increase efficiencies throughout the organization continued to make positive progress. As a result, the EBITDA margin for the quarter of 14.9% was up a bit versus Q2 2014.","Operating income decreased $9 million to $539 million for the quarter. And although FX also negatively impacted operating income for the quarter and the amortization of our intangible assets resulting from our recent acquisitions increased on a year over year basis, our total operating margin of 14.2% was flat versus Q2 of 2014.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $34.6 million, up $900,000 versus Q2 of 2014 and up $400,000 from the first quarter. Versus the first quarter, the increase in net interest expense of $400,000 was the result of increased borrowing on our commercial paper facilities, partially offset by additional interest income earned overseas.","Versus Q2 of last year, the positive impact of the floating interest rate swaps we entered into during Q2 and Q3 of 2014 effectively offset the additional interest expense related to the issuance last October of $750 million of 10-year senior notes. However, net interest expense was up $900,000 due to a decrease in interest earned on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers, primarily driven by negative FX translation as well as additional interest expense from increased US LIBOR rates on our CT borrowing.","Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% continues to be in line with our current tax rate expectations for 2015. As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, our quarterly reported tax rate of 31.1% reflected the impact of an $11 million tax benefit we recognized related to merger expenses incurred in 2013, which were required to be capitalized for tax purposes at the time. Upon terminating the merger in May of 2014, we recognized the tax benefit related to those expenses.","So to better understand the year over year change on the tax line and in our tax rate, in addition to the reported 2014 figures, we\u2019re also presenting our 2014 quarter and year to date numbers excluding the impact of this tax benefit.","Earnings from our affiliates of $4 million was flat year over year. The allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $4.4 million to $28.8 million, largely due to the impact of FX because a significant portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the US. As a result, net income for the quarter was just below $314 million. That\u2019s flat versus last year after excluding the impact of the tax benefit discussed above from Q2 2014\u2019s results and it\u2019s down 3.5% or $11.3 million versus our reported Q2 results last year.","Turning to slide 3, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $3.9 million of net income to participating securities which for us are the dividend-paying unvested restricted shares held by our employees was $310 million.","You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 245.7 million. That\u2019s down 4.8% versus last year and was driven by our share buyback program which we resumed during the second quarter of 2014. As a result, diluted EPS of the quarter was $1.26 per share, up 2.4%, an increase of $0.03 versus Q2 2014 reported EPS or up 5.9%, an increase of $0.07 versus last year after excluding the impact of the tax benefit discussed above from Q2 2014\u2019s result.","On slides 4 through 6, we provided the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year to date period. To save some time, I\u2019ll just give you few highlights. Our organic revenue growth was 5.2% during the first six months of the year. The significant FX headwind caused revenue to decrease by 6.8% and after factoring in the impact of acquisitions net of dispositions, of 0.3%.","Revenue declined on a year-to-date basis by 1.3% to just under $7.3 billion. While FX also negatively impacted EBITDA, which decreased 1.1% to $971 million, both our EBITDA and operating margins were unchanged when compared to last year.","Turning to taxes on page 5, our effective tax rate for 2015 of 32.8% is in line with our expectations, while the reported 2014 tax expense and tax rate reflect the impact of the $11 million tax benefit we recognized in Q2 2014 related to merger expenses incurred in 2013, which became deductable after the termination of the merger.","As you can see, similar to way we presented our Q2 results, the comparative results for the six-month period are presented both including and excluding the tax benefit. Excluding the impact of this tax benefit, the tax rate for the six-month period in 2014 was 33.5%. And our six-month diluted EPS was $2.09 per share, which is up $0.09 or 4.5% versus 2014\u2019s reported figure of $2 per share and up $0.13 or 6.6% versus EPS after excluding the impact of the tax benefit recorded in Q2 2014.","Turning to slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. First, as I mentioned, this quarter we balanced organic growth across all disciplines. However, the effects of FX more than offset their performance. On a year over year basis, in the second quarter, the US dollar continued to strengthen against almost all of our major currencies. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $275 million or 7.1%. The FX impact was greatest in our European markets. The decline in the value of the euro and the pound represented nearly 60% of the FX decrease during the second quarter.","Looking ahead, considering a steep decline in the value of all major currencies against the US dollar, if rates continue to stay where they are, FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 7% during the third quarter and approximately 6% for the full year.","Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $5 million. While we\u2019ve added businesses both in the US and in Latin America and Europe over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve also made some strategic dispositions during that period as well in EMEA and the US.","And finally, organic growth was positive $204 million or 5.3% this quarter. Again, we had another quarter with solid organic growth across most of our major markets except for France, the Netherlands and Brazil and we had good growth across our disciplines except PR which was up slightly in the quarter.","The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included continued excellent performance across our media businesses and solid growth in CRM. Our full-service healthcare businesses driven by new business wins over the last few quarters posted double-digit organic growth in the quarter.","Our UK businesses continued to perform well across most disciplines and we also had excellent performances in the emerging markets this quarter, including Mexico, Turkey and our Middle Eastern agencies. In the Euro Markets, driven by strong performance in Germany and Spain, overall organic growth remained positive. And across the Asia Pacific region, our performance was once again strong.","Slide 8 covers our year to date revenue performance. The impact of FX reduced revenue by $0.5 billion over the first six months of 2015 or 6.8%, while organic growth over that same period was 5.2%. ","On slide 9, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, split of revenue was 60% from North America, 10% UK, 16% for the rest of Europe, and 10% for Asia-Pacific, with the remaining 4% being split between Latin America and Africa and the Middle East.","Turning to slide 10, in North America, both the US and Canada turned in solid performances and we had organic revenue growth of 5.9%. While the media businesses continued to perform well, this quarter also saw a strong growth from our full-service healthcare businesses and CRM businesses in the region.","Turning to international markets, the UK continued its strong performance this quarter, except for our PR discipline which faced difficult comps versus Q2 last year. The rest of Europe was up 3.9%, led by Germany and Spain, while France was flat and the Netherlands continues to lag negatively. Our performance in the non-Euro Markets in Europe continued to be solid.","Before leaving Europe, in Greece, where the economic and political situation is uncertain, we have a very small presence with revenues of less than 0.1% of our consolidated revenues. So we do not expect much exposure. But given the uncertainty, would expect a continued decline in our businesses going forward.","The Asia Pacific region was up 7.6%, with most markets performing well, including China, Australia and Singapore. One market that lagged was Latin America which was down 9.6% organically. The positive performance in Mexico was offset by weakness in Chile and Brazil.","In Chile, the decline resulted from a significant local client loss in 2014 that we are now finished cycling through. In Brazil, the decline resulted from both the difficult comp when compared to Q2 of 2014 due to the World Cup and from general softness in that market. And finally, the Africa and Middle East region, our relatively small in total, was up 11.9%, led by our businesses in the UAE and South Africa.","Slide 11 shows our mix of business for the quarter split equally between advertising services and marketing services. As per their respective organic growth rates, advertising services were up 6.4% or $125 million and marketing services were up 4.1% or $79 million.","Within marketing services, CRM was up 4.3%. Most of our categories within the CRM discipline were up a bit year over year, with only sales promotion businesses down and our field marketing businesses close to flat. Public relations was up slightly at 0.3% and specialty communications was up about 8% on the strength of the performance of our full-service healthcare businesses.","On slide 12 we present our mix of business by industry sector. Comparing our year to date revenue in 2015 to last year's figures, you can see there were no meaningful changes in this mix.","Turning to our cash flow performance on slide 13, in the first half of the year, we generated $757 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital.","As for our primary uses of cash on slide 14, dividends paid to our common shareholders increased to $251 million, reflecting the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend during Q2 of 2014. Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders totaled $61 million. Capital expenditures were $107 million, up from last year due to an increase in leasehold improvements related to some recent real estate consolidations and acquisitions including earn out payments net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments totaled $65 million.","And finally, stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plan totaled $386 million. Since we restarted our share repurchase program just over a year ago, post the termination of the merger, we gave spent about $1.38 billion and purchased about 19 million shares. All in, we out-spent our free cash flow by about $113 million during the first six months of 2015.","Turning to slide 15, focusing first on our capital structure, our total debt of $4.57 billion is down about $37 million from the first quarter, mainly due to a decrease in the fair value adjustment to our debt carrying value as required by US GAAP related to the in-the-money amount of our interest rate swaps.","Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.2 billion. The increase in our net debt of about $690 million over the past 12 months was driven primarily by the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $254 million as well as the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balance over the last 12 months of approximately $402 million using period end spot rates.","Although our net debt has increased over the past year, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt to EBITDA was 2.1 times and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times. And due to both the decrease in our interest expense and an increase in EBITDA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.9 times.","Turning to slide 16, we continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of strategic acquisitions as well as focused internal development initiatives. Over the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 17.6% and return on equity increased to 35.9%.","And finally on slide 17, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 through the second quarter, which totaled $10.5 billion. And the bar show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.4 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 109%.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides on the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we are going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll first go to the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess I wanted to start with capital allocation, your acquisition activity seems to be fairly moderate at this point. John, wondering if you could update us on what you are seeing in the M&A pipeline, relative prices across the globe, what your appetite is and whether that\u2019s changed? And then a quick question on buybacks and dividends and the ratio and spread between those, wondering if you have any updated thoughts on shareholder capital returns. Thanks very much.","John Wren","There are quite a few acquisitions that are in the pipeline and August and September, I think, many of the things that we\u2019ve been working on will come to a final decision both on our part and that of the sellers. We\u2019re muted in the first half because as we were doing acquisitions we\u2019ve also taken a couple of small companies that no longer fit the portfolio and we\u2019ve divested ourselves, that\u2019s why you see the net number affecting our overall revenues.","The prices, I would say, the prices [are pretty dear], no one is giving anything away and certainly nothing we\u2019re interested in purchasing. But they\u2019re not \u2013 we are still very disciplined in the way that we approach it and we have to make sure ourselves that we can extract the proper value before we\u2019ll actually finish and close the deal. So I\u2019m hopeful, there is a couple that we\u2019ve been talking to which expand our presence in markets outside the United States and also a couple in media that I\u2019m hoping that will get accomplished in the back half of this year. But I\u2019m not in control \u2013 without getting requisite about the price, I\u2019m not in control about how the process finishes out.","With respect to our capital program, that really remains the same, Peter. First, we plan to utilize our free cash flow really in three manners. First, to pay dividends; the second, to pay for and hopefully increase the number of acquisitions we do and then share buybacks, turn out to be the fall out the difference between the amount of cash we generate and taking care of those first two items. There is no foreseeable change in terms of our attitude of what we\u2019re planning to do.","Philip Angelastro","Just one thing to add, I think on the buyback front, we certainly have come off the last 12 months of some increased activity probably higher than we\u2019ve historically bought back, mainly since we were out of the market for an extended period of time. I think we don\u2019t foresee going back to those levels, the levels we were at in Q3 and Q4 of last year as well as Q2 of last year. But depending on the timing of the acquisitions and what we close and what we don\u2019t get closed, that will have an impact on the buyback activity for the balance of the year.","Peter Stabler","Quick follow-up for Phil, can you tell us what the contribution of digital media pass through was to the organic growth number for the quarter?","Philip Angelastro","Yeah, so the growth in our Accuen business for the quarter was about $30 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Just two quick questions. First one on the outlook for organic growth, you\u2019ve come in well ahead of our full year guide of 3.5% for the year in the first half of the year. What should we expect in the back half, any color there? And just following up to the earlier question about the programmatic contribution, maybe if you could talk a little bit about how the impact is on profitability in the quarter?","John Wren","Certainly the over-achievement in organic growth that we\u2019ve had in the first half versus what our original guess was for the year, those will continue to pass through for the balance of the year. We don\u2019t expect to go into that. And at this point, until we have a little bit more clarity on a few things, I\u2019d say looking to the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we\u2019d still stay conservative and stay with the 3.5% back half growth of revenue.","Alexia Quadrani","And then in terms of the margins on the [indiscernible] pass through?","Philip Angelastro","I think we\u2019re fine and are finding that the margins are, as we described previously, we expect that overtime as we get more scale that the margins in programmatic space are going to approximate our media margins overall and we\u2019re going to end up with a normal margin contribution relative to the rest of our media businesses. And I think we\u2019re still on track to do that.","Alexia Quadrani","And then John if I could just follow-up on some of the commentary you had in your opening remarks about unprecedented set of media count reviews right now, I think you highlighted that maybe one of the drivers might be the technology changes we\u2019re seeing and the allocation decisions of media might be causing advertisers take a closer look at their media relationships, would you say that\u2019s sort of the main reason that you\u2019re saying that lot of these reviews are coming into play? And if you would, any commentary on possible pressure on margins, just in maintaining a relationship, do you have to [indiscernible] keep that relationship in review?","John Wren","Sure. As you can imagine, Alexia, I\u2019m not in the room when the picture is being made, but I\u2019m following them very closely with Daryl Simm and the other leadership people in OMG. And despite all of the other noise and everything else that\u2019s out there in the marketplace, I really do think it\u2019s been very consistent that clients are really reevaluating how they\u2019ve done things in the past and they\u2019re reevaluating their teams that they are doing with.","And we\u2019ve been, as I said, I think we\u2019re about halfway through the reviews that have been called, it\u2019s a guess, but we think that will all be decided by October and it will be very interesting to see who the net winners are in this round. So I\u2019m very confident that with the amount of revenue we\u2019ve already won and the few losses that we\u2019ve suffered, we\u2019re well ahead of the game and looking out there should only be upside opportunity for us. The second part of your question? I\u2019m sorry.","Alexia Quadrani","Do you feel the industry, not just Omnicom, but the industry has to give better \u2013 some concessions or some better rates and fees in order to keep these media count when they\u2019re up for review?","John Wren","Except for one client that we consciously elected to not pitch because of terms that they wanted, we haven\u2019t seen people raising forward and discounting things. The clients are fairly sophisticated and they know that at the end of the day, they\u2019ll get what they pay for.","I think it has more to do with the complexity of the marketplace and it turns out to be a process that ultimately should be beneficial to us, on my side of the table, but it\u2019s totally also very beneficial to the client because they challenge their own media folk to say, listen, we\u2019ve been doing this this way up until now, should we be changing the way that we\u2019re planning or executing.","And we\u2019re seeing clients rethinking their whole behavior. So I don\u2019t see \u2013 and in terms of the cost advantages, it turns out that it\u2019s an unprecedented time, but the people who are using naturally are senior people and probably be just working a little bit harder than they were before all these pitches commenced.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research.","Craig Huber","A couple housekeeping questions, if I could. How many shares did you buyback in the quarter, please?","Philip Angelastro","Just give me one second, Craig, and I'll get that for you. I think it's about 1.6 million, a little over 1.6 million shares.","Craig Huber","And then in terms of expectations for the full year, should investors expect you guys not to outspend your free cash this year on dividends with small acquisitions and share buybacks, but not to outspend free cash like you've done in some other recent years?","Philip Angelastro","I don't think we'd expect not to outspend, but depending on the timing of some acquisitions that we're working on, we'll probably come close in terms of an expectation of spending our free cash flow may be a little bit more and some things could change in the next six months between now and then. But I don't think you should expect that we'll outspend it to any significant degree, but we certainly will look to spend all the free cash flow by the end of the year and maybe a little bit more.","Craig Huber","And then, John, question for you on all these media reviews going on right now, is it your expectation everything is all said and done that yourself and the other three major players in the marketplace that these revenues just move back and forth between the four of you or do you think on a net basis a decent amount of that could actually get moved over to some smaller third-party perhaps programmatic players out there?","John Wren","No. I fully expect that the four or five players that are out there will be the beneficiaries and suffer the changes that happen. I don't see money being diverted to these small ad tech players at this point and certainly not from the reviews that are going on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis","Phil, just one question. With some of the changes you discussed, I guess maybe you and John discussed from a client perspective and technology, there's a narrative in the industry that there will be longer-term margin pressure and so if that's going to be the case, can you talk about some flexibility you may have on the cost side of your business either on the salary or the OMG line?","Philip Angelastro","Sure. I think you know from John's comments, in the last question, I think we're going into these pitches in particular looking to provide value to clients and for clients look at that value and realize that to get what they need and to get the best services that they're going to need competitively priced it. We've approached the business and we'll continue to in approach the business looking for efficiencies internally and we've been down that path, we're going to continue down that path. We think we're pretty efficient, but we think there's certainly room for improvement and we're pushing pretty hard on several fronts as it relates to that.","So we manage the business for the long-term. We're going to continue to make the investments that we think need to be made and find the right balance of growth and profitability and returns, and we're going to take whatever actions we think we need to get there. Some of them are certainly longer term in nature; some of them are shorter term in nature.","But we expect to continue to manage the portfolio and maintain or improve over time our margin profile. So we don't think this is really any new or dramatically different. We've always realized we need to continue to push on the efficiency front. We\u2019re going to continue to do that so that we can continue to generate the returns that our shareholders are looking for and generate the margins that we think will allow us to continue to invest in the business and have sustainable growth and sustainable profits.","John Wren","And just as examples that ongoing process which occurs, we are in the area of real estate and payroll that's probably our largest next expense, we have probably changed the living conditions of close to 12,000 people who work for us just in the first six months of this year in terms of moving from existing space which were legacy leases into more modern open plan spaces.","The net effect is you do become more productive when you're working like that and we\u2019ve been able to on a net basis lower our future rentals by doing that. There's items in areas like that going throughout the whole cost system within the company to try to become more efficient.","John Janedis","Maybe one quick one just on Accuen, to what extent are there more markets to expand outside the US? And of the $30 million you referenced, is there a meaningful piece of that international or is it mostly US in terms of the growth?","Philip Angelastro","I think you got to give me a minute on the split, but I\u2019m not sure I have it here, I may have to get back to you. But we've expanded over the last I'd say at this point 15 to 18 months to most of the significant markets outside the US where Accuen operates and where we see it operating. There might be some opportunity for some of the smaller markets outside the US that we're going to continue to pursue, but we're pretty much in any and all of the significant markets we expect to be in.","So I think we see opportunity for Accuen to grow both in the US and outside the US, but there's a decent amount of the growth that's coming from the rest of the world. And I can get back to you with a more specific number, but it's probably this quarter say roughly around 50\/50, US and outside the US.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon","Two questions: one for Phil and one for John. Phil, obviously in the areas of analytics, programmatic, you\u2019ve seen a big ramp up in your offering there over the past four or five years, do you see a point where that starts to even off a little bit, ease off a little bit rather, simply as you move past the stage of getting that new business established, or does really the increased demand keep that headcount growing at the same rate?","And then for John, you made a good point in discussing the media reviews earlier as how much everyone's somewhat conflicted out of certain pitches because of current client relationships. Would you expect that because of that maybe the hold rate actually ends up little bit higher just because we've got so many of them going on at once?","John Wren","I have an opinion, I just hesitate to speculate. I think there will be some \u2013 even if there is a hold, I do think there is a reevaluation of approach, so on some of the very, very large pieces of business that still aren't decided, you might see adjustments to what \u2013 even if the same supplier holds onto it, the activities that we're doing in the past and the activities that will be doing in the future.","But I would say that there will be some net change, but in terms of, I think the revenue of each of the larger holding companies, there's not much. When you look at it as percentage point, there's probably only, in the worst case, a couple of percentage points which could possibly move. And if they don't retain them, it's only a couple of percentage points that the winner would gain. It's just the state of the play at the moment. They're all significant, significant psychologically. I don't know if that answers your question or not?","Daniel Salmon","Helpful. A little color. Thanks.","Philip Angelastro","So on the analytics and programmatic front, I think our perspective is its still early days. Although we've been making investments for the last five years or so in our data and analytics platform, Annalect, and Accuen has been around now for, in a sizable way for the last year and a half or so to two years. We think it's still somewhat early days. We expect the growth opportunities to continue in the future, but as the businesses get bigger and the base gets bigger, we're not going to be surprised if the rate of growth slows a bit just because of the math of the numbers.","But when you talk about the data and analytics side, and Accuen, we see some big opportunities there for using that platform to drive growth and drive insights through the rest of our lines of businesses, not just through the media business and the programmatic space.","So we see some opportunities certainly in our CRM businesses and frankly the rest of our portfolio to utilize the data and analytics to actually drive some and find some meaningful insights that we can use and provide big ideas for our clients that are going to help us grow in areas other than just programmatic media. So we're optimistic for the opportunities in the future. A lot can change and will change as it has over the last few years here, but we think we've got a great set of assets that we're going to be able to build on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen","John, I just wanted to come back to your question, to your comment on, you referenced potential rate rises by the Fed. Could you give us your thoughts on what does a rising rate environment mean for the ad market? And my understanding is that is often a response to rising inflation, which means pricing power increases a little bit, which is generally good for marketers and hence, for agencies. Maybe that's a little simplistic. If you wouldn't mind just please explaining what a rising rate environment means.","John Wren","Sure. From your lips to God's ears, I would like a little inflation back in this business. It's a long, long time since we've had it. The problem is and I'm no economic expert, the problem is it's been what, six years since the Fed has been in these markets. And there's been a lot of growth not so much in the industry, but across the spectrum which has been effectively free for large companies that could access capital freely.","It's hard to gauge the disruption it might have in some of the emerging markets. As we reinforce the strength of the dollar versus \u2013 through the interest rate mechanisms and actions versus other places in the world. So does it have a direct impact on the capital structures or the ability for advertising industry to function? No. And I think it will be a good long time because I think the Fed hikes when they come will be very gradual and take quite a period of time before they become impactful. So it's just yet another unknown. It's nothing that we fear is something that we watch and we try to gauge with our existing client base around the world.","Philip Angelastro","Operator, I think we have for time for one more quick question.","Operator","Thank you. And that will be from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank","I'll try and make it quick. It's actually a follow-up, I think, to an earlier question on the call about wins and losses. I think we've always viewed win some, lose some, right. You win some, you lose some. You guys have a really strong platform. Occasionally, you lose and you usually make up for it over time.","I think the question is less about the structural issues of procurement getting more involved in programmatic and more about as a general rule, do legacy clients tend to be more profitable than newly acquired clients, given the infrastructure you've already invested in and historical pricing? Does a shift from legacy clients to newer clients impact margin in the same way it always might have or is it not an issue?","John Wren","It's not significant. And you might, if enough new business was won in a particular quarter, you might see a minor blip because the least profitable time for someone in the agency business in dealing with the client is when we first acquire it because we have to gear up and put a team together and start to work. And oddly enough, some of the most profitable moments in the history of a client are after you\u2019ve been put on notice. But to answer your question, I don't think it significantly moves the needle for anyone in the larger holding company type of environment.","Philip Angelastro","Thank you all for joining the call. We appreciate you taking the time.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference service. You may now disconnect."],"16315":["Omnicom Group Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to introduce you to your host of today\u2019s call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Shub Mukherjee. Please go ahead.","Shub Mukherjee","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our third quarter 2018 earnings call. On the call with me today is John Wren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Phil Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer.","We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release. We have posted to www.omnicomgroup.com this morning\u2019s press release along with the presentation, covering the information that we will review this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I have been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially.","I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials. We are going to begin this morning\u2019s call with an overview of our business from John Wren. Then, Phil Angelastro will review our financial results for the quarter. And then we will open up the line for your questions.","John Wren","Thank you, Shub. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call this morning. I am pleased to speak to you this morning about our third quarter 2018 results. It\u2019s been a very busy quarter as we successfully executed many of the repositioning plans and dispositions that we discussed on our last call on July 17. On August 31, we completed the previously announced disposal of Sellbytel. In addition, during the third quarter, we disposed of 18 other companies, which were primarily in our CRM execution and support discipline and to a lesser extent in our CRM consumer experience discipline. These businesses were no longer aligned with our long-term strategy. The disposition activity resulted in a net gain to our P&L in the quarter which Phil will cover during his remarks.","With respect to the company\u2019s results, we reduced headcount by approximately 7,000 people. We also accelerated certain planned cost reduction and real estate consolidation activities in the quarter. During the quarter, we took actions to reduce our staff in our ongoing operations by over 1,400 people with annual payroll of approximately 135 million. These staff actions fell into three general categories. Approximately 500 positions will be replaced as we refresh and upgrade our talent to meet our agency\u2019s current needs. The retirement of a number of senior executives in our networks, practice areas and at Omnicom corporate, these retirements ensure that our succession plans are up-to-date and that we are creating opportunities for upcoming leaders and the savings from the remaining reductions in the headcount will contribute to our goal of offsetting the EBIT loss from the dispositions we completed in the quarter.","During the quarter, we also accelerated our real estate consolidation plans by creating more large open and modern campus style hubs, encouraging greater cross-agency collaboration. This move has resulted in efficiencies by allowing us to vacate more than 400,000 square feet in several cities, including Atlanta, Dallas, New York and London. In addition to discussing the net gain from our disposition activity, Phil will address the repositioning costs we incurred in the quarter associated with the staff and real estate actions. Looking forward we expect that the reduction to our EBIT from the dispositions we completed will be substantially offset by savings achieved from our cost reduction and real estate consolidation actions. We continued to evaluate the portfolio of businesses to identify areas for investment and acquisition opportunities as well as to identify non-strategic or underperforming businesses or potential disposition.","Turning now to our third quarter results, prior to the end of the second quarter we began to hold discussions with interested buyers and the managers of many of the companies we disposed during the third quarter. As you would expect given the activity related to preparing for the dispositions the managers for these businesses were distracted causing a decline in the performance of these businesses during the quarter, the impact of the dispositions reduced overall organic growth by 0.40% in the quarter and reduced organic growth in the U.S. by 0.60% in the quarter. Assuming all of our third quarter dispositions had occurred on July 1 we had total organic growth of 3.3% for the quarter and 1.2% in the U.S. for the quarter which better reflects the performance of the portfolio companies that we now have.","Third quarter EBIT margin excluding the impact from the net gain from dispositions and the repositioning cost was 12.7%, up 10 basis points versus the same period in 2017 and EPS excluding these same items was up 9.7% to $1.24 per share for the quarter. Looking at our third quarter organic growth across disciplines we had positive results in almost every area of our portfolio. Advertising and media were up 4%, CRM consumer experience was up 5.5%, healthcare was up 2.9% and PR increased 2.4%. CRM execution and support was down 3.6% in the quarter. The majority of our dispositions were in this area. By region the U.S. was up 1.2% in the quarter, CRM consumer experience and healthcare performed very well, advertising and media as well as public relations had positive results. In CRM execution and support was negative.","Looking forward to 2019, we will benefit from some of our recent new business wins which I will discuss later in my remarks. I am cautiously optimistic that our growth in the U.S. will continue to improve. Canada was down 6.4% for the quarter driven by a decline in our media operations as well as weak performance in our advertising agencies. The UK was down 0.30% in the third quarter. CRM consumer experience and PR performed very well while healthcare was also positive. Offsetting this growth were declines primarily in CRM execution and support, particularly in research and field marketing. Overall growth in the euro and non-euro region was very strong at 6.9% led by France, Italy, Spain, Russia and the Czech Republic. Germany had negative growth for the quarter. Asia Pacific third quarter organic growth was up 14% as Australia, China and New Zealand had double digit growth and most of the markets in the region performed well. Latin America increased by almost 2% for the quarter, Mexico and Colombia led the way with middle single-digit growth. Brazil was flat for the quarter. Our smallest region the Middle East and Africa was nominally negative in the quarter.","Looking at our cash flow, in the nine months of 2018 we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow and returned $930 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our use of cash remains unchanged, paying our dividend, pursuing accretive acquisitions and repurchasing shares with the balance of the free cash flow. Lastly, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. We are pleased with our financial performance in third quarter and remain on track to achieve our full year objectives for 2018.","Turning now to our operations, we continued to restructure our organization to keep pace with the structural changes in our industry and the needs of our clients. At the same time, we remain very focused on the areas that differentiate Omnicom from our other competitors. Omnicom houses some of the industry's most iconic brands like BBDO, DDB and TBWA, as well as many others. Our philosophy is that individual agencies driven by strong cultures will continue to exist as incubators of creativity. We are deploying digital data and analytical tools to enhance the delivery of our services from strategy to creative to media to PR and precision marketing, so that we can deliver meaningful personalized messages at scale. Today virtually all of our businesses are improving their services through the utilization of new technologies and data.","And finally, we continue to focus on our agility and being able to offer our services to clients in a manner that is consistent with their go-to-market strategies. This means having a flexible and nimble organization that aligns our people and assets that serve the specific needs of our clients. The actions we took in the quarter that I discussed earlier will further streamline our operations and allow us to act in an even more agile manner. I'm pleased to report that we're in a very strong competitive position. We have remained focused and are making progress on our key strategic objectives, growing and developing our talent while increasing the diversity of our workforce, simplifying our service offering and organization through our new practice area and client matrix structure, making investments in our agencies and acquisitions to expand our capabilities in data analytics and precision marketing, and maintaining a relentless focus on improving our operational efficiencies throughout our entire portfolio.","We\u2019ve made good progress on enhancing our capabilities in digital transformation, data-driven solution and customer-centric services in the third quarter through acquisitions and investments. In July, Omnicom Precision Marketing Group acquired Credera, a full-service management and IT consulting firm with offices in Dallas, Houston and Denver. With a core focus on marTtech and ecommerce platforms, the company deliver solutions that increase consumer engagement and drive sales growth for its clients. Credera with Omnicom Precision Marketing Group\u2019s global presence and leadership in data and analytics creates compelling offering for Omnicom's existing clients and prospects. In August, Clemenger BBDO purchased the majority stake in Levo, a leading marketing services and technology business with offices across Australia and New Zealand.","The company helps its clients expand and transform their organizations by designing and deploying marketing automation and ecommerce platforms. Combined with Clemenger's existing digital and data capabilities, Levo will enable the Group to have one of the most advanced business transformation capabilities in the market. And on October 1, we acquired the media and marketing performance business of United Digital Group in Germany. The business is one of the largest performance marketing providers in the market with a suite of offerings including SEO, SEA, Affiliate Marketing, Social Media Advertising and Digital Analytics. We also continue to invest in our data and analytics platform during the quarter. As I discussed on our last call, we recently launched a people-based precision marketing and insight platform called Omni. Omni is an enterprise-wide platform to connect creative CRM and media across a single audience definition. By the end of the year our goal is to have all of our agencies using Omni to create, plan and execute campaigns for our clients.","Now let me turn to some of our recent new business wins, which reflect the talented people that represent Omnicom every day. In early October Ford named BBDO as its global creative agency. The Ford win reinforces our view that clients continue to recognize the increasing importance and the power of big creative ideas will differentiate customer experiences and transform brands. In naming BBDO as its agency, Ford specifically mentioned the importance to them of world-class creative and that\u2019s what we can deliver. And as was disclosed last week, AT&T\u2019s newly formed Warner Media Group is in the process of consolidating the entirety of its U.S. media business with Hearts and Science. When the consolidation is completed, the agency will handle both the traditional and digital media for all Warner Brothers, HBO and Turner Properties in addition to its existing AT&T relationship. This win is a testament to the confidence that one of our very largest clients as in our people.","We believe our longstanding commitment to hiring and developing the best talent in the industry, is key to our new business success. As a result, we continue to make substantial investments in education from programs that will address new digital technologies and data platforms all the way through our advanced Omnicom University programs for current and future leaders. I am proud that our efforts are paying off as Omnicom was recently recognized by Forbes as one of the world\u2019s best employers in 2018. It is a significant recognition for us and what\u2019s more we are the only advertising and marketing firm on their list. Our dedication to having the best talent in the industry was again recognized by the industry this quarter. After winning big at the Cannes Lions Festival seeing our agencies continue their winning streak at the 2018 Spikes Asia Festival of Creativity was especially gratifying.","Here are a few of the highlights. For the fifth consecutive year, BBDL received the night\u2019s top honor by winning Network of the Year with DDB placing second. DDB Australia was runner up for Agency of the Year and PHD placed third for Media Network of the Year. In total, over 20 Omnicom agencies in 15 countries contributed to nearly 120 Spike awards with work from 40 different clients. I am also very proud that [indiscernible] was honored with the best PR Firm Diversity Initiative at PR Week\u2019s Diversity and Distinction Awards. I am a true believer that more diverse teams create even better work. I want to recognize and thank the people at our agencies for the world-class integrated campaigns, outstanding new business wins and the great work that enable us to deliver these results. In closing, we had good financial performance and made meaningful progress on our strategic and operational initiatives in the third quarter.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the results. Phil?","Phil Angelastro","Thank you, John and good morning. From John\u2019s remarks, you can tell we had a very active third quarter. As our businesses always do, this quarter they continue to focus on responding to our clients\u2019 needs while ensuring that they proactively manage their own cost structures. And as we mentioned and as we expected back in July, during the quarter, we closed on the disposition of Sellbytel, our European-based sale support business. That transaction, along with 18 other smaller dispositions we completed during the third quarter, resulted in a net pre-tax gain of $178 million. In addition, during the quarter, we recorded charges of $149 million for repositioning actions primarily resulting from severance and lease terminations in connection with ongoing efforts to enhance the strategic position and operating effectiveness of our businesses.","Lastly, we recorded additional tax expense of approximately $29 million resulting from adjustments of the provisional amounts originally recorded in connection with the 2017 Tax Act. We will discuss our 2018 results both with and without the impact of the net gain from dispositions, repositioning charges and the tax adjustments in connection with the Tax Act. The non-GAAP adjusted results on Slides 5 through 8 presents our results excluding these items and show how our underlying businesses performed year-on-year on a comparable basis.","For the third quarter, our organic revenue growth was 2.9%. Organic growth was 3.3% for Q3 of 2018 after adjusting to reflect the pro forma impact of third quarter dispositions, which reduced organic growth in the quarter as if they occurred on July 1. FX negatively impacted revenue for the first time since Q2 of 2017. The decrease to our reported revenue for the third quarter was $62 million or 1.7%.","Regarding the impact of our acquisition and disposition activity that John spoke about during his remarks, we completed a number of dispositions during the third quarter, the largest of which was Sellbytel. We also made a pair of acquisitions in the quarter, complement our precision marketing businesses in the U.S. and Australian markets. The net impact of these activities reduced third quarter revenue by about $35 million or 0.90%. Based on activity completed prior to and during the third quarter, the projected reduction in revenue from net dispositions and acquisitions will be approximately 2.5% for the fourth quarter which would result in a net decrease for the full year of 2018 of approximately 2.3%.","And lastly as a reminder, we were required to adopt the FASB\u2019s new revenue recognition standard known as ASC 606 effective at the beginning of this year. The impact of applying the new revenue recognition standard reduced our reported revenue by approximately $17 million or 0.4% in the quarter. As a result our reported revenue decreased marginally to $3.7 billion. I will discuss in more detail the components of the changes in revenue in a few minutes.","Moving to Slide 5, our reported operating profit for the quarter was $502 million, an increase of 6.8% versus last year. Our non-GAAP adjusted operating profit or EBIT which excludes the impact of the net gain from dispositions and the repositioning charges for the quarter increased to $473 million or 0.7%, resulting in an operating margin of 12.7% which was up 10 basis points over our Q3 2017 results. On a reported basis Q3 EBITDA increased 5.9% to $528 million. The non-GAAP adjusted Q3 EBITDA and EBITDA margin amounts were effectively flat with Q3 of last year at just under $500 million and 13.4% respectively. Net interest expense for the quarter was $56.7 million, up $4.3 million versus last year\u2019s third quarter figure and up $4.2 million versus the $52.5 million reported in the second quarter of 2018. Gross interest expense in the quarter was up $4.4 million compared to last year\u2019s Q3, primarily due to the impact of increased rates and interest expense on our floating rate swaps, while interest income in the quarter increased slightly versus the prior year. When compared with Q2 of this year interest expense in the third quarter increased by approximately $3 million due to the increase in interest expense on our floating interest rate swaps and interest income decreased by $1.2 million.","Turning to income taxes, our reported effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.9%. Primary driver of the lower effective rate was the lower U.S. tax rate resulting from the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, which reduced the Federal statutory tax rate to 21% as well as a lower tax rate on the gain from dispositions of subsidiaries in the quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the quarter was partially offset by additional tax expense of $29 million resulting from adjustments to the provisional amounts originally recorded in Q4 of 2017 related to the enactment of tax reform at the end of last year. As of now we expect that our effective tax rate for Q4 of 2018 will be approximately 27% excluding the impact on our 2018 effective tax rate from share-based compensation items which we cannot predict because of the subject to changes in our share price and the impact of future stock option exercises.","Earnings from our affiliates totaled $1 million for the quarter, down slightly versus Q3 of last year. Regarding non-controlling interests in connection with the sale of Sellbytel, part of the gain was allocated to minority shareholders. Excluding the impacts of the gain the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries was $25.5 million, up $2.2 million when compared to Q3 of last year. So for the quarter, our reported net income was $299 million, an increase of $35.3 million. The net impact of the gain on the dispositions, repositioning charges and the additional tax expense recorded in connection with the Tax Act increased our reported net income by $18.2 million. Excluding these items, our non-GAAP net income of the third quarter increased 6.5%, $280.7 million.","Now, turning to Slide 6, net income available for common shareholders for the quarter was $298.9 million, while our non-GAAP adjusted figure was $280.7 million. Our share repurchase activity over the past 12 months decreased our diluted share count for the quarter by 2.9% versus Q3 of last year, 225.9 million shares. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.32 per share, up 16.8% versus Q3 of 2017. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter, excluding the impact of the net gain from dispositions, the repositioning charges and the tax expense adjustments recorded in connection with the Tax Act, was up $0.11 or 9.7% to $1.24 per share. On Slides 3 and 4, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. We have also provided the non-GAAP adjusted presentation for the 9 month results on Slides 7 and 8, which excludes the third quarter items that we identified. Since the year-to-date results are in line with our Q3 performance, I won\u2019t review the year-to-date slides in detail.","Returning to the details of our revenue performance in the third quarter, starting on Slide 9, as we discussed in detail during previous calls this year after a comprehensive review of the impact that new revenue recognition standard would have on our businesses, including detailed reviews of our client compensation arrangements, we determined that the adoption of ASC 606 did not have material impact on our revenue or our operating results. However, ASC 606 did change the timing of the recognition of certain performance incentive provisions included in our client arrangements. Because we adopted the new standard by the modified retrospective method of adoption, prior year results are not comparable.","In the supplemental financial information section in the presentation, we present revenue for the quarter and year-to-date periods for 2018 without the impact of ASC 606. We estimate the impact of applying the new revenue recognition standard, reduced our reported revenue in the third quarter of 2018 by $17 million and by $109 million for the first 9 months of the year, 0.25% and 1.0% for the two periods respectively. The impact on EBIT and our results from operations as well as the balance sheet and cash flow were not material.","Based on our latest projections, for the full year, we are still estimating reduction of revenue of approximately $150 million related to the adoption of ASC 606. Because of the dollar\u2019s continued strengthening over the past year, the FX impact on our reported revenue created a headwind in the third quarter. The impact of changes in currency rates decreased reported revenue by 1.7% or $62 million in revenue for the quarter and the strengthening was widespread. On a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, the dollar strengthened against every one of our major foreign currencies. The largest FX movements in the quarter were from the Brazilian reais, the euro and the Australian dollar.","Looking forward, the currency stay where they currently are. We anticipate that the FX impact will again reduce our reported revenue by approximately 1.5% to 2% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, we are currently estimating that the FX impact will still be slightly positive at about approximately 0.50%. The impact of our recent acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by $35 million in the quarter or 0.9%. We completed the disposition of Sellbytel effective August 31. So, the impact of that disposition is only reflected for the month of September. Similar to Sellbytel, most of the other dispositions were completed late in the third quarter. We also made two acquisitions in the third quarter to strengthen our precision marketing and digital transformation capabilities, Credera, which is based outside of Dallas and Levo which operates in Australia and New Zealand. As a result, we expect the net reduction to revenue from our acquisition and disposition activity of approximately 2.5% to 3% in the fourth quarter and 2.3% for the full year 2018 as well as a reduction of approximately 3% in the first half of 2019.","And finally, our remaining mix by geography and by discipline, organic growth for the third quarter was up 2.9% or $108 million, organic growth was 3.3% for Q3 2018 after adjusting to reflect the pro forma impact of third quarter dispositions, which reduced organic growth in the quarter as if they occurred on July 1. Geographically, Europe and Asia-Pacific regions continued their strong performances. The U.S. was slightly positive by 0.6% or 1.2% after adjusting to reflect the pro forma impact of third quarter dispositions, which also reduced organic growth in the quarter as if they occurred on July 1. From our service disciplines, we once again saw strong results in our CRM consumer experience businesses, while advertising was up in our CRM execution and support businesses for the majority of the Q3 dispositions occurred were down for the quarter.","Slide 11 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the second quarter, the split was 54% for advertising and 46% for marketing services. As for the organic growth by discipline, our advertising discipline was up 4%. Media once again paced the discipline\u2019s organic growth. And while our global and national advertising agencies continue to experience mixed performance, we did see some improvement when compared to earlier quarters this year, including in the U.S. CRM consumer experience was up 5.5% for the quarter. Precision marketing had a very strong quarter, but we also saw solid performance from our experiential agencies. CRM Execution & Support was down 3.6% driven by lackluster performance in the U.S. PR was up 2.3% based by the performance of our UK-based agencies. The healthcare was up 2.9% with positive growth across all regions.","On Slide 12 which details the regional mix of business, you can see during the quarter, split was 54% U.S., 3% for the rest of North America, 10% for the UK, 18% for the rest of Europe, 12% for Asia-Pacific, 3% for Latin America and the rest for the Middle East and Africa markets.","Turning to the details of our performance by region on Slide 13, organic revenue growth in the U.S. was up 0.6% or 1.2% after adjusting to reflect the pro forma impact of third quarter dispositions as if they occurred on July 1, so a positive performance for most of our disciplines. CRM consumer experience led the way, while CRM Execution & Support was the only discipline that decreased domestically. The UK was down slightly at 0.3% and the rest of Europe was up 6.9% organically in the quarter with positive performance across all disciplines. Geographically, France, Italy and Spain continued to turn in strong performances this quarter, while Germany underperformed overall. Organic growth in Europe outside the Eurozone was positive as well. Asia-Pacific region had a very strong quarter, with organic growth over 13% led by Greater China, Australia and New Zealand, which all had double-digit organic growth this quarter, while Japan was once again down in the quarter.","Latin America had organic growth of 1.7% in the quarter. As has been the pattern, Brazil after a positive second quarter returned to slightly negative organic growth and was down about 1%. Offsetting Brazil, we continue to see positive performance from our agencies in Colombia and Mexico and Middle East and Africa, which is our smallest region, was down slightly for the quarter.","Turning to Slide 14, we present our mix of revenue on our clients\u2019 industry sector. In comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2018 to 2017, you can see there were some minor shifts in the distribution of our client revenue by industry, but nothing particularly significant.","Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 15, you can see that in the first half of the year, we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow, including changes in working capital, the first 9 months of 2018 and excluding the proceeds of $308 million from the dispositions of businesses in Q3. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 16, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $414 million, dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders were $105 million. Capital expenditures increased by about 7% to $116 million. We reconfigure our real estate footprint to be more efficient. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled just under $432 million primarily as a result of increased acquisition activity this year and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $518 million in line with the first three quarters of last year. All-in, we have spent our free cash flow by about $450 million year-to-date.","Turning to Slide 17, regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt is just a shade under $4.9 billion. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.76 billion, down $350 million from this time last year and up $1.9 billion compared to year end December 31, 2017. Over the first 9 months of the year, the increase in net debt was a result of typical uses of working capital that historically occur as we progress through the year. The use of our cash in excess of free cash flow of approximately $450 million, which excludes the impact of the cash received on our Q3 dispositions and the decrease in our cash balance related to the effect of exchange rates, which reduced the cash on our 9\/30\/2018 balance sheet by approximately $150 million. As for our debt ratios, they remain solid. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.0x and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.1x, while our interest coverage ratio was 10.2x down due to the increase in interest expense over the past year.","On Slide 18, you can see we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio, 20.6%, while our return on equity was 48.2%.","And finally on Slide 20, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10 plus years. The line on top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2008 through September 30, 2018, which totaled $10.9 billion. And the bar show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period was $11.5 billion, resulting in a cumulative payout ratio well in excess of 100% over the last decade.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we are going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much. Nice to see some improvement in U.S. organic growth in the quarter. I know you spent a lot of time talking about the dispositions and the repositioning, but I am curious if there were other drivers for the better growth that you saw in the U.S. in terms of are you seeing a pickup in some client spending, is the new business maybe more of a tailwind in the quarter than it\u2019s been the headwind, I mean I guess anymore color you can give us on the changes sort of gives the confidence that the type of repositioning we are seeing the underlying business getting a little bit better?","John Wren","Yes. Alexia, we have cycled through number of count losses from over a year ago. A lot of clients are in fact spending, not huge sums more, but they are spending money and I think that\u2019s the trend that will continue as we go forward. And new business I mean we have been very successful just at the end of this quarter which is going to benefit 2019 greatly. We are still waiting a few more pitches which will be big contributors if successful with regard to those and those are supposed to get announced in November sometime. Though I am feeling good about the business, we have a lot of work to do. We are feeling good about it.","Alexia Quadrani","And then on the \u2013 I think the press report said that the Ford business may come online as soon as November that seems a little early for me, I know transition usually take longer, do you think you will see any \u2013 you don\u2019t address Ford directly, but do you think you will see any of the benefits of the recent wins in general benefit Q4 or they are really 2019 like you mentioned and then I have a quick follow-up for Phil?","John Wren","Yes. I don\u2019t know what information the reporter had been reporting what the reported did, but I am expecting the contribution to revenue in 2019 from those particular wins.","Alexia Quadrani","Okay. Thank you. And then just Phil, just a question on the restructuring charges or severance expense, I know you said you continue to evaluate your business and you are constantly repositioning and looking at it, should we assume further charges in the fourth quarter or do you think this is sort of a particularly big quarter in terms of these expenses flowing through and you won\u2019t necessarily foresee them coming in the next quarter?","Phil Angelastro","We would this quarter I think we view as have a lot more activity for sure than we typically do. The numbers, severance number that is essentially carved out in the non-GAAP column is the incremental severance number. So we typically expect to have and do have severance every quarter. Essentially that numbers in excess of our average severance, average quarterly severance that we have had in the last couple years, that\u2019s in the $20 million or $20 million to $25 million range every quarter, so that numbers in excess of the average, it\u2019s just the incremental amount. I think going forward as a business it\u2019s always been continued to part of our business, it\u2019s turn over, it\u2019s changing our talent, etcetera. But certainly this quarter was much more extensive than our second quarter.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Phil Angelastro","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research. Please go ahead.","Craig Huber","Yes. Hi, thank you very much. Let me start with in Europe if I could please, you mentioned that Germany was down, I was wondering if that was client specific or more economics from your balance sheet point. And then also can just touch on the UK slightly down than second quarter, was that more economics driven uncertainty on Brexit and I have couple of follow-ons? Thank you.","Phil Angelastro","I think you know I will take Germany first. So no we don\u2019t see there is a broad economic issue in Germany in terms of what\u2019s happened in the last couple of quarters actually. But I think Germany was on \u2013 our businesses in Germany were on a good run for quite a long time with quite a good growth rate. And I think that was just kind of natural slowdown there have been a couple of client losses, couple of businesses that have struggled that we have been working with through our networks and local management teams. So I think Germany itself in terms of our performance hasn\u2019t been I wouldn\u2019t chalk it up to the German economy slowing as opposed to the businesses that we have got and the client portfolios to be regenerated a bit and we are working with them to do that.","John Wren","Similarly, with the UK, the clients that we have had there were pretty specific to businesses that we have and they are no longer real mainstream businesses. We have a standalone research business that declined and we have pretty expensive field marketing operations still up in Northern England [ph]. And there was a slight decline in those that\u2019s what contributed to that, didn\u2019t have anything to do with the baseline economy.","Craig Huber","And then also John in the U.S., I guess making the adjustments you had the two dispositions done at the beginning of the quarter, you will be up 1.2% in the quarter we just finished here, when you think about that versus the U.S. economy, it seems like you probably grew 4% again third quarter I guess we will find out in a couple of weeks for sure and you add maybe a couple of percent for inflation to get to 6%, can you just walk us through in your mind right now why that\u2019s the large gap of 1.2% organic number just based in the U.S. versus what it looks like maybe nominal GDP of about 6% and normally you would be how much closer to align with that is it, I would just like to hear your thoughts around that please? Thanks.","John Wren","Yes. Normally when I start \u2013 in years passed when we compare to GDP we always did that on an annual basis not a quarterly basis. But I think there is a number of reasons that that\u2019s happening. One, there are some structural changes which have occurred in the business which were especially in 2018 been adjusting to. What do I mean, programmatic business that was done by us outside in the past and had a fairly high revenue associated with it. Clients have decided to take that in house. They are doing it. Now we have gone in house with them, in most cases in the case of programmatic. We are still making roughly the same amount of money when you look at profit or EBIT, but the revenue number is different. There were a couple of client losses in the past and recycling through them, what else, some of our non-advertising businesses have individually suffered. Those are the ones that we have been looking at and selecting 18 this quarter that which we sold and there are still one or two more that we weren\u2019t able to complete during the quarter because the buyers didn\u2019t have proper financing. So when that occurs, they will occur, but there is nothing to concern yourself with because there will be some more properties associated with both, that\u2019s about as much of a reconciliations I had in my head.","Craig Huber","John, in your mind do you feel your organic growth that you put up this quarter sort of versus behind you here in the last couple of years or it\u2019s too hard to tell?","John Wren","No. I remain cautiously optimistic, especially again especially as we go into 2019 and my optimism is based primarily on two things \u2013 three things, one is we haven\u2019t lost any large clients, so we are not \u2013 we don\u2019t have any automatic headwinds going into the year. We have had some pretty handsome wins which should start to kick in, in the first quarter of next year. And our clients are \u2013 certainly most of them are not still looking to cut back, but they are looking to invest in their own businesses, so that\u2019s what makes me optimistic.","Craig Huber","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Roch of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julien Roch","Yes, good morning. Thank you very much for taking the question. Look, first one quickly for Phil, could we get the impact of Acuren [ph] on Q3 organic. My second question is do you expect more disposition to be announced next year, John in you introductory remark you said you were still identifying non-strategic underperforming businesses for disposition, but any initial idea on what the impact could be next year on top of the 3% in the first half, are we talking an extra 2, an extra 4? And then the last one is the impact on margin from disposition to the business sold are lower in line or higher margin than the group? Thank you very much.","Phil Angelastro","Sure. So, the impact of acqu in this quarter was \u2013 it was down $7 million in the quarter, most of that was international and the U.S. was basically flat. As far as \u2013 I\u2019ll take the margins and then maybe John want to touch on the disposition. So, we can \u2013 we continue to focus on EBIT dollars not the margin percentage. And I would say that the \u2013 overall, the expectation given dispositions that the revenue base is going to be down in our goal and target is to replace that EBIT through the actions we've taken in the third quarter, you can expect that the percentage will increase. And as a basket I think the smaller \u2013 the smaller dispositions beyond Sellbytel will probably a lower margin than our average and the bigger business was probably equal to or a little bit higher right around our average. So overall, even though we\u2019re focused on the dollars, I think the net result is going to be the percentage would go up.","John Wren","And finally, with respect to dispositions, as I mentioned a minute ago or two that we\u2019d originally identified that didn\u2019t get completed in the third quarter because the buyers didn't have financing in charge, but those conversations continue, they\u2019re not very large, there won\u2019t be much \u2013 they won\u2019t impact the past numbers that Phil gave you. And as we look at the portfolio, there is nothing in the portfolio that I have a burning desire to dispose off. Most of our companies have been streamlined and we\u2019re very happy with their performance or the future performance, but there will always be exceptions that pop up from time-to-time, and when we can get a fair price for companies that we no longer feel are strategic, we\u2019ll act on it.","Phil Angelastro","Yes, I think similar to acquisitions, we don't have a disposition target or bogey that we then have our folks chase around to meet that target. So we\u2019re going to continue to be opportunistic in the future.","Julien Roch","Okay. Thank you very much.","Phil Angelastro","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Stabler","Good morning. A couple for Philip I could. Just going back to the severance numbers he gave us, just want to make sure I got this right. About 1,400 heads, 500 to be replaced, he mentioned $135 million salary run rate. Could you give us a sense of what the total impact after the replacements come in, what the total impact to savings might be for 2019? And then I have one follow-up after that. Thanks, Phil.","Phil Angelastro","So, the savings I would say is going to be impacted by an awful lot of things. Certainly, we expect the net result of this take out some costs because ultimately we\u2019re going to continue to pursue all the efficiency initiatives we've been pursuing, but we\u2019re going to continue to look at what we need to invest to grow the business and some of the new business wins which we\u2019ve recently \u2013 which have recently come in the door are also going to impact what the net savings are going to be. So, we don't have a specific number that we've carved out, there\u2019s still quite a few moving parts to get to the ultimate savings number, but certainly, we've done this because the intention is to lock in those savings and pursue them in the future, we just don't have a quantified number to give you.","Peter Stabler","Okay, great. And then quickly moving on to the commentary around dispositions in the 40 bps of organic growth impact. We understand the distraction issue as you go into negotiations and divestiture. Can you give us a sense though how those divested businesses had been tracking let\u2019s say over the full course of the year, have they been a significant weight on prior quarters as well or was this really an issue where performance really fell off quite abruptly in this quarter and then we didn\u2019t see a similar impact leading up to this? Thank you.","Phil Angelastro","Sure. So, if you took a similar approach to say what are the businesses that we disposed off during 2018, what was their growth while they were part of the portfolio. So for the \u2013 somewhere between six to nine-month period that they were part of the portfolio, they declined as a group probably in a similar fashion to what they did in the third quarter, somewhere I think not quite 40 basis points, but probably closer to 30 basis points. And probably three quarters of that where the vast majority of it impact our U.S. business, probably three quarters of that impacted the U.S. business or came from the U.S. businesses that were disposed in the third quarter.","Peter Stabler","Great. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.","Phil Angelastro","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with ","MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks. So, I have one for John and one for Phil. John, I hear you talk about the acquisitions you\u2019re doing, they\u2019re all a lot more technology-focused, lot more data-driven. Can you talk a bit over time whether these deals come more expensive and less accretive to you in the beginning versus what you may have done prior \u2013 previously? And then for Phil, could you just give us a sense of your philosophy on working capital, I know it\u2019s pretty volatile by quarter, but when the year is all set and done, is working capital still a benefit for you guys or a modest headwind. So, how are you thinking about working capital for a fall of \u201818?","John Wren","Yes. I have to say that we \u2013 to-date we\u2019ve only done accretive acquisitions, and if I\u2019m comparing the price that prices of multiples we pay in 2018 than say 10 years ago, they\u2019ve gone up a little bit, because you\u2019re competing amongst not so much your typical competitors, but there\u2019s a lot of PE money that has been out there. Now as the Fed starts to tighten up some of that money will start to dry up. So, should be at least stable as we move forward.","Phil Angelastro","On the working capital front, I think certainly expect it to continue to benefit to the business. I think there\u2019s no question as we\u2019ve indicated in prior calls, it\u2019s certainly as challenging as it\u2019s ever been or more challenging than it\u2019s ever been. Through the nine months we\u2019re about flat in terms of working capital performance and that\u2019s a hiccup in the most recent quarter, most recent two quarters from some negative performance earlier in the year. But I think neutral to benefit is where we see it going forward, but it does require quite a bit of work.","Michael Nathanson","Okay, thanks, guys.","Phil Angelastro","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just going to be focusing more on acquisitions or continue with the conversation on acquisitions. John, can you put this Credera deal in context for us, is IT consulting, marTtech, strategic focus for the company? How do we think about that shift for you guys either in terms of the competitive set that you are going to battle with every day or the opportunities sort of transform Omnicom from a technology perspective?","John Wren","At this point what we\u2019re doing in that regard is not trying to reform say a sapient that\u2019s not our intention. Our intention is to make sure that we have embedded as employees within the company in the right areas, the skills of any one of the major consulting firms that we can deploy to the benefit of our clients and future clients. That\u2019s really it. And people that are skilled in the transformation of businesses as things will come only more digital as we move forward and people that we are looking to acquire are established people with their own reputations in the marketplace.","Phil Angelastro","Certainly complementary as opposed to \u2013 we don\u2019t think we have a skills gap at all. We are looking to supplement and complement the businesses and disciplines and services that we currently provide our clients.","Ben Swinburne","Is there a pipeline for more deals like this and does this \u2013 if you were to execute more of these kind of acquisitions, does it expand the kind of pitches that you guys are kind of business you can go after?","John Wren","Well. Yes, we do have a list, no I am not giving it to you over the phone. And it certainly is complimentary to other skills that we have within the company as we talk to our various clients, close to 5,000 and their challenges in transforming their businesses.","Phil Angelastro","We don\u2019t see ourselves being excluded from currently or in the future key pitches at our largest clients and largest prospects because we don\u2019t have the capabilities and we are looking to fill them. I don\u2019t think we view it that way and are looking at the acquisition pipeline to kind of fill that gap.","Ben Swinburne","Okay. And then let me just one last one this has been a pretty active year \u2013 2 years for you guys on the disposition front, you mentioned management or talent distraction, do you feel like you have had a broader impact from all of the reshuffling of that I think over the last 2 years we are looking at almost $1 billion of dispositions for the organization, has that something that you think you have been able to manage through more broadly or has that created uncertainty that may have weighed on performance outside of the stuff that you have actually disposed?","John Wren","I am pretty certain that it hasn\u2019t disrupted in any way our mainline business that we are keeping. As I go through all the things we have disposed they weren\u2019t part of our main skill sets that really are at the core of what Omnicom is and each one of them has been a standalone type of operation. So you are not impacting the managements at our subsidiary level.","Phil Angelastro","And certainly our senior most managers that run our networks and groups have been part of this process with us and part of determination of where we need to invest and where we need to move on.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you.","Phil Angelastro","I think we have run out of time operator since the markets now open. So thank you all for joining the call and we will talk to you again soon.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Good morning. I\u2019m pleased to speak to you this morning about our third quarter results. Organic growth for the quarter was 2.2%. Growth in the United States and several practice areas, core to our business, performed better than our overall results reflect. I\u2019ll provide more color on this in just a few moments.","As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2018, we recorded a net gain from the sale of Sellbytel, offset by charges related to several dispositions and repositioning actions as well as certain 2017 Tax Act provisions. Phil will provide more details during his remarks. My remarks will exclude the impact of these items in comparing Q3 2019 results to Q3 2018. ","Third quarter EBIT margin was 13.1%, an increase of 40 basis points versus the prior year, which was a bit better than our expectations, and EPS for the quarter was up 6.5% to $1.32 per share. Overall, our results continue to demonstrate the consistency and diversity of Omnicom\u2019s operations, our ability to deliver consumer-centric strategic business solutions to our clients, and our best-in-industry creative talent combined with market-leading digital, data and analytical expertise. ","Turning to our organic growth by discipline, advertising and media was up 3.4%. Our advertising and media agencies continue to rapidly evolve their offerings in a manner that has allowed them to remain highly relevant for their clients. Healthcare had another very strong quarter with growth of 9.5%. Omnicom health group has some of the top agencies in the world serving the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, and the group is very well positioned for continued growth.","CRM consumer experience, which includes digital and precision marketing, events, branding, and shopper marketing was up 1.8% in the quarter. Our precision marketing and digital agencies had high-single-digital growth in the quarter. This growth was offset by a reduction in project revenues in our events and shopper agencies. As expected, CRM execution and support was down 1.5%. Within this group, field marketing performed well in the quarter, while the not-for-profit specialty production and merchandising and point of sale businesses had negative growth. ","Finally, PR was down 3.8% in the quarter. While some areas of PR faced difficult comps, our PR business underperformed. We are committing significant resources to improving the operations in our PR group.","Looking at our performance by geography, the U.S. was up 2.7% in the quarter. Our advertising and media, healthcare and CRM experience business performed very well, and as a whole had mid-single-digit growth. This growth was offset by weak results in CRM execution and support, which we had expected and had discussed in past calls, and our PR business declined more than we expected. ","Beyond the United States, the North American region, primarily consisting of Canada, was up 2.7% in the quarter. The U.K. was up 3%. Our agencies in the U.K. had very strong results across advertising and media and healthcare, partially offset by declines in CRM consumer experience and CRM execution and support. ","Overall growth in the euro and non-euro regions was 1.6%. In the euro markets, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain performed well. France had negative growth as it continued to be impacted by the loss of a specialty print production client, and our events business also had negative performance due to difficult comps. The non-euro markets overall performed quite well, led by the Czech Republic, Poland, and Russia. ","Asia Pacific organic growth was 0.4%. India, Japan, and New Zealand had double-digit growth. Australia and China were negative in the quarter. ","Latin America was up 6.6%. With the exception of Colombia, all of the countries in Latin America performed well in the quarter.","Our smallest region, the Middle East and Africa, was down 4.5%, primarily due to weak performance in South Africa.","Looking at our cash flow in the nine months of 2019, we generated just over $1.2 billion in free cash flow and returned approximately $960 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our use of cash remains unchanged: paying our dividend, pursuing accretive acquisitions, and repurchasing shares with the balance of our free cash flow. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong.","Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our financial performance in this quarter and remain on track to achieve our full-year targets of 2019.","Turning now to our strategy and operations, I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019re in a very strong competitive position. We\u2019ve remained focused on our key strategic objectives that have served us well. These strategies are centered around hiring and retaining the best talent, driving organic growth by evolving our service offerings, improving operational efficiencies, and investing in areas of growth. As part of this process, we are continually making internal investments in our agencies across all of our practice areas as well as pursuing acquisitions particularly in the areas of data analytics, digital transformation, precision marketing, and healthcare. ","Over the past few quarters, we have made good progress on enhancing our capabilities in digital transformation, machine learning, and audience-centric services. In the third quarter, Omnicom Precision Marketing Group, which manages our CRM and digital agencies, acquired a majority stake in Smart Digital. Smart Digital services and technology platforms are used to deliver large-scale, real-time personalization solutions that enable individual brand experiences and increase loyalty across all consumer touch points. It significantly strengthens OPMG\u2019s offerings in decision sciences, automation, and machine learning. ","Smart Digital follows on the heels of the Group\u2019s acquisition of Credera. Credera overlays management consulting and digital transformation on top of OPMG\u2019s existing CRM and digital offerings. In a little more than a year, Credera has helped us forge stronger relationships and partnerships with many of our multinational clients. We have continued to invest in its growth and are currently launching new offices in New York and Chicago.","The acquisitions of Smart Digital and Credera have built upon OPMG\u2019s already strong ability to work with clients from the very beginning of developing a marketing transformation strategy all the way through to campaign execution. These investments in OPMG are fully aligned with our investments in Omni. In order to execute CRM campaigns, OPMG agencies leverage their clients\u2019 first party data and combine it with third-party data available through Omni to create powerful end-to-end individualized customer experience solutions. ","As you are aware, Omni is our world-class, people-based data and analytical service platform. OPMG is one example of where our agencies are using Omni to enhance their offerings using data-driven solutions. Omni\u2019s tools and applications are used by agencies across the group to deliver growth, efficiency, and scale to our clients. In fact, we\u2019re very pleased that our ability to integrate data into the creative process was cited in a recent analysis from leading research and advisory firm, Forrester. When comparing data and technology platforms across the various holding companies, the report states that the Omni platform offers the most creative integration of agency platforms. This advantage was achieved because our investments in Omni were made for the purpose of servicing the specific needs of our agencies and clients. It cannot be achieved simply by buying legacy data platforms that weren\u2019t built with the flexibility required to meet the rapidly changing demands of today\u2019s marketers. ","At Omnicom, creativity is at our core. We were founded by creators and it\u2019s part of our DNA. Omni is used by our creative agencies to employ data-driven insights for developing the most effective marketing and advertising content for clients. While we continue to stress the importance of data analytics and technology, we also realize that they can only take us so far. As I\u2019ve said before, these are tools in service of creativity and content, which is also why it\u2019s critical that all of our agencies, from CRM to creative to media to PR, healthcare, experiential, and shopper leverage Omni. ","To date, we have scaled Omni by training over 4,000 employees worldwide. This training is critical to our strategy because we know a platform is only as good as the people in our agencies who use it. As has been our long-held view, which Forrester eloquently stated in its report, it\u2019s a combination of humans and machines that will give CMOs the data-driven execution they desire and agencies the new capabilities they need to remain relevant.","I now want to highlight a few new business wins that have come organically from existing clients as well as adding new marketers to our roster of clients. In the third quarter, we deepened and expanded our existing engagements with some of the largest clients, including AstraZeneca, Novartis, Wells Fargo, and Unilever, who awarded us two of their product lines: Rexona to BBDO, and Sunsilk to adam&eveDDB. We also won several new client engagements from world-class marketers during the quarter. Kroger, the largest grocer in the United States and the second-largest retailer behind Wal-Mart, named DDB New York as its first ever creative agency of record. OMD won the global Boehringer Ingelheim animal health account, and Aliance [ph] named a number of Omnicom agencies for an integrated offering which will include creative media branding and PR. These results can only be obtained by having the best talent in the industry, who continue to be recognized by winning more of their share of industry awards.","After winning big at the Cannes Lions Festival, seeing our agencies continue their winning streak at the 2019 Spikes Asia Festival of Creativity was especially gratifying. Here are a few highlights from Spikes, which is often referred to as the Cannes of Asia. We had two networks within the top three with BBDO being named Network of the Year for the sixth year in a row and TBWA placing third. BBDO also had a strong performance in the APAC Agency of the Year category with Colenso BBDO coming in first and BBDO Pakistan coming in third. Due to the outstanding work of our agencies, we walked away from the festival with over 120 Spike awards, 12 of which were Grand Prix which translates as the highest honors in over half of the Spike categories.","In summary, we made significant strides in evolving our services, capabilities, and organization to better service our clients and their growing data needs while remaining grounded in our core business, creativity. We\u2019re pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter which continued to reflect the benefits of our strategies. As we move forward in the fourth quarter, I\u2019m confident that we are well positioned to deliver our internal targets for the full year 2019.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the third quarter results. Phil?","Philip Angelastro","Thank you John, and good morning. As John said, we had a solid quarter as our agencies continue to find a good balance between meeting the needs of their clients and managing their cost structures. ","Before I start and as a reminder for comparison purposes, there were a number of items that impacted our prior year third quarter 2018 results. They included a pre-tax gain of $178 million on the disposition of Sellbytel, our European-based sales support business, along with a number of other small transactions; a pre-tax charge of $149 million related to repositioning actions primarily resulting from incremental severance and lease terminations; and additional tax expense of approximately $29 million resulting from adjustments for the provisional amounts originally recorded in connection with the 2017 Tax Act. As we reported last year, the net impact of these items increased our reported Q3 2018 operating profit by $29 million, net income by $18.2 million, and diluted earnings per share by $0.08; therefore, we will present our 2019 results in comparison to 2018 both with and without these items.","The non-GAAP adjusted amounts on Slides 5 through 8 present last year\u2019s results excluding these items and show how our underlying business performed year-on-year on a comparable basis, which we believe is a meaning presentation for investors and is consistent with how management analyzes our 2019 operating performance. ","For the third quarter, organic revenue growth totaled 2.2% or $83 million. The continued strength of the U.S. dollar over the past 12 months created an FX headwind which reduced our reported revenue by $57 million or 1.5%. The reduction in revenue from dispositions made during the last 12 months primarily in our CRM execution and support discipline exceeded revenue from acquisitions in the quarter. As a result, our third quarter revenue was reduced by $117 million or about 3.1%. In total, our reported revenue decreased 2.4% or $3.6 billion in the quarter. We will discuss the drivers of the changes in revenue in more detail in a few minutes. ","Moving to Slide 5, our operating profit, or EBIT for the quarter was $473 million with an operating margin of 13.1%. In comparison to last year\u2019s non-GAAP adjusted results, operating income in total was effectively flat while operating margin was up 40 basis points. Q3 EBITDA was $495 million with a corresponding EBITDA margin of 13.6%, up 20 basis points versus the adjusted 2018 Q3 results. The improvement in margins when compared to last year continued to stem from our ongoing efforts to improve efficiency throughout the organization, particularly in the areas of real estate portfolio management, back office services, procurement, and IT services, as well as the change in business mix resulting from the strategic disposition of several non-core or underperforming agencies over the past year.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $49.3 million, down $7.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2018 and down $900,000 versus Q2 of this year. Most of the decrease was a result of our refinancing activity this quarter; however, the full effect of the resulting decrease to interest expense will not occur until Q4. I\u2019ll summarize the activity for you. ","In early July, we issued \u20ac1 billion of senior notes in two parts. We issued \u20ac500 million of eight-year senior notes due in 2027 at an effective rate of 0.92%, and an additional \u20ac500 million of 12-year euro senior notes due in 2031 at an effective rate of 1.53%. Together, the euro note issuance, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses resulted in net proceeds of $1.1 billion at an average rate of 1.23%. Part of the proceeds were used to retire the $500 million of 6.25% 2019 senior notes came due in mid-July. In addition, we called $400 million of the 4.45% 2020 senior notes for redemption on August 1. ","As a result of the refinancing activities this past quarter, our expected ongoing long-term debt portfolio will be comprised of $4 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated debt and \u20ac1 billion in euro-denominated debt. In addition, with the drop in long-term interest rates we opportunistically settled our fixed floating rate interest rate swaps at a small gain. As a result, our debt portfolio is now 100% fixed rate debt at very attractive rates.","Total third party interest expense for the quarter decreased by $4.7 million when compared to Q3 of 2018. Interest income increased slightly by less than $1 million period over period. Interest expense on our debt decreased $3.9 million versus Q2 of 2019 and was also driven by the refinancing activity in the quarter, while interest income decreased $2.9 million. In Q4, we expect interest expense savings of approximately $9 million from the refinancing activities; however, total interest expense for Q4 and going forward will be subject to the translation of our newly issued euro note interest expense into dollars.","Regarding income taxes, our reported effective tax rate for the third quarter was 26.5% and our year-to-date rate for 2019 now stands at 26%. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter will be a little bit higher, approximately 27%, excluding the impact of share-based compensation items which we cannot predict because they are subject to changes in our share price and the impact of future stock option exercises. ","Earnings from our affiliates totaled $500,000 for the quarter, down slightly versus Q3 of last year, including the effect of FX rates, and the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries was $22 million during the quarter, down $3.5 million versus the adjusted Q3 2018 amount. The gain on the Sellbytel disposition included about $7 million allocated to minority shareholders in Q3 2018. ","For the quarter, after adjusting to exclude the net impact of the gain on the dispositions and repositioning charges and the additional tax expense recorded in connection with the Tax Act of $18.2 million, our net income was $290.2 million, which represented an increase of $9.5 million or 3.4% versus last year\u2019s adjusted non-GAAP amount of $280.7 million. On a reported basis, our net income decreased by $8.7 million year-on-year.","Now turning to Slide 6, our share repurchase activity over the past 12 months decreased our diluted share count for the quarter by 2.9% versus Q3 of last year to 219.4 million shares. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.32 per share, up $0.08 or 6.5% versus our non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.24 in Q3 2018. Since these adjustments added $0.08 to last year\u2019s quarterly diluted EPS, on a reported basis EPS was flat versus Q3 of last year. ","On Slides 3 and 4, we provide the summary P&L, EPS, and other information for the year-to-date period. We\u2019ve also provided the non-GAAP adjusted presentations for the nine months results on Slides 7 and 8, which also excludes the third quarter items that we separately reported last year. Since the year-to-date results are in line with our Q3 performance, I will just give you a few highlights. ","Organic revenue growth was 2.5% during the first nine months of the year and in line with our expectations. FX translation decreased revenue by 2.5% and the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions reduced revenue by 3.5%. For the year-to-date period, reported revenue totaled $10.8 billion, a decrease of 3.5% compared to the first nine months of 2018. EBIT totaled a little under $1.5 billion and our year-to-date operating margin of 13.6% was up 40 basis points when compared to last year\u2019s adjusted nine-month numbers. On a reported basis, EBIT margin was up 20 basis points and our nine-month diluted EPS was $4.17 per share, up $0.19 or 4.8% versus the adjusted diluted EPS of $3.98 and up $0.11 compared to the amount reported of $4.06.","Returning to the details of our revenue performance in the third quarter, starting on Slide 9, because of the dollar\u2019s continued strength in the third quarter, the FX impact on our reported revenue again created a headwind to our quarterly performance. The impact of changes in currency rates decreased reported revenue by 1.5%, $57 million in revenue for the quarter. The impact was once again widespread. On a year-over-year basis, the dollar strengthened against most every one of our major foreign currencies, except the Japanese yen and the Russian ruble. ","The largest FX movements in the quarter continue to result from changes in the dollar compared to the euro, the U.K. pound, and the Australian dollar. Looking forward, if currencies stay where they currently are, we anticipate that the FX impact will again reduce our reported revenue by approximately 1.5% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, we\u2019re currently estimating that the FX impact will be negative by approximately 2.25%.","The impact of our recent acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by $117 million in the quarter, or 3.1%. As we have mentioned, we completed the disposition of Sellbytel, our European-based sales support business, at the end of August 2018, so we have now cycled through the impact of that disposition. During the quarter, we acquired Smart Digital, a marketing technology agency based in Germany and welcome addition to our best-in-class precision marketing and digital transformation capabilities. Based on transactions completed to date, we estimate the impact of our acquisition activity net of dispositions will be a net negative of about 1.5% for the fourth quarter, resulting in a net negative impact of 3% for all of 2019.","Finally, while remaining mixed by geography and by discipline, our organic growth for the third quarter was up 2.2% or $83 million. Geographically, our strongest performance was from our agencies based in the U.S., the U.K., Japan and Spain. Regarding our disciplines, our healthcare and advertising disciplines had solid performances and our CRM consumer experience discipline also performed well, while our PR and CRM execution and support disciplines lagged. ","Slide 10 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the third quarter, the split was 56% for advertising and 44% for marketing services. As for their organic growth by discipline, advertising was up 3.4%. Our media businesses and advertising agencies continued to deliver solid performances, particularly domestically and in the U.K.","CRM consumer experience was up 1.8% for the quarter. Once again, precision marketing had a very strong quarter, offsetting slightly sluggish performance elsewhere in the discipline which faced difficult comparisons to the prior year, especially in our branding businesses, while CRM execution and support was down 1.5%. PR, while mixed by market, was down 3.8%, and healthcare continued to turn in a very strong performance, up 9.5%. Once again, we saw solid growth across our agencies and the geographies they operate in.","On Slide 11, which details the regional mix of business, you can see during the quarter the split was 55% in the U.S., 3% for the rest of North America, 10% for the U.K., 17% for the euro zone and the rest of Europe, 12% for Asia Pacific, with the remaining 5% split between our Latin America and Middle East and Africa markets. ","Turning to the details of our performance by region on Slide 12, organic revenue growth in the third quarter in the U.S. was 2.7%, led by our advertising and media agencies and our healthcare and precision marketing agencies. Partially offsetting this was the performance of our PR agencies as well as our CRM execution and support agencies, including our not-for-profit and merchandising and point of sale agencies. Our other North American businesses were up 2.7% with media driving the organic growth.","The U.K. was positive again this quarter, up 3% driven by strong performance from our advertising, media and healthcare agencies. The rest of Europe was up 1.6% organically in the quarter. The performance remains decidedly mixed by market and by discipline.","In the euro zone, our strongest markets were Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. Germany was slightly positive in the quarter while France, driven by weak performance in our CRM execution and support businesses locally, once again lagged. Our organic growth in Europe outside the euro zone continues to be positive across most markets. ","Several of our largest markets in Asia Pacific are facing difficult comps versus Q3 of 2018, when the region\u2019s organic growth was in excess of 14%. Organic growth this quarter was a modest 4\/10ths of a percent. Our Greater China agencies were down mainly due to decreases at our media agencies. As was the case in the second quarter, China was facing a difficult comparison to Q3 of 2018 when its growth was also double digits. Elsewhere in the region, we saw strong performance from our agencies in India, Japan and New Zealand.","Latin America was up 6.6% organically in the quarter. Mexico and Chile were positive, while Colombia was down organically. Brazil had positive organic growth but our businesses there continue to encounter significant macroeconomic issues. ","Lastly, the Middle East and Africa, which is our smallest region, was down for the quarter.","Turning to Slide 13, we present our mix of revenue by our clients\u2019 industry sectors. In comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2019 to 2018, we continue to see a small shift in our mix primarily as a result of the reduction of the contribution from our technology clients resulting from the Sellbytel disposition. ","Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 14, you can see that in the first nine months of the year, we generated just over $1.2 billion of free cash flow excluding changes in working capital for the first nine months of 2019. As for the primary uses of that cash on Slide 15, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $423 million, up slightly versus the first nine months of the last year. As you recall, we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.05 per share effective with April\u2019s payment. The increase in the cash payment was partially offset by a reduction in common shares over the past 12 months. Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders totaled $72 million.","Capital expenditures were $77 million year-to-date, down compared to 2018 due to less leasehold improvement activity this year as well as an increase in our equipment leasing program. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled $76 million, down when compared to last year when we executed on several acquisitions. Stock repurchases net of proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans increased to $540 million. All-in, we generated a little over $20 million in net free cash flow year-to-date.","On Page 16, we present our capital structure as of September 30, which reflects the changes we discussed earlier regarding the refinancing actions we took in the quarter. Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt is just a little over $5.1 billion and our net debt position at the end of the quarter was in line with our expectations at $2.67 billion, down $90 million from this time last year and up $1.4 billion compared to the year end 12\/31\/2018.","Over the first nine months of the year compared to year end, the increase in net debt was primarily the result of the typical uses of working capital that historically occur as we progress through the year. Year-on-year, improvements in net debt are primarily due to improvements in our working capital management. As for our debt ratios, they remain solid. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.2 times and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times. While our interest coverage is 9.6 times, down due to the increase in interest expense and a reduction in reported EBITDA, we anticipate that our refinancing activity will positively impact this ratio going forward.","Finally on Slide 17, you can see we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. The last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio was 23% while our return on equity was 54.6%. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review.","At this point, we are going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi, thank you very much. I guess first off, just maybe for John, any color you can give us on how the advertisers you are always dealing sort of are feeling about the overall outlook? Are they incrementally nervous about the economy or is it more business not more so than usual? Just any update on the tone of business would be great. ","John Wren","I\u2019d suggest that it\u2019s business as usual. There are always macro concerns and they change from quarter to quarter or period to period, but there\u2019s always something out there. Our folks are focused on our clients\u2019 needs, and we don\u2019t see any significant change for them.","Alexia Quadrani","Then on the CRM execution business, it sounds like it\u2019s remaining weak in the U.S., and I think also you mentioned in the U.K. Is that a business that you should ultimately see turning or improving, or is it maybe something that you\u2019re still assessing for potentially picking up more potential divestitures?","John Wren","We\u2019re constantly--that\u2019s the one sector we\u2019ve been focused on over the course, really over the last two and a half years, and we continue to evaluate properties in that particular sector. Many of the companies there are affected by changes in technology, and that has an impact on the growth that we experienced, so that\u2019s something \u2013 having said that, we continue to look at the entire portfolio, but--","Philip Angelastro","Yes, there\u2019s certainly some good businesses in the portfolio and several categories that we think are promising. They may not be on the top of our list of categories that we\u2019re going to actively pursue acquisitions in, but there are parts of the portfolio that we continue to work very hard with management on to improve, and there are other parts of the portfolio that are doing just fine.","Alexia Quadrani","I guess just lastly, just overall in the U.K. with just a little bit of a softening of the otherwise good growth you\u2019ve seen, are you thinking anything sort of Brexit-related or is it just more kind of normal course of business?","John Wren","This quarter, I couldn\u2019t attribute it to Brexit. It\u2019s just some of the events businesses and some things that--projects and timing was off in terms of when they hit.","Philip Angelastro","Yes, we really haven\u2019t seen any negative impacts of Brexit in our businesses at this point. We still certainly with our management teams keep a close eye on what the impacts might be, but nobody knows really when or if, never mind what the impact is going to be on our agencies themselves. But overall, we have a great portfolio of companies in the U.K. and they\u2019ve been doing a great job for quite a while.","Alexia Quadrani","All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Roch from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julien Roch","Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. The first two for John, the last one for Phil. John, are you seeing any slowing in media like Publicis, or was it specific to them because that\u2019s one of the three reasons they said that their organic was poor in Q3, that media was starting to slow? That\u2019s my first question. ","The second one is Q4, in the past you\u2019ve always talked about it as an adjustment quarter. How do you see the adjustment this year - again, business as usual, or will macro make advertisers more nervous? That\u2019s the second one.","Then for Phil, just a housekeeping question on the Accuen impact, and then on the net interest guidance, you said $9 million savings, did you mean quarter on quarter or year on year? Thank you.","John Wren","I haven\u2019t read the Publicis transcript, but our media business continues to perform very well as reflected in our numbers. It\u2019s a very vibrant business and we continue to win our fair share, more than our fair share of accounts.","With respect to the fourth quarter, I think I\u2019ll say something very similar to what I\u2019ve said the last 22 or 23 years of fourth quarters, and that is there\u2019s always unidentified projects in the fourth quarter. They generally in our case start off looking like they\u2019re $200 million around the end of September, and I think all but one of the years, with [indiscernible] with Great Recession, we\u2019ve been able to fill those gaps in through projects and budget releases from clients who might have been holding back as of September 30. So, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic as usual, and our people are very focused on gleaning that revenue.","Philip Angelastro","On your last question, Julien, on net interest expense, the reference was quarter on quarter for Q4. We anticipate savings in 2020 as well, but I think that might vary a little bit for each of the quarters in 2020, based on how much of the benefit we had already achieved. So as we get closer to starting to plan for 2020, we\u2019ll be a little more definitive on what those numbers are as far as an expectation in 2020. ","Julien Roch","And Accuen?","Philip Angelastro","Oh, Accuen is just about flat. I think the number overall was down about $4 million.","Julien Roch","Okay, fantastic. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead. ","Craig Huber","[Indiscernible] question. John, what\u2019s your updated thought right now on the U.S. economy as [indiscernible]?","John Wren","I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a cell phone. You\u2019re breaking up a little bit. Can you please repeat it? ","Craig Huber","Yes, it is a cell phone, I\u2019ll speak a little slower, maybe. What\u2019s your thought, John, on the U.S. economy? Do you feel like that\u2019s holding you back on your organic revenue in the U.S.?","John Wren","I think the U.S. economy is strong. I think, as I said in my remarks, when we look at our core businesses, the ones that we anticipate growth from, they grew very well, mid-single digits. They were dragged down by events and some projects which did not come through in the quarter, and there has been some variance in that business this year, also some impacts in the shopper marketing area which we expect will grow through at some point. Then as Phil was mentioning before in an earlier question, some of the CRM execution businesses were a bit challenged, and as I mentioned in the call, our PR business was challenged this quarter. If that had simply been flat, our reported organic growth would have been a lot higher, so you can do the math simply by looking at our presentation and we\u2019re working on that.","Craig Huber","Also John, could I ask [indiscernible].","John Wren","I\u2019m sorry, Craig--","Philip Angelastro","Yes, we\u2019re having trouble hearing you, Craig.","Craig Huber","I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on. Is there much difference in each of the three months for your organic growth in the third quarter versus that 2.2% overall?","Philip Angelastro","I think I heard that. I think the question was, was there much of a difference month by month in our organic growth?","Craig Huber","Yes.","Philip Angelastro","I think the answer is we don\u2019t really look at it that way. Each month, we don\u2019t do a hard close like we do each quarter and at year-end, so while directionally we certainly are focused on the monthly results that our agencies submit, we\u2019re also looking at their forecasts for full quarter and the year as we review the results with the companies, because the timing might vary month by month of when a project was completed or how the month played out versus last year, so we\u2019re really focused on the quarterly results and the full year.","I don\u2019t think I would say there was anything significantly different month by month or year on year relative to each month in terms of how we look at the business.","Craig Huber","But another question, if you can hear me, for the consumer packaged goods clients -CPG, are you seeing any stabilization there with the revenues?","Philip Angelastro","I think in our case, CPG relative to some of our competitors is not as large a component of our portfolio of clients, and I think our results are probably mixed with our CPG clients. Some of them have in fact--some of our revenues have in fact come down, and some of our revenues on other clients in the CPG space have gone up a bit, so I think it\u2019s probably a mixed performance for us as opposed to one overall trend for all of our clients in that space.","John Wren","The only thing I would add to that, Craig, is we\u2019ve been fortunate to be winning business in that category. As I mentioned in my comments, Unilever signed two of its previous brands to us just recently, so net-net-net, we\u2019re okay.","Philip Angelastro","Thanks Craig.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen","Hi, thanks. A couple things, please. First off, can you remind us, maybe Phil, what the timing is on rolling off of the effect of the dispositions? It looks like the effect is slowing into Q4 with less of a negative impact. Do you cycle through that as of Q1? Relatedly, is there any impact on the organic growth that you could call out as it refers to that, i.e. has them coming off this year helped raise your organic growth a little bit this year? ","Secondly and more broadly strategically on the data driven businesses, the digital transformation businesses you talked about, you\u2019ve mostly built these and you\u2019ve talked about these quite a bit the last few quarters. You\u2019ve now referred to a couple of acquisitions, I guess they\u2019re relatively small. I just wonder if there\u2019s any shift in strategy towards more acquisitions in this space and if you could comment, maybe, on where you see this line of business going. You\u2019re talking a bit more about IT, a bit more about consulting. What kind of work may be emerging in this area? Thanks. ","Philip Angelastro","Sure. I\u2019ll start with the dispositions and then I\u2019ll pass your second question onto John. As far as the impact in 2020 and 4Q19, 4Q19 I think in our prepared remarks, we said we expect dispositions to outweigh acquisitions by about 1.5%, so 1.5% negative in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter based on dispositions and acquisitions we\u2019ve completed to date and in the past, the first quarter we expect probably is going to be somewhere around negative 0.5% and after that, it kind of flattens out. Our expectation is similar to our strategy that we\u2019ve been pursuing pretty consistently, we\u2019re going to continue to try and find accretive acquisitions and as many as we can find that are in line with our criteria in terms of it being a good fit with our existing portfolio of businesses and\/or clients, it\u2019s on strategy, and the pricing is fairly reasonable. We\u2019re going to pursue those acquisitions and if we can do more, we want to do more.","The expectation, though, is--or the number is just based on what we\u2019ve completed to date. Our expectation is we\u2019re going to continue to pursue those acquisitions and the goal would be for that number to turn positive again.","In terms of just the second part of that question, the impact of those dispositions on our organic growth in the quarter in \u201919, I\u2019d say it really hasn\u2019t impacted our organic growth one way or the other in a meaningful way. There might have been a little bit of a benefit, but not meaningful enough to call it out.","Tim Nollen","Okay.","John Wren","In terms of our focus, I\u2019ll refer you back to my prepared remarks where I said that our primary focus in pursuing acquisitions is in the area of data analytics, digital transformation and precision marketing across most of our practice areas. But to echo Phil\u2019s point, we won\u2019t throw reckless money at things we\u2019re capable of building, so we\u2019re very disciplined about the acquisitions we make. ","Philip Angelastro","Just one last point. I think in terms of some of the deals we completed recently, Credera, which has been with us for a little while now, has really worked out well. It\u2019s been integrated into our precision marketing group and has grown quite nicely. To the extent that, as John said, we can find more deals in the areas that we\u2019re particularly interested in, we\u2019re going to pursue them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you, good morning. Two questions. One, I was curious--John, I know you mentioned you didn\u2019t read or listen to the Publicis call, and I feel bad asking you about someone else\u2019s comments, but one of the things they\u2019ve talked about for a long time has been the impact of attrition in the U.S., sort of in-housing or in-sourcing particularly around media. They\u2019re obviously a large company. I\u2019m just curious if you see that as a trend; if you do, it doesn\u2019t seem to be impacting your financials, so how are you offsetting that, or maybe you just don\u2019t see it as much of a factor in the business as they do. ","Then I just wanted to ask about the Disney win. I know you guys don\u2019t like to talk about specific account wins and losses too much, but that\u2019s a sizeable one. I\u2019m just curious if you could help us think about how incremental that is to the existing Disney business and when we might see that start impacting your results. ","John Wren","Again, I haven\u2019t studied Publicis\u2019 media business. I was a little bit shocked to see it was in decline because earlier in the year, they won a couple of very large accounts. I\u2019m not on the inside of it, so I can\u2019t tell you the answer. They probably have suffered more than we certainly have because of their CPG clients and some of the changes that are happening there, but again I can\u2019t speak for Publicis with any accuracy, so you have to take that comment with a grain of salt. ","The Disney win is very important, but part of that win was business we already had, so it was incremental business that we received but we were able to defend our business very well. We\u2019re very pleased with our relationship there and look forward to it growing as we go forward.","Philip Angelastro","As far as when the transition exactly is going to benefit us, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s going to be any different than any other client situation. There will be a transition period and I think our intention will be to help transition what we don\u2019t have as quickly as we can. A lot of that is based on how quickly the client wants the change to occur.","Ben Swinburne","Maybe just John, as a follow-up, is bringing more and more media in-house a CPG specific trend in your mind, or do you think it\u2019s broader? You mentioned that piece of the puzzle before.","John Wren","I haven\u2019t truly studied it that closely. I mean, technology changes what comes in house and what stays out at an agency. Oftentimes somebody was doing something with us and they decide to in-house, we follow them in-house to help them set up and grow, and that just enhances the relationship. But I think the most dramatic changes that we\u2019ve noticed on in-housing has really been in the CPG area. Others do it, but they do it for a while, some of them do it for a while and then decide that they can\u2019t do it and come back to us. It\u2019s just a constant--","Philip Angelastro","Yes, I mean, clients have been experimenting with in-housing for years. We expect they\u2019ll continue to do so. With your question specifically geared toward media, there are some significant investments required and we made them and we\u2019ve been making them over the last 10-plus years, and they\u2019re not easy to duplicate. In our business, we\u2019ve been looking to do more outsourcing to specialists who can do some of the functions that we\u2019ve been performing internally more efficiently and effectively, so we don\u2019t see this trend as much different than ultimately clients eventually going back to the specialists and the people that have made the necessary investments and that can get the scale and the skills to help them achieve what they\u2019re trying to achieve.","I think given the timing and the market is about to open, we have time for one more call.","Operator","That question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks, appreciate it. I\u2019ll be quick. One for John, one for John and Phil. So John, given the problems that these European competitors of yours have in North America, it\u2019s pretty obvious they\u2019re losing a lot of share here to you. Are you seeing any change in the competitive pressure to either retain talent or on deal terms, or anything that y9ou see happening in the marketplace due to their weakness? ","John Wren","Not that I could call out individually. We have always--in terms of talent, we\u2019re always in search--we think we have the best talent in the industry and we\u2019re always in an effort to acquire more of that better talent. In that regard, there\u2019s a lot of recruiting that goes on within the industry. I don\u2019t know if that quite fully answers your question, but--.","Philip Angelastro","Yes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen dramatic changes in terms of deal terms, and it certainly hasn\u2019t eased if--you know, as a result of our competitors maybe being less active on the acquisition front.","Michael Nathanson","Okay, and then let me ask you both, on dividends versus buybacks, you\u2019ve called out where you\u2019ve financed your long-term paper at - it\u2019s incredibly cheap how low rates are. Is there any internal thinking about maybe positioning more of your capital returns to dividends versus buybacks as time goes on, I guess to make the stock more attractive? Is that a conversation that you guys have entered into at all? ","Philip Angelastro","Dividends are a matter that our board considers on a periodic basis, and it\u2019s something that we certainly discuss a few times a year. The board looks at it very seriously. We certainly want to be as consistent as we can in terms of our dividend policy and our capital allocation policy, and I think we think we\u2019ve certainly done that. I don\u2019t think we have any intentions of changing it in any significant way, but it is more of a board decision.","Michael Nathanson","Okay, thank you.","Philip Angelastro","Thank you all for taking the time to join us on the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"16188":["Omnicom Group, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to introduce you to your host for today's call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Shub Mukherjee. Please go ahead.","Shub Mukherjee - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. On the call with me today is John Wren, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Phil Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer.","We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release. We've posted on our website at www.omnicomgroup.com this morning's press release along with the presentation which covers the information that we will review. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I've been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation. And to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectations, and that actual events or results may differ materially. I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. You can find a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.","We're going to begin this morning's call with an overview of our business from John Wren. Then Phil Angelastro will review our financial results. And then we will open up the line for your questions.","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Shub. Good morning. I'm pleased to speak to you about our fourth quarter and the full year 2015 business results. As you will hear this morning, it was an excellent quarter for Omnicom. We recruited some of the best talent in our industry, continued to win significant new business, and made a couple of important agency acquisitions. It was a terrific way to end the year.","Our financial performance was also solid. We posted organic revenue growth of 4.8% in the fourth quarter resulting in 5.3% growth for the full year. We also achieved our margin and net income targets for the quarter and the full year despite significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar and its impact on revenue and EBIT.","FX reduced our revenue in the fourth quarter by $236 million or 5.6%. For the year, currency impacts reduced our revenue by just over $1 billion. As we enter 2016, FX will continue to be a headwind on our revenue and earnings, but hopefully at a less significant rate. Phil will provide more details about the impact of FX later in the call.","Turning now to organic growth by region, North America increased by 4.7%, reflecting very strong performances in our brand advertising and media businesses. This was offset by a public relations and specialty disciplines, both of which had difficult comps versus prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2014, PR was up 9.9% and specialty was up 8.9%.","The UK. was up 4.9% in the quarter and ended the year up 7.1%. Overall, growth in our Euro region was 3.5%. In the Euro Markets, Germany was in the mid-single digits, and Spain and Italy also outperformed, while France and the Netherlands continued to weigh on the performance in the region. Outside the Euro countries, Russia, Sweden, and Turkey had above average results.","Moving to Asia Pacific, organic growth was 8.6%. We had solid growth across almost every market and double-digit growth in Australia, China, Indonesia, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam. Latin America was slightly positive for the quarter as strong performances in Mexico offset weaknesses in Brazil.","Looking at our bottom line, EPS for the quarter was $1.35, up 3.8% versus the prior year. For the year, EPS was up 4% to $4.41. Excluding the impact of currency, earnings per share would have been 8% higher for both the quarter and the year.","For 2015, we generated over $1.6 billion free cash, an increase of 2% year-over-year and returned almost $1.2 billion to the shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong.","Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance for the quarter and the full year. Looking forward, the consistency and diversity of our operations and results combined with our very strong liquidity and balance sheet will allow us to capitalize on opportunities when they arise.","Turning now to some of the events of last year. As widely reported, 2015 had a significant number of media reviews. As I mentioned on previous calls, we were very selective in accepting only a handful of invitations to pursue new media business and declined a few others in order to stay focused on our existing clients.","And as I'm sure you have seen, we ended the year winning most of Procter & Gamble's North America media planning and buying business which was perhaps the most expensive and certainly the most closely watched review of 2015. This win is a reflection of the talented people and the capabilities we have within Omnicom's Media Group and Annalect, our open-source data and analytics platform. You've heard me talk about the investments we've made in this area and they're paying off for our clients and our business.","We now have data and analytic experts or marketing scientists as we call them, embedded in many of our account teams. Clients increasingly recognize this alignment leads to better data informed strategies that are more effective in today's fluid and personalized marketing environment. Overall we're very pleased with our results on these media reviews for the year as we came out a net winner.","An independent third-party, (7:01), recently reported that we ranked ahead of our main holding company competitors and that includes us passing on some of the pictures I mentioned earlier. Since year-end Sony concluded its global review. OMD adding substantially to its music business and entertainment business while trading off some gaming businesses, principally out of the UK.","Looking ahead, there are also a few mid-sized opportunities and risks that are more typical of a normal review year. Whether the pace of 2015 continues into 2016, it's too early to say. But we will not be surprised if the patterns continue. At the same time, our Media Group is in a process of developing a third global brand in addition to our successful OMD and PHD brands. You can expect our Media Group to announce the official launch of this third media brand in the next few weeks.","In the year ahead, they will be establishing network offices in key markets around the world leveraging other in-country media assets. This'll give us additional capacity to manage more client relationships as well as leverage the investments we've made in media capabilities across our businesses.","Turning to the topic of talent, we announced last quarter that Wendy Clark would become CEO of DDB North America. Wendy is highly respected in the marketing world and joins DDB from Coca-Cola where she was the president for sparkling brands and strategic marketing. We're excited to have her part of the DDB and Omnicom team.","We also had a number of other important recruits in the quarter from leading marketers. These senior talent additions are a testament to Omnicom's ability to attract top people from iconic brands. I mentioned at the beginning of the call that we had made two important acquisitions in the fourth quarter, one in Latin America and one in the UK.","In November, DDB Worldwide announced the acquisition of Grupo ABC, the largest independent advertising and marketing communications group in Brazil. Grupo ABC has 2,000 people in 30 locations with best-in-class advertising brands as well as offerings in public relations, CRM, digital, promotion and events. Their blue-chip client roster includes names like Procter & Gamble, J&J, and Anheuser-Busch InBev. We have known the co-founders of Grupo ABC since we invested in DDB's operation in Brazil in 1997. So I'm especially pleased to officially welcome them back to the Omnicom family.","Importantly, ABC has outstanding creative talent that will strengthen our capabilities, not only in Brazil, but also around the world. And despite its current economic challenges, we're fully committed to the Brazilian market as one of the largest for our services. The ABC acquisition closed at the end of January, and Omnicom's 2016 results will include 11 months of their operations.","In December, BBDO Worldwide acquired a majority stake in Wednesday Agency Group. With over 100 people in London and New York, Wednesday is a leading creative agency focused on fashion and luxury lifestyle bands, a specialized niche in our business. The firm is known for its creative excellence and passion which makes it a great fit for BBDO.","Grupo ABC and Wednesday are perfect examples of agencies founded by leading industry talent with strong creative cultures that also strengthen our geographic and service capability. Another barometer that we use to measure our success in cultivating the best talent is the performance of our work for clients in award shows. Once again, our agencies and networks continue their tradition of being the most creatively awarded companies in the world.","Let me mention just a few just to highlight them. Omnicom swept Campaign Magazine's prestigious 2015 Agency of the Year awards. BBDO was awarded Agency Network of the Year; PHD, Media Network of the Year; and adam&eveDDB picked up Agency of the Year. BBDO topped The Gunn Report for the tenth year in a row. At the campaign Asia-Pacific Agency of the Year awards, TBWA and DDB won Creative Agencies of the Year in Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Philippines and Indonesia. There were many others throughout our disciplines and I want to congratulate all of our people in agencies for their outstanding work.","Operationally, we continue to drive greater efficiencies throughout our business in 2015. We are constantly challenging our people to find ways to manage their costs agency-by-agency. And on a regional and global basis, we're leveraging our scale in areas such as information technology, real estate, back office services and purchasing to deliver further cost improvements. We believe that these and other initiatives will allow Omnicom to deliver a 30 basis point margin improvement for the full year 2016 or 13.7% EBITA versus 13.4% for this past year.","Before I hand the call over to Phil, I want to touch on the importance of innovation and collaboration in our business as we continue moving forward towards more interconnected activities.","In January, I attended the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. I'm always amazed at the pace of technological change, from virtual-reality which has now reached the tipping point, to the Internet-of-Things which is resulting in automation and interconnection of homes, cars, personal devices. Many of these innovations were still in the concept stage just a few years ago and are examples of technologies that will create new opportunities for marketers. For Omnicom and our agencies, it is critical to continue and hire and develop talent and build capabilities to keep pace with these changes, as well as to align our businesses and people in a manner that allows us to best service our clients.","Partnerships will also help drive our success. Partnerships between our clients and agencies, across our different types of agencies and partnerships with companies that complement our capabilities. From shopper marketing to PR, to media, to advertising, to CRM, our agencies are increasingly working together seamlessly on behalf of our clients. They're also collaborating with tech companies, entertainment companies, fashion and design firms to create the innovative award winning work that they're known for.","We believe we are the best-in-class in doing this, and our 2015 performance demonstrated it. Omnicom continued to be an industry leader, strengthening our talent, embracing new technologies and collaborating to deliver outstanding creative work for our clients and their brands. I want to recognize and thank the 74,000 people at our agencies for their world-class integrated campaigns, outstanding new business wins, and all the great work that enabled us to deliver these results.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the fourth quarter and the full year results. Phil?","Philip J. Angelastro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, John, and good morning. During 2015, our businesses continued to focus on meeting the needs of their clients and winning new business, as well as enhancing efficiencies within their organizations to improve their operational profitability.","For the fourth quarter, our organic revenue growth of $200 million or 4.8% once again exceeded our expectations, and capped the year where organic growth was 5.3%. The U.S. continued its strong performance to close out the year with Q4 organic growth of almost 4%, coming off a particularly difficult comp versus last year's Q4 where organic growth was 9%.","Internationally, we again experienced solid growth in all of our regions with strong country performance in the UK. and Canada and across most of our major Asia Pacific markets. Continental Europe was positive, driven by Germany and Spain, while revenues in the Netherlands and France declined. While we continue to have solid organic revenue growth overall, in the fourth quarter, exchange rates continued to create a considerable headwind on our international revenue as almost all foreign currencies again weakened versus the dollar in Q4.","The negative FX impact of 5.6% in Q4 was somewhat lower as a percentage than the previous three quarters of 2015, as the decline in currencies began in the fourth quarter of 2014. Revenue for the quarter after considering a small reduction in revenue from the impact of our dispositions, net of acquisitions, was $4.15 billion, down 1% versus Q4 last year.","We will go over our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes. Now we'll move to EBITA and operating income. EBITA for the fourth quarter of 2015 decreased $5.4 million to $604 million versus $609 million in Q4 of last year. As we've discussed previously, the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currency as their revenue, which operationally serves as a natural hedge. However, in several of our higher-margin markets, including Australia, Canada and Brazil, FX had a relatively larger negative impact this quarter than in previous quarters this year.","However, through our ongoing initiatives, to increase efficiencies throughout the organization, we've enhanced the flexibility in our cost structure. These efforts have allowed us to offset the FX headwind on EBITA. As a result, the EBITA margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 14.5% which was unchanged versus Q4 of last year. Operating income decreased by $3.9 million to $575.5 million for the quarter, which was also negatively impacted by FX. Operating margin of 13.9% was up slightly compared to 13.8% in Q4 of 2014.","Turning now to page two of the presentation. Net interest expense for the quarter was $36.8 million, up $6.8 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014, and up $900,000 from the third quarter of this year. Versus Q4 of last year, the increase in net interest expense related to an increase in rates on our floating rate debt and the termination in Q4 of the floating interest rate swaps on our 2020 senior notes and a portion of the swaps on our 2022 senior notes. This brought our ratio of fixed rate to floating rate debt from 50%-50% to 60% fixed, and 40% floating at year end.","The gain that we realized on the termination of the swaps will be amortized over the life of the debt. The amortization of that gain in Q4 of 2015 was lower than the benefit recorded from the swaps in Q4 of 2014. Additionally, interest income on our cash balances held internationally decreased year-over-year by approximately $1.1 million due to negative FX.","On a constant currency basis interest income was up slightly year-over-year. And versus Q3 of 2015, the increase in net interest expense was the result of a decrease in the interest benefit from terminating our floating interest rate swaps in Q4, partially offset by an increase in interest income from our international treasury centers resulting from our higher than average cash balances in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter.","Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% was in line with the full year tax rate of 2015 and consistent with our projections for the year. Earnings from our affiliates of $2.2 million is down versus last year, which was related to a reduction in the contribution of certain international affiliates, primarily as a result of the negative impact of FX. On a constant dollar basis, our earnings from affiliates was flat.","The allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased nearly $11 million to $32.6 million, while negative FX was the primary reason for the decrease since a large number of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. The decrease was also due to the purchase at the end of the third quarter of one of our larger non-controlling interests of one of our agencies in Latin America. As a result, net income for the quarter was $332 million. That's up $2.1 million or a little less than 1% versus our Q4 results last year.","Turning to slide three, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter, after allocation of $3.3 million of net income to participating securities, which for us was a dividend paying unvested restricted shares held by our employees, was $328.3 million. up slightly from last year. And our diluted share count for the quarter was $243.8 million, that's down 2.4% versus last year which has been driven by our share buyback activity over the last 12 months. The resulting diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.35 per share. an increase of $0.05 or 3.8% versus Q4 of 2014.","On slide four through six, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for fiscal 2015. The brief highlights are as follows. Our full year 2015 organic revenue growth was 5.3%, while the FX headwind decreased revenue by 6.6%. Net of the impact of this year's acquisitions and dispositions which added $15 million, our total revenue was $15.1 billion down 1.2% versus last year. And as was the case with our Q4 results, FX negatively impacted our full year EBITA and margins.","EBITA decreased 1.1% to $2.03 billion, and FX negatively impacted our margin by about 20 basis points for the year, with almost all of the impact coming in the second half of the year. As a result of our ongoing efficiency efforts, we're able to maintain our full year EBITA margin of 13.4% consistent with last year.","Turning to taxes on page five, our effective tax rate for 2015 of 32.8% was in line with our expectations for the year. At this point, we expect our 2016 tax rate to be fairly consistent with the 2015 rate. And on page six, you can see our 2015 diluted EPS was $4.41 per share which is up $0.17 or 4% versus 2014's reported amount of $4.24 per share.","On slide seven, we turn to the discussion of our revenue performance. First, as I mentioned, we saw positive organic growth across all our regions this quarter. Fourth quarter's growth was driven by the performance of our traditional advertising and media disciplines, all our other disciplines a mixed performance across the regions which I'll discuss later. FX continues to be a significant drag on our revenues. On a year-over-year basis, in the fourth quarter, once again the U.S. dollar strengthened against every one of our major foreign currencies. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $236 million or 5.6%.","While the decline in the value of the euro accounted for over one-third of the overall FX reduction, we also saw significant declines related to the Australian and Canadian dollars, the Brazilian real and the British pound as well as the Russian ruble. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we've now seen five consecutive quarters of large negative movements in FX due to currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar. As we enter into 2016, based on our most recent projections and assuming currencies stay where they currently are, FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 3% during the first quarter of 2016 and 2% for the full year 2016.","Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, slightly decreased revenue by $6 million. While we've added businesses both domestically and internationally over the past year, we're continually evaluating our businesses and making strategic dispositions as deemed appropriate. And finally, organic growth was $200 million or 4.8% this quarter. We had another quarter with solid organic growth across all of our major regions with the notable country exceptions being France and the Netherlands which struggled in 2015, and Brazil which continues to face an uncertain economic outlook.","Looking at our disciplines, our traditional media and advertising businesses led the way. The performance of the businesses in our CRM discipline was mixed, with our field marketing and events businesses having a challenging quarter. And although our specialty and public relations disciplines were down organically for the quarter, both of them faced difficult comparatives to last year's Q4 performance when they each achieved organic growth in excess of 8%. Overall, our below-the-line disciplines did not achieve as much of the year end client projects spend as they did in Q4 of 2014.","On slides eight and nine, we present our quarterly regional mix of business. During the quarter, split of revenue was 59% from North America, 10% from the UK., 17% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, with the remainder coming from our Latin America and our Africa and Middle East regions. For the full year, the split was much the same as in the fourth quarter.","In North America, both the U.S. and Canada contributed to another solid performance, with organic revenue growth of 4.7% for the quarter and 5.4% for the full year. Internationally, our UK. agencies continued to perform well across our businesses. The rest of Europe was up 3.5% for the quarter and 3.7% for the year led by Germany and Spain as well as Italy. France was still negative organically and Netherlands continues to lag behind our other major markets in Europe.","Asia Pacific was up 8.6% in the quarter and 7.9% for the year with the major markets again performing well, including China, South Korea, Thailand and Australia with the exception being Hong Kong which was up slightly in the quarter, but down for the year.","In Latin America, our Brazilian agencies had another negative quarter in the face of uncertain economic conditions. But we had strong performance from our agencies elsewhere in the region, in particular Mexico. This resulted in a slightly positive organic growth for the region in Q4, but the region as a whole was negative for the year. And finally our Africa-Middle East region, although relatively small, was up 5% in the quarter driven by a strong performance in South Africa, and the region was up 6.8% for the year.","Slide 10 shows our mix of business. For the quarter, they split 53% advertising services and 47% marketing services with the full year split being similar. As for their performance, our advertising discipline was up 12.6% in the quarter, 9.3% for the year, driven by the outstanding performance of our media businesses across geographies. CRM was down 1.5% in Q4 and for the year had positive growth of 1.9%.","Our field marketing and events businesses had a challenging quarter. Most businesses in the category were up on a full year basis versus 2014 with the exceptions being field marketing and sales promotion which were down for the year. PR was down 6.9% in the quarter and was our only discipline that was down a bit for the full-year, was down by 1.4%. Fourth quarter decrease was due to difficult comp compared to Q4 of 2014 when the PR discipline posted growth of 8.5%.","Specialty communications was down 5.9% in Q4, but up 2.2% for the year. Fourth quarter decrease was due to a difficult comp compared to Q4 of 2014 when the specialty discipline driven by our full service healthcare businesses posted growth of 9.4%. Overall, as I said previously, our below-the-line disciplines did not capture as much year-end client spend as they did in Q4 of 2014.","On slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. In comparing the full year revenue for 2015 to 2014, there was minimal change in the mix of our client revenue by industry.","Turning to our cash flow performance on slide 12, in 2015, we generated over $1.6 billion of free cash flow excluding changes in working capital.","As for our primary uses of cash on slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $497 million, up when compared to last year. Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders totaled $129 million. Capital expenditures for the year were $203 million. Acquisitions including earn-out payments, net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $150 million. And stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $680 million. As a result, we outspent our free cash flow by just under $44 million for the year.","Turning to slide 14, focusing first on our capital structure, our total debt of about $4.6 billion is up about $20 million from this time last year. The increase is primarily due to the change in the fair value of our debt carrying value related to the in-the-money amount of our interest rate swaps at year end 2015.","Our net debt position at the end of the quarter improved to $1.95 billion compared to $2.16 billion at year end 2014. The decrease in our net debt of $209 million over the past 12 months using period end spot rates was driven primarily by positive contribution from operating capital of about $550 million, partially offset by the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balances over the last 12 months, or approximately $265 million, and the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $44 million as well as some other smaller items. As a result, our ratios were strong. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.1 times. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.9 times, and our interest coverage ratio was 12.2 times.","Turning to slide 15, we continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of strategic acquisition and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 21.5%, and our return on equity increased to 41.3%.","And finally on slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 through year-end which totaled $11.1 billion. The bar show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $12 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 108%.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, and thanks for the questions. Two, if I could. First of all, John, I was wondering if you look at your businesses, your segments outside of traditional advertising, and you did call out the difficult comps, but on a full year basis if you look at those segments, organic growth was about, according to our math, 1.2% for the year. So just wondering outside of comps whether there's any sort of mix shift happening within the business. And as you look forward to fiscal 2016, would you expect a more balanced performance across the operating segments?","And then a quick one for Phil: could you let us know what Accuen's contribution in the quarter was? Thanks so much.","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Peter. Below the line, these specialty service businesses that you're referring to are the most numerous within the portfolio of Omnicom. We're constantly looking at that portfolio to find out, gee, are they growing and are they growing in a particular market at a rate that we're satisfied with. And it's a constant evaluation. It's a constant review done by the people here at Omnicom corporate. It's also done by the people at DAS. And unlike most of the advertising and media assignments we have, they tend to be projects. They tend to be projects with existing clients who repeat a certain amount of spending every single year, but it's not as precise and it's not as predictable.","So this year, we were particularly happy with our healthcare companies' growth that they achieved, but also the businesses that they've won, well, particularly critical in a very positive way of some of our PR operations. Some have advanced a lot further than others, and we've been spending the last several months getting everybody up to par. There's no easy answer. It's a constant battle. But I'd say on balance today, we're pretty comfortable with the portfolio in which we're going into next year with or into this year with.","Philip J. Angelastro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And just add to that, your second question, Peter, the contribution in terms of growth from Accuen this quarter was about $45 million.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. David Karnovsky on for Alexia. Can you provide a bit more color on how clients are looking at spending for this year and maybe how that translates into organic growth? We've heard good growth domestically in Q4 has continued into Q1 but don't really have a lot of insight yet into full-year spending plans. And then just how much, if at all, do you think the weak financial markets might influence those spending decisions?","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Phil and I can share this. The world is, as it seems to be reported every single day, the U.S. continues to be strong and the markets that we reported growth are okay, but there are a lot of transition spots and weaker spots around the world. China is in a transition, although its business for us has been good. Brazil, we're expecting weakness and we're expecting the weakness to continue throughout 2016, even despite the Summer Olympics. So when we take a look at organic growth based upon what we've seen, we think 2016 can be very similar to what we experienced in 2015. And if we had to throw a number at it, we'd say it's 3% to 3.5% based upon what we know now.","Philip J. Angelastro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think our expectations heading into the year are somewhat similar. We're certainly not sitting here today as very early in the year, very early in February committing to or I guess implying that the overall growth for 2015 will be the same. I think our expectations are the same sitting here in February of 3% to 3.5% organic. I think for us, we haven't seen a correlation between the discussions our agencies have been having with their clients with respect to what our clients' goals and strategies are in 2016 and what their spending might be at correlation to what's going on in the financial markets.","I think the themes John touched on more broadly as far as the global economic situation and some pockets of uncertainty, those we expect will correlate a little more directly with what our clients ultimately decide to do. From a spending perspective, less so what's going on specifically in the financial markets over the last month or so. And I think time will tell whether the current volatility is a forecast of something that's going to impact the economy more broadly.","David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then can you provide an update on capital returns? I think some investors are maybe surprised at the lack of a dividend increase this past week. Anything we should read into that? And then maybe just your updated thoughts on priority for dividend buyback in general? Thanks.","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Phil, do you want to take it?","Philip J. Angelastro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure. I think from our perspective, we don't expect any change in our capital allocation strategy. I think the dividend as we've said before is a board matter. It's certainly on the board's agenda. I think our expectation is they'll deal with it sometime in the near future at one of the next board meetings, in that their agenda has been a little crowded with plenty of things as it always is, but we expect they'll get back to that evaluation and consideration as it relates specifically to the dividend.","As far as the rest of our strategy, I think our perspective is going into 2016 more of the same. To the extent we can find acquisitions that fit strategically, culturally and pricing makes sense, we're going to continue to look to do more acquisitions rather than less. We expect that activity will pick up. We closed the Grupo ABC deal in the first quarter of 2016. And we've got a pipeline that we continue to pursue. To the extent deals happen, we'll have less free cash to use to buy back shares. To the extent the deals don't happen, we'll continue to deploy the cash through share buybacks as we have pretty consistently.","David Karnovsky - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Roch from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julien Roch - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.","Yes. Hi, there. Thank you for taking the questions. The first one is on the menu reviews from last year, now that we've gone through all of them. John, maybe an assessment of the overall impact of the industry, was it led by pricing, and therefore, will it have a deflationary impact on overall industry growth in 2016? Or was it done on other consideration and have little impact? That's the first question.","The second one is again on the review but on your remark at the beginning of the call that you said that you thought that we potentially might see a similar level, which I guess the market will take negatively if we start to have massive review every year. So if you could give us some idea why you're thinking that that's going to be the case. These are my two questions. Thank you.","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Julien. Our experience was that it's a new environment and with digital being a very much important component of what happens from a media perspective, and also the utilization of data and analytics of making decisions because of all the channels that are out there, so I'd say on balance, in the reviews we've participated in, pricing was not primary. It was really those capabilities, and whether or not the service provider, in this case us, was the correct partner moving into this next period which is very, very \u2013 it's interesting, it's exciting, it's changing very rapidly. And if you don't have the right capabilities, it's very difficult to catch up in a short period of time. So that's what our clients, I believe, were looking at.","I also believe that there are probably some, especially on our wins who actually confirmed that separately and independently in the press. So that's a very strong feeling that I have. So I don't see pricing erosion, certainly not in 2015. My comments in my prepared remarks were such that we have not been informed or been notified of any opportunities or risks, other than a few minor accounts that are currently in review, and we're hopeful that we see a more normal year in 2016 where there aren't as many large media accounts put up for consideration. But at this point, preparing for that would be foolish. We're much better off being prepared to face the similar type of level. So until it's confirmed, I'd ask the market not to read too much into my comment. But we certainly stand ready.","Philip J. Angelastro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think we go into 2016 trying to be prepared for what we wouldn't be surprised if more reviews occur than maybe the pace of reviews two years and prior, I don't think we're sitting here saying it's an expectation or we've got some information directly from either clients or potential targets that would lead us to conclude that it's imminent. But certainly, we want to prepare ourselves and our businesses to be ready to compete on that basis.","And overall the more and more complexity there is in the landscape \u2013 media landscape, the more clients are looking for a provider with what we think we've now demonstrated in some of the wins that we've had, we've got the capabilities, we've got the right people, we've made the right investments. And the more complexity, we think the better off it's ultimately going to be for our business.","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Just one more comment, Julien. The clients that I would categorize as blue-chip clients, we're out there looking for the right partner. There is always clients out there looking for the cheapest price, but you'll find that their business goes into reviews quite often.","Julien Roch - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.","Okay. Very clear. And then maybe a very quick one. Impact of M&A in 2016 on revenue based on the current deal you have closed?","Philip J. Angelastro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think probably right now, we're looking at about $100 million of net acquisition growth, or acquisition growth net of dispositions based on everything we've completed to date. We're going to continue to look to find and close more deals as I said before. And we're always constantly reevaluating our portfolio and making sure we've got the right business mix and the right strategic assets. And if we don't, we're going to look to prune the portfolio of businesses that either aren't on strategy or are not performing to the point where we think that's appropriate to make a disposition.","Julien Roch - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.","Okay. Great. Very clear. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Craig Huber from Huber Research. Please go ahead.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning. It's a lot of concern out there in recent quarters from investors that guys, like Google and Facebook, take much of your business, media side in particular. Could you just comment on that? And this concern seems to come and go over the years, but what's your latest thoughts on that? Why is it not a concern I assume you'll say?","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, our relationships with both of those companies are very strong and they've only improved during 2015. We view them really as a partner, a neutral partner maybe, but they've assisted us in many things. They're not looking to provide many of the services that we provide our clients and we learned to work very well with them in most instances.","I think clients are looking to us to be the neutral partner in evaluating whether or not we use the media that you'd find at Google versus the approach that you'd take at Facebook, and I think that's really \u2013 it's been a question in the past as to whether they were going to be our competitors or going to be an effective media way for us to reach consumers. And I think right today, I'd say it's settling in on them being a partner and clients increasingly depending upon us to do their planning and to do their buying off of their \u2013 whatever platforms are available.","Philip J. Angelastro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We certainly see our clients looking to us to help them make the evaluation across the various media options that they have. Google and Facebook are certainly huge players in the digital space, so they're part of any and every evaluation that we do on behalf of our clients. But I don't think our clients have reached a comfort level or reach a comfort level where they're just willing to turn over a big part of their budget to Google and Facebook directly and feel comfortable that it's going to fit into their overall strategy in a consistent way.","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In recent conversations I've had with one of the two, but it's true both of them, is an early tell I think is to watch their employment numbers. How many people are Google hiring? How many people are Facebook hiring? And what type of people are they hiring? I think in earlier years, there was confusion as to whether they wanted to hire marketers or engineers. I have a very strong impression that as they look at their businesses, they're hiring more and more engineers every day than they are marketers who could potentially compete with us in any way.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Two more quick questions, please. For the fourth quarter, what was your net new business wins? Your future (51:27) goal is usually about $1 billion there. And then also, could you speak quickly about China? Isn't it about 2% of your revenues, I believe. And you said it was up 10%-plus. What's your outlook for growth in that market? It comes up a lot with investors. Thank you.","Philip J. Angelastro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'll take the new business one. So the overall number was probably just shy of $2 billion, but that included a large number on the P&G front. So I think the number from our perspective, although we don't place a great deal of weight on a billings number, a new business billings number, was probably in the neighborhood of what we would typically expect our businesses deliver on a typical quarter.","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And with respect to China, the Chinese market is absolutely changing, but it's still growing at a really decent pace. And our market share in China, we have a lot of headroom. We have a lot of opportunities to win new business, both other multinational companies doing business in China, Chinese multinational companies which are looking to develop their markets in China and they then go outside of China, and in the major markets, the more successful domestic companies. So it's interesting conversation when we discuss what's happening with China and what's the impact of growing 7% in a year versus 5.6% a year. But we still have a lot of work and a lot of opportunity just in gaining market share in that market.","Philip J. Angelastro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think overall, given what's going on comes down to your individual client base. Our clients, the majority of our clients, certainly in our agencies in China, are large multinationals who are trying to grow their business in that market. And we think they tend to be a little bit more stable, and that's just a little bit of a difference in terms of the mix of our business versus some others. And I think overall, it's probably not the worst time to be under-indexed in the Chinese market. Our focus has always been on the quality of the agencies that we have in that marketplace, and agencies that can meet the requirements of our clients in a satisfactory way and it hasn't necessarily been on quantity.","Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Thanks. And I'm pleasantly surprised my question has lasted this long. I wanted to ask about margin expansion in 2016. Very pleased to hear, John, you were talking about 30 basis points of upside. I would assume your foreign exchange numbers of minus 2% negative impact are included in that. I just wonder if you could put a little bit more color onto what goes into the thinking there as you've been basically flat for about four years now. I know you've been investing in Annalect and so on and it's clearly been generating some returns for example with the P&G win, but what other color could you give on the margin expansion outlook regarding revenues, and also regarding costs? Thanks.","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","First of all, I think the 13.7% based upon what I know today is inclusive of the impact of foreign exchange as we know it today. If we repeated \u2013 if we had another $1 billion impact because central banks went crazy, we've talked to you about it during the year, but based upon everything we know and everything that we've told you this morning is that those are our expectations.","The reason for it is \u2013 Phil can chime in -- the revenue growth has been solid and has continued to be solid, but we've been able to take a lot of actions in a lot of programs which take a long time to get started, but once started, we are starting to realize the benefits of the things like real estate. I don't know what else you want to add, Phil.","Philip J. Angelastro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Certainly, we're focused on real estate, technology, back-office administrative costs, and a few other areas. I think John's right, they do take a while to get started. But the goal for us is to make sure that the efficiencies that we implement are sustainable. And that's what we've been pursuing for the last while here, and we're going to continue to pursue it in the future. And although we think we're pretty efficient in all of our operations overall, we know we're going to continue to try and improve in the area of efficiency and effectiveness as it relates to the cost base. And that's certainly the plan.","On the FX front, just to echo what John said, a typical year for us we would expect is plus or minus 1% or 2% in terms of FX impact. And if things continue in that zone, we're certainly comfortable with our current expectations. If things go back beyond that to where we were this year, although it depends on where the FX negatives occur, I think we'll reevaluate it as the changes occur.","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But I wouldn't have said it, Tim, if I didn't believe it.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Can I ask a follow-on which is related, and I understand what you are saying about FX obviously. You mentioned earlier in the comments, John, about you've been recruiting some of the best talent. Just wonder, have you found it easier going or tougher going on recruiting and on wages, given some of your competitors may not be hiring as aggressively if that's true, but on the flip side I would imagine you've got intensifying competition from the Silicon Valley for talent? What can you say about recruiting and pricing?","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, our recruiting efforts have been very specific based upon our company needs and requirements, and we've had people on our list for a long time. And many of my network CEOs, who you don't have the occasion to speak to on a regular basis, have identified these folks have been working very, very hard. Now there's no question that changes in the laws in terms of what people can make at the bottom end of the equation, and as you get more and more of these analytical type of people, I'd say that maybe less creative, more \u2013 highly mass oriented type of folks, you are competing with some other companies that we traditionally haven't competed with. But so far we've been able to obtain and acquire and have joined Omnicom the people that we've looked for now.","Philip J. Angelastro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, certainly more of an ongoing component of the business day to day as opposed to when we get a win, we then start thinking about where do we find these people or we have a need. The businesses start thinking about where do we find these people. I think it's much more embedded in the ongoing business operations.","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And finally, this is an intangible but I believe it really, really counts, and I always have, culture counts. When somebody gets down to making a decision as to where they want to spend their time, the culture of the organization they're moving into is a contributor as well as pay to amazing (1:00:07) decisions people make. So, so far so good. We're happy. We can always use more talented people. Those some extraordinary ones, you can drop me an email, but that's what we're doing.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Philip J. Angelastro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Operator, I think we have time for one more call.","Operator","Okay. That question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Peter Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning, everyone. I'll keep it to one as I know the opening bell is ringing here. John, as you start the third media-buying agency, how are you doing it differently than when if you might have done that say 10 years ago? I'm sure there's lots of industry slang we could use like digital native and things like that, but I'm thinking a little bit more tactically, smaller office footprint, different board chart. But any insights you can offer on how it will be differentiated? I'd appreciate.","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. First, it will be different than if I was doing this in 1996. We have quite a number of hubs out there where we have a lot of talented people that that's what we're going to build around. There are key very important markets where there'll be standalone companies under this new brand, but there will be many other markets that the service level required by the particular client is not the same. And so that becomes an important factor. Plus, what's different today is our platforms for data and analytics are much easier to leverage over geographies than they were in the past.","So that's what we'll be doing. And we'll be leveraging this next network based upon those key markets, and the various capabilities that are required to fully service clients in those markets. So I'd say unlike in OMD you'd find more hubs, other than some of our competitors, you wouldn't have an office say in every single country because we would be able to fulfill our clients' requirements through different means.","Peter Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome","John D. Wren - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thanks everybody for...","Philip J.

Our board of directors, our senior managing team, and I, are confident this will be a seamless transition for Phil, and I\u2019m pleased to have him by my side.","Before getting to the quarter, let me emphasize that Omnicom\u2019s operational and financial strategies remain unchanged. Turning to the quarter, we delivered good results with organic growth up 6.5% over the same quarter last year. Our growth was driven by new business wins in late 2013 and earlier this year, as well as strong performance in some of our core strategic growth areas, which I\u2019ll touch upon in a few minutes.","Year-to-date, our organic growth rate is 5.6%, so we are on track to exceed our target for the full year. On the margin front, we had a slight decrease year-over-year of one-tenth of 1%. In absolute dollars, that difference to flat margins was insignificant, less than $4 million, and the result of several factors. Phil will provide more color on the margins, in his remarks.","At this point, we remain committed to maintaining flat margins year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Even in the face of ongoing challenges in the macroeconomic environment, and increased volatility in currencies.","Turning to our cash flow, we remain committed to our longstanding capital allocation strategy, using our strong cash flow generation to, first, pay dividends. Second, to make acquisitions that are accretive to our shareholders, and lastly, employing the remaining cash to repurchase shares. As you recall, in May we increased our quarterly dividend by 25%. Since 2010, we have increased our quarterly dividend from $0.20 a share to $0.50 a share.","On the acquisition front, during the quarter we acquired The Planning Shop International, a research based consultancy focused on the healthcare Industry, and chosen a full service agency with shopper marketing and promotional capabilities in Turkey. And since we resumed our repurchase program in mid-May, we\u2019ve purchased approximately 11.7 million shares, totaling $830 million.","Our repurchase program will continue in the fourth quarter and for 2015. We continue to be committed to our key strategic and initiatives, which as you know are, attracting, retaining, and developing top talent. Expanding our global footprint and moving into new service areas, building our digital, data and analytical capabilities by investing in our agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies. And delivering big ideas based upon meaningful consumer insights across all marketing communication channels.","Let me now provide some more detail on our revenue. As I said, total organic growth for the quarter was 6.5%, our results were broadly positive across disciplines and geographies with our media business performing very well. About 1.5 % of our total organic growth is due to our programmatic line business, which is included in our media operations.","Recently, there\u2019s been a great deal written about programmatic buying, and there is a lot of client and investor interest in this area. To put it in perspective, we expect for the full year 2014, programmatic buying will be less than 2% of Omnicom\u2019s revenue. So while this area is relatively new and presents good opportunity for growth, and we are very comfortable with our position and investments, it is still small today.","Looking at revenue by geography, North America\u2019s growth was 8.9%, which was driven by continuing strong performance in brand advertising, and specifically our media business as well in PR. In Europe, organic growth was 2.6%, with broadly positive result across the region. The UK was relatively strong, continental Europe was mixed, with the Euro markets slightly negative overall, and the non-Euro markets performing quite well in the quarter.","At this stage, we\u2019re not seeing any significant effect to do the geo-political risk in Eastern Europe, but given the macroeconomic environment, we remain cautious about the region generally.","In Asia, growth was 4.4%, China and India experienced double-digit increases, and Australia also performed well. And in Latin America, Brazil had high single-digit growth, although results were way down by individual agency performance in some of the smaller markets in the region.","Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the performance of our agencies during the quarter, and through the first nine months of the year. Our management teams continue to be focused on executing for our clients, winning new business, and remaining diligent in controlling their costs.","I\u2019d like to now take some time to discuss our data and analytic strategy in more detail. It was a notable quarter for Omnicom, in terms of partnerships with technology companies we signed. We signed a new agreement with both Salesforce and Facebook, these agreements are part of a multiyear effort that began when we founded Annalect, our primary data and analytics product platform, five years ago.","Data and the insights we gather from it provides a foundation that can be leveraged by all of our agencies. Annalect is an Omnicom wide platform that is used by our media, advertising, PRM and PR companies.","Starting in 2009, Annalect began investing in a data managing platform or DMP, to provide our agencies a common set of products to unify and analyze data. Since that date, we\u2019ve invested tens of millions of dollars in the business, and it now has over 15,000 people around the world.","Annalect\u2019s products give us a competitive advantage, both in measurement and in insights, that can be leveraged across all of our businesses. In conjunction with our already existing partnerships, the recent Salesforce and Facebook agreements add more capabilities to our DMP. Saleforce is first priority customer data, will be a particular value to our CRM agencies, as they use Annalect products.","The Facebook deal provides first party social media profile data, linked for the first time, to a specific consumer, and across devices. Securing first party data, increases our ability to target consumers, customize content, and measure results. All of which are increasingly important as advertiser ship for mass marketing to mass personal organization.","One of the primary businesses leveraging Annalect\u2019s products is our programmatic buying operations. This is a rapidly changing area, and we are also evolving our businesses to ensure that we have the capability to service all of our clients. As you know, Accuen is our largest, display mobile and online video programmatic buying unit. It is a performance-based business, which employs people, data, and technology to deliver precise audiences to advertisers.","As a result advertisers who opt in, achieve their desired performance objectives, and greater efficiencies at an all in price, as compared to conventional digital media buyers. We also offer programmatic buying services through our media agencies. Our media agencies use the same underlying technology platforms to offer these services to their clients, although the agency-based operations are a much smaller part of the programmatic revenues.","Programmatic is an important offering for our clients and for Omnicom, due to the expected growth in mobile and online video. Forrester Research recently projected that North American display spend was still a relatively small part of the overall ad market, will almost double to $38 billion by 2019, driven by these areas.","Since the fourth quarter of 2013, due to improvements in audience, data management right from our DMP and our rapid expansion in international markets, we have been seeing a meaningful increase in demand from our clients for our programmatic buying services.","Today we offer these services in more than 30 markets around the world to more than a 1000 advertisers. Overall we are extremely well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity because of our early and ongoing investments while Annalect provides a foundation for data and insights from Omnicom\u2019s agencies it is the talent that these agencies and the collaboration across our companies that allow us to consistently deliver on our strategies.","I\u2019ve spoken many times about the growing importance of collaboration and servicing our clients from providing seamless execution of big creative ideas across disciplines and geographies. As one example of this, you may have seen the campaign for SAP, which was launched yesterday. We won the accounts in July with multiple Omnicom agencies working together to create a simple, powerful brand story for SAP.","Omnicom agencies also continue their tradition of being the most creatively awarded companies in the world, which is a credit to the challenge that we have in place. Let me just mention a few of the highlights from the Spikes advertising Festival, which is considered the Cannes of Asia.","BBDO received the top honor winning network of the year, with DDB placing second. This is the second time in three years that BBDO was named network of the year at Spikes, and Omnicom networks have finished in the top three networks for six consecutive years. PHD won media network of the year, with OMD placing second. DDB\u2019s group in New Zealand was runner up as agency of the year.","All total 40 agencies in 12 countries, contributed to Omnicom\u2019s performance at this year\u2019s Spikes. I want to congratulate all of our people and agencies for their award winning work on behalf of our clients in this very important Asia-Pacific region.","Our investments in talent, technology and partnerships are making a difference for Omnicom and our agencies, they are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these growth areas as the marketing environment becomes increasingly complex.","Before handing the call over to Phil, I once again want to thank the people of our agencies for the world class integrated campaigns outstanding new business wins, and all the great work that has enabled us to continue to deliver strong results for Omnicom, our clients, and our shareholders.","Phil Angelastro","Thank you John and good morning. As John said, I\u2019ve worked closely with him and Randy and the rest of Omnicom senior management team for a long time. And although this is my first earnings call as CFO, I\u2019ve been a part of more than 60 of these calls in my prior role as Controller. I want to start by thanking Randy for all of his guidance and support over the years. I will certainly benefit from it in my new role, and it had helped to prepare me for the transition.","I\u2019ve met many of our stakeholders over the last month. And I look forward to meeting more of you over the next several weeks and months. And now we\u2019ll focus on our results for the quarter. As John said, we are very pleased with the performance of our operating companies. They have continued to deliver against their operating and strategic objectives, while maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients.","Their continued excellent performance has also helped make this an easier transition for me. As a result of the excellent performance of our agencies, revenue for the quarter came in at $3.75 billion up 7.4%. Year-over-year increase was driven by continued strong organic growth of 6.5%, with small contributions to our growth in the quarter, also coming from net acquisitions and FX net.","We\u2019ll review our revenue growth in further detail in a few minutes. A quick note before we review our operating income and the rest of our results. As a reminder we terminated our proposed merger with Publicis in the second quarter of this year. In the third quarter of \u201813 we incurred $28.1 million of cost related to the transaction. These costs are included in our reported GAAP results for 2013.","In reviewing our performance for the quarter, my comments will compare the current quarter to last year\u2019s Q3 results, excluding the impact of the merger related expenses, which you can find in the supplemental non-GAAP information on slides 19 through 25.","Our EBITDA for the quarter increased to $461 million from $433 million, an increase of 6.3% compared to Q3 last year. The resulting EBITDA margin for the quarter was 12.3% down about 10 basis points versus Q3 last year. The slight decline can be attributed to FX impacts and business mix. Keep in mind that a 10 basis point decline is less than $4 million.","Although FX this quarter had a slightly net positive impact on revenue, the increase was largely driven by the strengthening of the British pound against the dollar, compared to the third quarter of 2013. Almost all other major currencies weakened against the dollar this quarter. And in some of our higher margin markets, mainly Russia and Canada, where FX was negative in the quarter, this also negatively impacted our margins.","In addition to the FX impact, our margins were negatively impacted to some extent by our mix of business in the quarter. From the bottom up this quarter, as an offset to the items that negatively impacted our margins, we had solid performance across the portfolio in our efforts to drive efficiencies throughout our organization and our agencies.","Operating income or EBIT performed similarly to EBITDA, increasing $26 million or 6.4% to $434 million. And as was the case with our EBITDA margin, our operating margin of 11.6% was down about 10 basis points versus Q3 2013, due to the items I described earlier.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $31.4 million down $2.3 million from $33.7 million in the second quarter. The decrease in net interest expense versus Q2 was primarily related to the full quarter impact of the fixed to floating interest rate swaps we entered into during the second quarter of this year, related to our 2022 senior notes, versus the last year net interest expense was down $11.4 million in the quarter due to the positive impact of the interest rate swaps, plus benefits from our cash management efforts in the form of increased interest income earned by our international treasury centers.","Our quarterly tax rate of 33.4% is in line with our normal expectations, while we are always looking for ways to improve the efficiency of our tax structure, given where we are currently; we expect our operating tax rate for the year to continue to stay around 33.2%.","Earnings from our affiliates increased $1.5 million in the quarter to $5.8 million. And the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders and our less than fully owned subsidiaries increased to $1.1 million to $29.8 million.","As a result net income was $244 million, that\u2019s an increase of $26.1 million or 12% versus Q3 last year and an increase of 24% compared to the 2013 reported amount. Remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter, after the allocation of $4.3 million of net income to participating securities was $239.5 million, an increase of 12.8% versus the third quarter last year.","You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was $252.4 million, which is down 2.9% versus last year as a result for the resumption in the second quarter our share buyback program.","Given our overall strong performance in the quarter, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.95 an increase of $0.13 or 15.9% versus Q3 2013, are up $0.21 and 28.4% compared to the 2013 reported amount.","In the presentation we also provided the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. To save some time, I\u2019ll just give you a few highlights.","Revenue was up about 5.7% for the nine month, driven predominantly by organic growth, with FX and net positive, an acquisitions are slight negative as we cycled on the disposition of our recruitment marketing business in Q2.","EBITDA increased 4.6% to $1.44 billion, and our EBITDA margin was 13% year-to-date and similar to Q3 it was down about 10 basis points versus the last year. Also included in the current year\u2019s EBITDA amount, there\u2019s a reduction of about $8.8 million from merger related costs incurred earlier in the year.","Now, moving back to the topline revenue performance on slide 7. First with regard to FX, Overall it was net positive, it remains very mixed. On a year-over-year basis the US dollar weakened significantly against the UK pound. However, on a year-over-year basis, the US dollar also strengthened against most other currencies, most notably Canada and Russia, as well as Japan. The net results increased our revenue for the quarter by $13 million, or about four-tenths of a percent.","Looking ahead, if FX rates stay where they are currently, FX could be a negative to revenue by approximately 220 basis points in Q4, and it could also turn negative for the year by over 50 basis points.","Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue by $20 million, as mentioned during last quarter\u2019s call; we\u2019ve now cycled through the Q2 2013 sale of our recruitment marketing business. And our recent acquisitions in the UK, Germany, and Brazil are positively impacting revenue. With the transactions that we have completed through September 30th, we currently expect acquisitions net of dispositions to add about 60 basis points to revenue in the fourth quarter, making the full year acquisition impact about flat.","Organic growth was positive $226 million or 6.5% this quarter. It was a strong quarter with positive growth across most of our major markets, with the exceptions being Canada, Chile, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included continuing excellent performance across our media businesses, especially in the U.S., this is being driven by both new business wins and the continuing development of new media offerings.","Also, in addition to strong performance in the U.S., our agencies in emerging markets continue to perform very well. This quarter we had excellent performance in Brazil, China, India and Mexico, as well as South Africa and the UAE. While businesses in Russia are still performing well, but the rate of growth slowed a little in Q3 relative to prior quarters.","And while remaining uneven by individual market, we continue to see generally good performance in our businesses in the non-Euro markets in Europe, including Poland, Turkey and Sweden. And flat to slightly down performance in our businesses in the Euro markets with the larger French market\u2019s still struggling.","Slide 8 covers our year-to-date results, which are basically in line with the quarter, although net acquisition disposition revenue was marginally negative year-to-date.","Slide 9 shows our mix of business for the quarter, which again is split about evenly between advertising and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 12.5% primarily driven as I mentioned by the excellent performance of our worldwide media businesses.","And marketing services overall was up 1.1%, within marketing services CRM was up 1%, we experienced mixed results in our businesses in the discipline. Our field marketing and sales promotion businesses had strong performances this quarter, offset by weaker performances in some of our events and branding businesses in Europe.","Public relations was up 2.5% reflecting strength in the U.S. and Germany. And specialty communications was down about 10 basis points; however the underlying performance in the quarter remains good, as we were up against difficult comp number from last year on our healthcare businesses, which had year-over-year organic growth nearly 15% in the third quarter of 2013.","On slides 10 and 11, we present our regional mix of business, during the quarter the split of 57% for North America, 28% for Europe, 11% for Asia-Pacific with the remainder split between Latin America and Africa and the Middle East.","Turning to the details on Slide 11, in North America we had organic growth of 8.9% again primarily driven this quarter by the performance of our media and PR businesses. Our other major regions all continue to have positive organic growth as well. Europe was up 2.2%, led by continuing strong performance in the U.K. and solid performance in our other non-Euro markets in Europe. While France and Netherlands continued to struggle.","Asia-Pacific was up 4.4% with strong performances across most of the region with China and India leading the way with double-digit growth. Australia also had a solid quarter and Japan had modest growth. Latin America was up 2.5% led by Brazil and Mexico and offset by weakness in Chile, related to a client specific spending reduction.","And Africa and the Middle East was up 18.1% as mentioned earlier, or be it off a relatively low base, led by a very strong quarter from our businesses in South Africa and the UAE.","On slide 12 we present our mix of business by industry sector, keeping in mind these are the year-to-date figures, the total growth, not just organic growth. The one item of note to mention, the telecom sector is down primarily from the loss of Blackberry.","Turning to our cash flow performance on slide 13, we generated almost $1.125 billion of free cash flow, including changes in working capital during the first nine months for the year. As for our primary uses of cash on slide 14, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $341 million.","This was up significantly from the last year. As a reminder, in 2013 we only made three dividend payments because we paid our normal Q1 dividend in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Additionally this quarter\u2019s dividend payment reflects the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share that was approved by our board earlier this year. Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders were $83 million, capital expenditures of $138 million was up about $15 million from the same period last year, in line with our expectations. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments, net of proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $155 million.","And finally, stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $830 million. As I mentioned earlier, we restarted our share repurchase program in mid-May and so far we have purchased about 11.7 million shares net. As a result, we outspent our free cash flow by about $422 million for the nine months.","Turning to Slide 15, focusing first on our capital structure, as you may be aware in June, we called our last convertible notes for redemption at the end of July. As a result of the redemption, our gross debt position decreased by about $240 million to $3.8 billion as of September 30th.","And our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.96 billion, up about $440 million. The increase on our net debt over the past year was driven in large part by the use of our cash to increase our share buybacks by $220 million. Also to increase our dividend payments by $70 million, as well as the negative impact of FX translation, which was in excess of a $100 million.","Our ratios remain very strong at the end of September, our total debt-to-EBITDA was 1.7 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3 times, due to both a decrease in our interest expense and increase in EBITDA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.0 time.","I should also mention that during the quarter we amended our bank credit facility. Expanding the term of the facility to July 2019, from 2016, or the size of the facility remains unchanged at $2.5 billion.","Turning to slide 16, we continue to successfully build the company for a combination and prudently priced acquisitions, and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our turn-on invested capital increased to 17.2%, return on equity increased to 33.7%.","And finally, on slide 17, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders in 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from fiscal 2004 to September 30th of this year, which totaled $9.7 billion. And the bar show cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividend and net share repurchases, but some of which during the same period, totaled $10.5 billion, our cumulative payout ratio of 108%.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we\u2019ve included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials to be overviewed, but at this point we\u2019re going to ask operator to open the call for question.","Question-And-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operators Instructions) Our first question today comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan, please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JP Morgan","Thank you, thanks very much. Can you let us know how much momentum I think you\u2019re in your programmatic buying business, I mean once you start circling the comps I guess, do you think there\u2019s still going to be great growth in that business, are we just sort of, any sort of color in terms of giving us where we are in this cycle. And also on the margin front, do you think it has a negative impact on overall profitability or less than 2% of revenue\u2019s really not making an impact at this point?","John Wren","Good morning Alexia, I think its early days, with respect to programmatic; we\u2019re just developing the skills and refining them. And the technologies come up really on board in the last 12 \u2013 13 months, which enables us to better target our audiences. If what projections we read, and we\u2019re told by our own media people are true, more and more media will be purchased in this fashion as we get into 2015 and into the future.","We don\u2019t have, at this point, because it\u2019s so new, because these shifts are happening at such a rapid pace, we don\u2019t have an accurate forecast to give you over the phone, as to how fast this business, which is currently 2% of our businesses is going to grow in the fourth quarter and throughout next year. But we\u2019re very comfortable that it\u2019s going to be at least double-digits.","And with respect to margins, I don\u2019t believe you attribute the margin decline of a tenth of a percent, to any one particular item. Phil mentioned a few, and we continue to invest in the very bright people that become available on the marketplace, when they become available on the marketplace. Because we know that they\u2019ll pay huge dividends to our growth in the future.","Phil Angelastro","One thing to add Alexia, we certainly did see an increase in programmatic demand beginning in the fourth quarter of last year, late in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re certainly aware of them this year, but optimistic about the growth in the future.","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JP Morgan","Again John, just one follow up, you\u2019ve got such a great perspective on sort of the overall advertising market. I guess if you could give us your opinion or some color of how advertisers are seeing overall budgets and spending levels, it sounds from everything you\u2019ve said here, and your great results that clearly \u2013 spending seems very healthy. But there\u2019s a bit of nervousness among the investor community, towards the perception on advertisers are kind of abandoning TV and moving to digital. I guess in your opinion, do you think there\u2019s a big, much more notable change this year on that front, or is it more a continuation of a trend we\u2019ve been seeing for a while?","John Wren","I don\u2019t well, First of all, marketing budgets continue to grow, clients though, especially when it comes to TV, there has been, I\u2019d say, a shift there\u2019s like \u2013 when you look at traditional areas, like the upfront and the scatter markets, and you went back a couple of years, there was an urgency on the part of appliance to make certain that they didn\u2019t miss out on the programming that they wanted. With all the various choices of how to reach the audiences you need to reach today, and our ability to do it, there wasn\u2019t that urgency going into the first \u2013 to the upfront this year.","And with respect to the scatter markets, I think you\u2019re seeing money being diverted into other areas. I believe that trend will continue, I don\u2019t think TV\u2019s dead, I just think that there\u2019s going to be a shift. And oddly enough, when you look at it, or when I look at it, as an investor, some of the people from \u2013 a great number of the people that own the content that we\u2019re going to want to be able to use to put online, is part owned by, what you would refer to as the traditional media owners. So they may not get the money out of TV, they may get it out of some other source, but I just see the complexity changing some of the rules that were easy to live by in the past.","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JP Morgan","Alright, thank you very much.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners, please go ahead.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","Yes, good morning, and John if you could just give us your current thoughts I know it\u2019s early here but as you think after 2015 where your, general senses from your clients, what their marketing budgets may look like next year, I have a follow up question too, thank you?","John Wren","Okay, it\u2019s a bit early for me to be giving you forecasts at the moment Craig, our companies, our agencies are in the process of doing that right now. And we\u2019ll be reviewing it with them from; I think it\u2019s probably next Monday, all the way probably through December. My sense is that the United States remains healthy, it\u2019s a good market to be in and I don\u2019t see too much in the way, that\u2019s going to get in the way of slowing down the pace of growth in the States. Once you get outside the United States, there\u2019s a lot of trouble in the world, we don\u2019t have much hope for real economic growth in the Euro for next year.","Again, we haven\u2019t seen it reflected in our budgets, but because we haven\u2019t done that budgeting yet, but the Euro is a concern, certainly after \u2013 although it\u2019s small offers, it remains a concern. Brazil\u2019s had some difficulties, which I think will continue and may impact just a little bit. So we\u2019re pretty balanced and conservative in anticipation of getting the information, but I don\u2019t know how helpful that is. I feel cautiously optimistic; I guess you\u2019d say, it\u2019s certainly still early for us, but the process at our operations and our agencies has begun. In addition of spending some more time with the agencies on Q4 in the next few weeks, we\u2019ll be spending more time on the \u201815 as we go.","One other thing that bodes well for us, and the year\u2019s not over, is we\u2019ve had fewer losses this year, just cycle against next year. So putting currency aside, there\u2019s less headwind as we see the \u2013, but we\u2019re certainly confident that we\u2019re well positioned both in terms of the disciplines we\u2019ve been investing in, in the overall balance in the company.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","And also John, in North America, again revenue growth up 8.9%, it\u2019s obviously quite an acceleration from the first half of this year, the prior three years frankly. What has changed in your mind, in your business, why was up so strong here in North America?","John Wren","As I said, problematic came on board for us, we really \u2013 even though we\u2019ve been investing in it, it came on in earnest in the fourth quarter of last year, so there was a contribution from that that. Again at the end of last year, we had fewer losses than in the same period the prior years is cycled through and we\u2019re up against. And we\u2019ve had a pretty good run this year from a new business point of view, and securing client budgets. So I think it\u2019s a cumulative of all that and probably one or two things I\u2019m forgetting to mention, that has contributed to our growth.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","And then finally Phil, if I could just ask you for \u2013 the UK, you guys mentioned it was relatively strong I guess, in the quarters. I mean organic revenue in the UK was up say 7% to 9% versus a year ago?","Phil Angelastro","I don\u2019t have the number in front of me at the moment, but it was certainly \u2013 give me a second here and we\u2019ll check it, I think that\u2019s probably a good range. Maybe it\u2019s a little on the high side, it\u2019s probably more in the 5 or 6 range this quarter.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital, please go ahead.","David Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hey, thank you very much guys. So I want to follow up on the first question a little bit, that Alexia asked, which is, I know we\u2019re dealing with lot small numbers today. But at what point does that revenue contribution from programmatic need to be before you indicate that it\u2019s moving the toggle and profitability. So the quarter, would you say 10% of our revenue is now coming from programmatic and that\u2019s moving the toggles. Is there some movement like that? And then the second question is, when you look at the data, programmatic business mix. If you look at that kind of 200 basis point\u2019s contribution, how much of that is coming from owned media and the sense that you\u2019re profiting from your owned media, thanks very much?","John Wren","I\u2019d be happy for it to be 10% of a growing business, I\u2019m certain I don\u2019t have those projections in front of me, my media people aren\u2019t signing up for those kinds of numbers yet. I would imagine it will take that level of contribution before it starts to impact the rest of Omnicom, because the rest of Omnicom is so large. Don\u2019t know if I\u2019m answering your question exactly, but if not \u2013","David Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","So quite a ways away before it\u2019s a toggle on margin?","John Wren","Yes I think so, in any meaningful fashion, because the company is so large. We run a business on the \u2013","David Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","I was just \u2013 on the owned media contribution?","John Wren","Yeah, I mean if you\u2019re comparing us to say, what Xaxis claims it does, we haven\u2019t gone out yet and looked for non-Omnicom clients, nor gone out and purchased inventory in any meaningful fashion. We\u2019re studying what they\u2019re doing, and when I also listen to them, and I listen as carefully as I can, they claim to have a significant business in Xaxis in Europe, much more significant than ours. I view that as a huge opportunity that we have to sort through and because there\u2019s no reason to believe that we can\u2019t be impact full there as well.","Yeah I think we \u2013, it\u2019s early days, so we\u2019ve certainly been exploring a number of different approaches, but we\u2019re only occasional \u2013 we\u2019ve only occasionally, opportunistically moved forward on \u2013","David Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","I\u2019d just like to \u2013. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to the line of William Bird with FBR. Please go ahead.","William Bird \u2013 FBR","Thank you. Thanks for the additional detail on margins, Phil, when you referred to the negative impact of mix, what areas specifically are you referring to? And then on programmatic, are the margins for that business any lower than your other businesses?","Phil Angelastro","Can you repeat the second part Bill?","William Bird \u2013 FBR","Sure, how does the margin profile look like for programmatic, is it at the average or is it below?","Phil Angelastro","I think we\u2019ve got a limited history with Accuen at this point, it\u2019s relatively new, it\u2019s obviously rapidly growing. We\u2019ve been making some significant investments over the last few years here. We expect it\u2019s going to achieve margin levels over time, similar to the rest of our media business, so we\u2019re taking a longer term view on the business itself. And we\u2019re very excited about the opportunity, but we\u2019re trying to find the right balance for our overall business and for that business in particular. We do have some fulfillment businesses that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, certainly in those businesses that they don\u2019t require a lot of capital, they give great returns. And our primary focus is on EBIT dollars as opposed to the absolute margin percentage. So that\u2019s certainly at any one quarter can have an impact on our mix.","William Bird \u2013 FBR","And just separately on programmatic, is there any difference in the way you account for it and recognize revenues versus your other media buying businesses?","John Wren","Well I think we follow GAAP and we\u2019ve always tried to be clear and consistent and straight forward about it, but the vast majority of our media businesses, we act as an agent. So there is a difference in the model versus the Accuen model. And the Accuen model we agree to some specific advertiser performance objective\u2019s up front, we agreed the price. And the price includes the whole package and the cost and execution risk is Accuen, so it\u2019s not an agency model, so there is a difference there.","William Bird \u2013 FBR","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen \u2013 Macquarie","Hi. Thanks, a couple things please if I could just try to characterize your comments on life outside the U.S., is it fair to say that you haven\u2019t necessarily seen any risk or pullback to spending, but you\u2019re certainly vary of issues, not just political issues or health issues in some regions, but just the growth in the Euro zone and in some emerging markets, is that a fair characterization? And secondly I wanted to ask you about your IT and software partnerships, you mentioned Salesforce and you\u2019ve got a couple others. Is there anything you can say in terms of what the scope of work is with these arrangements, help explain what they are, what type of revenue sharing agreements you might have, what the potential for growth from these might be? Thanks.","Phil Angelastro","With respect to your first question, Europe, I think by all accounts, has just introduced their own version of QE. And so we\u2019re not expecting much growth to come out of big countries in Europe as to distinguish it from the rest of the world. In other parts of the world, leaving aside wars and illness, I think what we\u2019ve seen is, they\u2019re still growing and god knows we still have plenty of room to gain market share. But they\u2019re not just; they\u2019re not growing at the same pace of growth that we were experiencing in the past. Your second question, and pardon me for not having been fast enough to write it down, could you repeat it?","Tim Nollen \u2013 Macquarie","Sure, it\u2019s about the IT and software partnerships that you\u2019ve had, you mentioned Salesforce.com and you\u2019ve done some others. Just, if you could explain a bit more what those are, what is the scope of work, are these like revenue share agreements, what\u2019s the growth profile of these? Just explain a bit more what those are please.","Phil Angelastro","Sure, the partnerships, and there\u2019s an over a 100 of them, are designed to do different things, and I\u2019m sure that our technology partners won access to our systems. And therefore access to our client spending. From our perspective they offer technology that we are not a technology company but we are a user of technology and we look to partner with to the person at the time or in the period that can help us achieve our goals.","Our goals are really to reach the right customer at the right time when they are in the right mood with the correct message. And all these various partnerships in one fashion or another are to refine our data and to back the information that we require in order to accomplish those things. And to your other question there aren\u2019t any specific set of revenue sharing or payment streams these are partnerships which benefit both parties in terms of the task and the scope we\u2019re asking each party to perform.","Phil Angelastro","And just add to that a little bit on the sales front Essentially the partnerships with CRM data sharing initiative that\u2019s going to help us and \u2013 create more personalized communications to connect the dots between these marketing sales and customers service information, we think that agreement\u2019s going to be a particular use for our CRM agencies, so it\u2019s really about the data sharing.","And on Facebook front, as John said it\u2019s a partnership that\u2019s going to provide our clients ultimately who choose to use \u2013 all the benefits of people based marketing. And being able to target and measure based on people in both online and offline measurement world, so it\u2019s really getting access to the technology and the platform but again it isn\u2019t the deal that has commitments on our side.","Tim Nollen \u2013 Macquarie","Okay thank you.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you good morning and thanks for the color on programmatic which of course I want to ask more questions on. It is a big topic so can you help us think about from an Omnicom perspective, how incremental programmatic is to your business from your clients. I guess what I\u2019m struggling speaking about is if a client spends x amount of dollars on media buying through Omnicom traditionally, either on TV or through direct digital platforms and then shift to buy it through your Accuen platform. Is that generating incremental revenue for you and of it is, is it primarily because the accounting is different, because you\u2019re acting or as principle as you said before programmatic. And if it is the incremental where\u2019s that money coming from, and obviously client I wouldn\u2019t imagine that clients are spending more money in aggregate because of programmatic but maybe that\u2019s incorrect?","John Wren","I would agree, I don\u2019t see more new money coming in to the overall spend I see a shift our objective through all of this is to improve the ROI of the money spent by our clients. And them achieving their objective of reaching customers and, technology allows you to do that when \u2013 we have traditional customers that are trading on trading desk that are embedded in our agencies. And there were just in the marketplace bidding against whoever else is out there.","We also have an opt-in model where we are in a sense taking the risk of achieving objectives that the client laid out in reaching those audiences. One is more of a known to the client, one is since you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re bidding against at any given time. We don\u2019t quite know what the environment\u2019s going to be, so the accounting is pretty straight forward the accounting is defined by a bunch of people who sit behind GAAP and depending on, I\u2019ve learned years ago simply to accept what they say, not to argue with they say. So I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve answered your question but it is an increasing area, where we can be more effective to the client\u2019s dollars.","Ben Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay I think that makes sense. In another words the clients want to pay Omnicom more as a percentage of its overall spending, because the buyer is more valuable from an ROI perspective I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re predicting?","John Wren","Right and we are agnostic player in the marketplace, and as we move forward in some of our predictions come true, there are going to be couple of players, there\u2019s always going to be Google, there\u2019s always going to be Facebook. In all likelihood there always be WPP and then us who have the scaling and the source and we are agnostic we\u2019re not attempting to sale inventory that we only mass. We are simply going after audiences but we know our clients\u2019 needs to reach.","Ben Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","That was actually where I wanted to go to, it\u2019s just in relationship with Facebook particularly on Atlas because it would seem overtime you\u2019re competing for economics Atlas, from an Accuen perspective both trying to get a fee on mobile spending for advertisers and may be there\u2019s an analogy with Google on double click that you could point as to how that works, well over time?","John Wren","Right now I consider both companies friends and not enemies there isn\u2019t that much conflict between what we are trying to do and what they are trying to do. We are cognizant every day that could change at some point in the future but right now they are big clients of ours and we are big clients of theirs and we ventured into economically sound deals with both.","Phil Angelastro","Certainly we see them as partners and keep in mind no single media vendors sees the whole landscape quite like we do. And as John had said we are neutral third party, so we see search social display video, across all devices and we try to link the customers across all of them which not everybody can do.","Ben Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks for the color.","John Wren","Sure. I think we have time for just one last quick question.","Operator","Okay our final question today will come from line of John Janedis from Jefferies.","John Janedis \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you. I\u2019ll make this fast. First just going back fulfillment business Phil have seen any change to the margin profile over the past year or so. Has the growth been similar to the rest of Omnicom and then secondly you talked briefly about Russia, there seems to be maybe some change on the table there that\u2019ll impact advertising. Are you seeing any kind of early signs and further slowing in, can you remind us about its revenue contribution I\u2019m assuming low singles?","Phil Angelastro","Yeah, in terms of size it\u2019s definitely low singles on the low end of the low singles for Russia, back to your margin point. I think the profile hasn\u2019t really changed we approach each of our agencies, each of our core operations and work with them to try and find margin that\u2019s right for them. And again we\u2019re focused on the margin dollars not just a percentage that you can\u2019t really feel and touch. And we think great businesses, great returns and we\u2019re happy to have them. They\u2019ve been performing well on the whole over a period of time that they kind of perform similar to Omnicom overall I think probably little slower rate than we\u2019ve seen in Accuen and the media business lately but we\u2019re happy with their performance.","John Janedis \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks. Just a quickly on Russia, anything in terms it\u2019s just the tender of the business I know you mentioned its slowing a little bit but any sense that slow is more so going forward or not yet?","Phil Angelastro","Not yet the business has actually been doing well not just for the external environment in Russia the business has been solid, we haven\u2019t seen any signs yet of that other than a slight slowdown and some excellent performance but it\u2019s still performing really well. No reason to think anything is imminent.","John Janedis \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you.","John Wren","Okay. Well thank you everyone for joining the call. And we\u2019ll talk to you again soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and using the AT&T Executive Teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to introduce to your host for today\u2019s conference, Vice President of Investor Relations, Shub Mukherjee. Please go ahead.","Shub Mukherjee","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. On the call with me today is John Wren, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Phil Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer.","We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release we have posted on our website, www.omnicomgroup.com, this morning\u2019s press release along with the presentation covering the information that we will review this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I\u2019ve been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation, and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and that these statements are our present expectation and that actual events or results may differ materially.","I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom\u2019s performance. You will find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.","We are going to begin this morning\u2019s call with an overview of our business from John Wren, then Phil Angelastro will provide our financial results for the quarter, and then we will open up the line for your questions.","John Wren","Thank you, Shub. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I am pleased to speak to you this morning about our first quarter results. We\u2019re off to a very good start. Revenue increased by 2.5% to almost $3.6 billion.","Organic revenue growth for the first quarter was 4.4%. Currency headwinds continued to be a drag on our topline and reduced revenue growth by 1.2%. Our EBITDA margins met our expectations and increased by 30 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016. While our revenue growth exceeded our internal targets for the quarter, we remained cautious as numerous geopolitical and macroeconomic events remain unresolved.","In the U.S. it is still isn\u2019t clear on how legislation in several major areas including the budget, tax reform, infrastructure spending and healthcare could impact the economy, and the U.S.\u2019s relationship with several key international trading partners is also being tested by the new administration.","In Europe, the combination of Brexit and the upcoming general elections in France and Germany may lead to policy shifts in those countries. In Asia and the Middle East, the situation in North Korea is increasingly unsettling and the crisis in Syria continues to destabilize both the Middle East and Europe. In the face of these macro events, Omnicom\u2019s agencies remain focussed on the things they can control, developing their talents, delivering results for their clients and driving improvement in their financial results.","Our performance in the quarter once again demonstrates the consistency and diversity of our operations, the strong competitive position that our agencies have across the spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines in key geographic markets and our digital data and analytical expertise and the success of our strategy in this area.","Before I cover our performance by region, I\u2019d like to address our ongoing evaluation of our portfolio of companies which we addressed on our year end call in February. We continue to evaluate our portfolio of businesses to ensure they strategically align with our goals. As a result of this process, during the last several months, we disposed over a number of field marketing events and other non-core operations which did not fit our long term goals.","At the beginning of April, we also disposed the majority stake in the legacy print media business which operates in the Unites States and Canada. As a result of these dispositions and considering the acquisitions we have completed to date, we expect disposition revenue to exceed acquisition revenue for the full year 2017.","More specifically, we expect negative net disposition revenue to be between 3.5% to 4.5% for the year. The elimination of these businesses from our portfolio should result in an EBITDA margin increase of an additional 20 basis points for the remainder of 2017.","At this point, although we continue to evaluate our portfolio of businesses we expect that our disposition activity for 2017 is substantially complete and we do not expect any additional significant dispositions this year. We will continue to focus on our strategy of making internal investments and finding accretive acquisitions that further strengthen our core capabilities.","Turning now to our organic revenue growth by region. North America was up just over 1%. We benefitted from positive performances at our traditional advertising and media agencies as well as our digital CRM businesses. However, this was offset by declines at our events, field marketing and branding businesses.","The U.K. grew at a very healthy 8% with solid performances across all of our disciplines. In Europe we experienced strong growth of 8.2% with almost all of the countries across the continent performing well. Looking at Asia Pacific, first quarter organic growth was 9% similar to Europe the results in Asia were strong in most countries with Australia, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea and New Zealand all contributing significantly to the growth in the region.","Latin America was up 5.4%, our operations in Mexico continue to outperform and Brazil returned to positive growth although it was in the low single digits. As compared to the prior year, our EBITDA for the quarter increased $19.9 million or 4.7% to $440.3 million.","EBITDA margins increased to 12.3% versus 12% in the first quarter of 2016. Net income available for common shares for the first quarter increased $24.4 million or 11.2% to $241.3 million. The results were positively affected by the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement related to accounting for tax benefits on stock based compensation. Phil can better explain this to you later.","The combined result was an increase in EPS of 13.3% to $1.02 a share for the quarter versus $0.90 per share for the same quarter a year ago. For the first three months of 2017 we generated $355 million in free cash flow and returned approximately $360 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our cash flow balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong. Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter results.","It\u2019s only been two months since our last conference call and our focus has been to continue to execute against the goals we laid out in February, expanding our talent facing capabilities, simplifying our service offerings through our new practise area and client matrix structure, making investments in our agencies and through acquisitions and driving efficiencies throughout our organization.","The goal of our individual practise areas together with our global client group is to deliver to clients the industry\u2019s best talent and continuous innovation by better targeting our internal investments and fostering collaborations. Our efforts in this area are driven through both formal and informal practises that preserve the individuality and culture of our agency brands while delivering customized connected solutions.","You can expect further developments on these initiatives throughout 2017. On the acquisition front in the first quarter, TBWA acquired a majority stake in Lucky Generals; one of the leading independent creative agencies in the U.K. Lucky Generals has been shortlisted for campaigns, agency of the year for the last two years and has a superb management team. We are thrilled to have them join the group and I\u2019m certain that it will make a significant contribution to TBWA.","Our operational efficiency programs in areas such as real estate, information technology, back office accounting services and procurement continue to take effect. Through these programs we are enhancing our platform systems and controls and driving cost improvements across the group.","Overall, we are very satisfied with the progress on our strategic initiatives and our financial performance in the first quarter. While there are three quarters to go, right now we feel good about our ability to deliver on our 2017 full year organic growth target of 3% to 3.5% and a 50 basis point EBITDA margin improvement.","Turning now to our people, our belief and investment in town [ph] data and analytics creativity and collaboration are paying off in terms of industry recognition. Let me just highlight a few. For the 11th straight year, OMD topped the Gunn [ph] report for media. For the first time ever, a single holding company won two Adweek Media Agency of the year titles. As PHD won the Global category and Hearts & Science won breakthrough agency.","BBDO topped the WARC 100 ranking as the most strategic networks in the world and Adam & Eve\/DDB was the highest ranking creative agency. I want to congratulate everyone that have helped win these awards and drive our business everyday. Your talent is a great reflection on Omnicom and your hardwork is appreciated.","Omnicom\u2019s ability to win awards relies on talent and for us that means a diverse workforce. We recognize that a diverse group of people will create a stronger culture, perform at a higher level and will be better at developing meaningful insights in creative content. That\u2019s why we continue to push hard on our diversity initiatives.","Last quarter, Omni women celebrated International Women\u2019s Day by launching four new chapters, in Canada, France, Germany and the UAE bringing the total number of regional chapters to more than ten. In the three short years since Omni women was launched, I am delighted by how influential and successful the organization has been in promoting diversity and we are seeing the benefits across all aspects of our business.","Finally, as many of you may recall in 2016 Omnicom took meaningful steps on our board refreshment process with the on boarding of exceptional candidates who bring a wealth of experience and fresh perspectives. I\u2019m happy to report that our commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive workforce starts to comp with Omnicom\u2019s independent board of directors now including five women and three men already members. Sadly, long serving board member Mike A. Henning will be stepping down from the board in May. We would like to recognize Mike and extend our thanks to him for his outstanding leadership, dedication and loyalty to Omnicom over the years. The board expects to continue to add new additional members over the next several years.","In closing, we are pleased that our performance continues to reflect the excellence of our people and agencies. We are off to a strong start to the year and well positioned to deliver on our internal targets.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the first quarter results.","Philip Angelastro","Thank you, John and good morning. As John said Q1 was a good quarter. Our agencies performed well in meeting the objectives of their clients and the financial and strategic goals we set for them. Total revenue for the quarter was just under $3.6 billion, an increase of 2.5% versus Q1 of 2016.","Our organic revenue growth for the quarter was 4.4%. Regarding FX, the negative impact of currency rates was lower in Q1 than we have experienced recently. On a reported basis, while we continue to be negatively impacted by the weakening of the British Pound, the FX impact our other major currency was mixed.","For the first quarter, the FX impact reduced revenue by 1.2% or about $41 million. As we have discussed previously, we continue to evaluate our portfolio of businesses to ensure they align with our strategies, and over the past several months, we have disposed off several entities that do not fit our strategic long term goals. This is reflected in the negative impact on revenue from our disposition activity through March 31st, which exceeded our acquisition revenue in the quarter reducing revenue by $24 million or 7 basis points.","I\u2019ll go into further detail regarding our revenue growth and our acquisition and disposition activity later in the presentation. Looking at the rest of the income statement, operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased 4.5% to $410 million. With operating margin improving to 11.4%, a 20 basis point margin improvement versus Q1 of last year.","Q1 EBITDA increased 4.7% to $440 million, and the resulting EBITDA margin of 12.3% represents a 30 basis point increase over Q1 of last year. And our operational efficiency programs focussed on the areas of real estate, back office services and procurement continue to be primary drivers of our margin improvement.","Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest for the quarter was $39.6 million down $0.5 million versus Q1 of last year and down $600,000 versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross interest expense was $53.5 million an increase of $3.2 million versus Q1 of last year and an increase of $1.3 million versus Q4 of 2016.","The increases were due to the reduced benefit from our fixed to floating interest rates swaps and higher interest rates have decreased the benefit on the floating like of our swaps as well as additional interest expense on our future earn out obligations.","Interest income this quarter was higher when compared to Q1 a year ago, resulting from higher cash balances held by anti national treasury centers when compared to last year, as well as an increase in interest rates on those deposits versus the rates we earned during Q1 of 2016.","Additionally, interest income from our international treasury centers was higher in the first quarter of 2017 when compared to Q4 of 2016. Although as expected, we saw our cash balances decrease in Q1 compared to year end, an increase in interest rates helped offset any reductions.","As you may be aware on January 1st, we were required to adopt ASU 2016-09 which changed the way income tax expenses recognized on share based compensation under U.S. GAAP.","The new standard requires that the difference between the book tax expense and the cash tax deduction recorded on our tax return from share based compensation we recorded to income tax expense. This difference is generated as a result of our stock price on the date of the award, compared to the stock price on the date that restricted stock vest, on the date that stock options were exercised.","For the first quarter, we recorded an additional tax benefit on share based compensation of 12.4 million which reduced our effected tax rate for Q1 2017 by 3.3%. The standard requires prospect of recognition and does not allow restatement of prior periods. Previously, under GAAP this difference for us was recorded directly to equity and not to the P&L.","As a result, our effective tax rate for Q1 was 29.2%. Excluding the benefit from the adoption of the new accounting standard, our effective tax rate would have been 32.5%, which is slightly lower than last year\u2019s rate of 32.8% and in line with our expectations regarding our full year 2017 tax rate.","Earnings from our affiliates were marginally positive during the first quarter, and the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders and our less than fully owned subsidiaries increased $2.7 million, $20.6 million from $17.9 million mainly the result of improved performance at our less than fully owned subsidiaries versus the first quarter of last year.","Including the benefit to income tax expense from adopting the new accounting standard, our reported net income for the quarter was $241.8 million an increase of 10.7% compared to last year. Excluding the benefit to income tax expense, our net income would have been $229.4 million, an increase of 5% versus Q1 of last year.","Now turning to slide two, the reported net income available for common shareholders for the quarter was $241.3 million, and our diluted shares for the quarter were $236.5 million down 1.9% versus last year resulting from net share repurchases. As a result, our reported diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.02, up $0.12 or 13.3% versus diluted EPS of $0.90 from Q1 of last year.","The impact of the new accounting standard increased our diluted EPS by $0.05. Excluding the impact of the additional tax benefit under the new accounting standard, diluted EPS would have been $0.97, which when compared to Q1 of last year is an increase of $0.07 a share or 7.8%.","An additional point regarding our new accounting standard that we were required to adopt is the final income tax benefit is based on Omnicom\u2019s share price at the future vesting date for restricted stock and at the exercise date for stock options is not possible to estimate with any certainty the impact of the new accounting pronouncement for our income tax rate or our net income or our diluted EPS for the full year.","However, in 2017 the bulk of our share based awards for restricted stock vested in the first quarter therefore including the impact of any stock option exercises our stock price remains in the range it was during the first quarter. We expect any additional tax benefits for the remainder of the year to be approximately half of the benefit that was included in our Q1 results.","Turning to slide three, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. During the quarter, the negative impact from FX was lower than it has in quite some time. As said previously, the British pound continued weakness we've seen since the Brexit vote last June.","On its own the FX impact of the pounds decline reduced our revenue by nearly $50 million in the first quarter. While with our other major currencies we've seen some volatility in rates since the November elections. For the quarter they netted to a slightly positive impact on our revenue in total.","For the quarter on a reported basis the dollar weakened against the Brazilian Real, Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the Russian ruble, and in addition to the pound the dollar strengthened against the Chinese yuan and the euro.","As a result, the net impact of FX changes decreased our quarterly revenue by $41 million, a 1.2%. If currencies stay where they currently are based on our most recent projections FX may negatively impact our revenues by approximately 2.2% for the second quarter of 2017 and 1.2% for the full year.","However, considering all the variables impacting the foreign currency markets quite difficult to estimate what will happen to FX rates for the rest of the year. Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions resulted in a decrease to revenue of $24.3 million in the quarter or 0.7%.","On the acquisition side TBWA closed on the acquisition of London-based Lucky Generals beginning of February. And we cycled through our largest recent acquisition Grupo ABC in January. For the Q1 acquisition revenue amount only includes one month's revenue from that acquisition.","On the disposition side, in the past several months we completed several dispositions including agencies in our field marketing and events discipline, as well as our most recent disposition in early April of Novus, our specialty print media business which operates in the U.S. and Canada.","Consistent with our prior discussions and considering both the dispositions and acquisitions completed to-date, disposition revenue will exceed acquisition revenue for the full year 2017.","Our current expectations are that net disposition revenue will be between 3.5%, 4.5% for the full year. Given several of the businesses that we disposed off, we\u2019re not our peak performers.","We expect that this will result in a benefit to our overall margin profile of 20 basis points, together with our previously discussed expectations to achieve margin improvement of 30 basis points. This would bring our total expected EBITDA margin improvement for the year to 50 basis points.","We plan to continue to evaluate our portfolio of business. However, we expect that our disposition activity for this year is substantially complete. We do not expect any significant additional dispositions in 2017.","Organic growth was positive $153 million or 4.4% this quarter. Some highlights of our growth this quarter include geographically all six of our regions had positive organic growth this quarter with the U.K., Continental Europe and Asia Pacific all delivering strong organic revenue results.","Full-service advertising agencies perform well again and our media businesses including Hearts & Science continue to perform very well. And our healthcare businesses had another strong quarter particularly strong growth from the healthcare group\u2019s international agencies.","On slide four highlighting our regional mix of business. You can see during the first quarter split was 60% for North America, 9% for the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe, 10.5% for Asia-Pacific, 3% for Latin America and only 2% for Africa and the Middle East.","By region organic revenue growth in North America was up 1.1%. We saw positive performances from our traditional advertising media agencies as well as our digital direct marketing businesses.","This was offset by declines in some of our other CRM businesses in the region including events and field marketing, as well as branding, shopper marketing and non-profit consultant.","In Europe, the U.K. once again had a great quarter with organic growth of about 8%, strong performances across most disciplines. The rest of Europe was up just over 8% organically in the quarter.","Within the euro zone we saw solid performances from Germany, as well as Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. France was marginally positive again this quarter but Netherlands continue to lag.","Both in Europe outside the euro zone strong across most of the markets including the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia and Switzerland, in the region the one market of note [ph] that is negative was Turkey.","The Asia-Pacific region was up just over 9%, and we continue to see organic growth across most of our major markets and disciplines in the region including in Australia as well as India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand.","The Greater China agencies had a solid quarter of organic growth as well. Latin America returned to positive organic growth during the first quarter. Brazil was slightly positive organically. However the macro economic and political conditions in the market continue to make it difficult for our agencies to grow their businesses on a consistent basis.","Elsewhere in the region outside of Brazil our agencies in Mexico continued their strong performance. And finally Africa and the Middle East which is our smallest region was up double digits organically driven primarily by our project-based businesses in the region.","Slide five shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter the split was 54% for traditional advertising services and 46% for marketing services. As of their organic growth performance our advertising discipline was up 6.4%, another solid performance.","Our growth in this discipline continues to be led by the performance over media businesses with good performance across all of our regions and most of our offerings, as well as good performances by many of our full-service advertising agencies.","DRM was up 2.1% for the quarter. We continue to see mixed results across our businesses and geographies. This quarter we saw strength in some of our international businesses which was particularly offset by weakness in the U.S.","Within CRM our direct marketing and digital direct agencies performed well in the quarter, while our branding businesses continue to struggle. PR was up 1.8% this quarter, and specialty communications primarily Omnicom Health Group was up 3.3% organically.","Turning to slide six, we present our mix of revenue to our client\u2019s industry sector. In comparing the Q1 revenue for 2017 -- 2016 you can see there were no major shifts in the percentages each industry contributed towards our total.","Turning to our cash flow performance, on slide seven you can see that in the first quarter we generated $355 million of free cash flow excluding changes in working capital.","As for our primary uses of cash on slide eight, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $131 million which reflects the effects of the 10% increase in the quarterly dividend that was approved last spring, which was partially offset by the reduction in shares outstanding due to repurchase activity.","Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders totaled $10 million and capital expenditures were $32 million for the quarter. While we've seen a decrease in CapEx, we have also seen a planned uptick in activity in our equipment leasing programs.","Acquisitions including earn out payments and net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments totaled $18 million. In stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $232 million. All in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $67 million during the first three months of the year.","Turning to slide nine, regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at March 31, 2017 of $4.94 billion, is up about $290 million from this time last year.","This increase resulted from the incremental $400 million of borrowings related to the debt issuance back in April of 2016 along with a decrease in the non-cash fair value of our debt of about $70 million over the past year which is directly related to an offset by change in the fair value of the respective interest rate swaps on our debt.","The increase in net debt relative to year-end was a result of the typical uses of working capital that historically occur in the first quarter which were approximately $550 million.","The use of cash in excess of our free cash flow approximately $67 million. These increases in net debt were partially offset by the effective exchange rates on cash during Q1 and increased our cash balance by about $70 million.","As far our ratios they remain strong. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.1 times and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times. And due to the year-over-year increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio was still quite strong decreased to 10.9 times.","Turning to slide 10, we continue to manage and build a company through a combination of development initiatives and judicially priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months our return on invested capital ratio improved to 21.8% while our return on equity increase to 52%.","And finally on slide 11, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10 plus years. Aligned on the top of the chart there\u2019s our cumulative net income in the beginning of 2007 to March 31 of 2017 which totaled $10.1 billion, while the bar shows the cumulative return of cash to shareholders including both net share repurchases and dividend which during the same period totaled $10.8 billion, all resulting in cumulative payout ratio of 107% since the beginning of 2007.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides and presentation materials for your review. But at this point we're going to ask operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. Just a couple questions. First, on your commentary on the dispositions. Thank you for that color and the impact on profitability, your margins for the year. I was wondering if you could also tell us what impact if any that these dispositions might have on organic revenue growth? And any more color because they\u2019re largely in the U.S. I know you mentioned one of the bigger ones was in North America, but anything else that might skewed more toward the U.S. versus International?","John Wren","Sure. I think the largest of the acquisitions which we closed in early April, it was the print media business is focus in the U.S. primarily and they have an operation in Canada. The rest of our dispositions occurred both in the U.S. and outside the U.S., so it isn't just U.S. exclusively. Some of the field marketing operations are in the U.S. and some are outside of the U.S. So the mix is a primarily North American of the total dispositions that we completed to-date.","And then on the organic growth front, certainly we think going forward is going to be a benefit from the dispositions to our overall organic growth profile. But in terms of the size of the numbers, it takes an awful lot to kind of move the needle. So, we don't want to anticipate a significant increase in the profile in the immediate term, but we think as closing of these businesses was the right thing from a long term strategic perspective, they didn\u2019t really fit our strategies regarding sustainable long-term revenue growth and profit growth.","Alexia Quadrani","And then if you could give us maybe any more color in terms of why you\u2019ve seen such disparity in organic growth in general in the quarter and the last couple of quarters you have such impressive organic revenue growth internationally, but the U.S. continues just sort of trend below sort of company average. I guess any color and what\u2019s pressuring that if it may not if these businesses really were not necessarily upsize and if they are, that\u2019s a kind of weighing on it, but it sound like they\u2019re healthy mix in U.S. and non-U.S.","And then, John maybe if you just give us some color on if you\u2019re seeing above average pressure from clients, either on consumer packaged goods area where one of your peers mentioned some pressuring or maybe even the retail segment which I know is not that big for you guys given that what\u2019s going on it in that vertical? Thank you.","John Wren","Sure. Well, some of the pressure in the U.S. has come from things that we discussed in the fourth quarter, our year end call. Branding for instance, which generally are projects which you don't have a large backlog on and normally probably you have two months from start to go. That's been a ongoing issue for us and it comes down, I think in large part to leadership and one of my network CEOs is taking me very seriously and hasn't yet found the proper replacements for certain people who are no longer with us.","I'm very confident about the business because they are very smart people and when you do have the right people that growth will come back pretty quickly. Also field marketing, what\u2019s left of it in the United States was disappointing only because of one or two retailers which have seriously cut back. Those tend to be low margin businesses, but the volume of the revenue is associated with them can be impactful in any quarter.","Again nothing terribly troublesome and certainly not to the core businesses which we live on, but it is something that we\u2019re working on and should see improvement as we get through the rest of the year. In terms of package goods, we've been very fortunate. First of all, I guess out of all the three, as we take just the big three players, our profile in large packages companies, we were last to the party, though our revenue from those areas are not nearly anywhere near the size of our competitors and the rest of the industry.","And those clients are adjusting their services that they have traditionally purchased from those competitors. If you have to look at their portfolios and how they serve those clients you\u2019d see quite a bit thing like market research and some other areas where they gain a lot of revenue, those whole areas are changing.","The things that we've been able to sell the large packaged goods clients, we\u2019re partnering with them have been in more contemporary type of services and we're coming from a smaller base, so the impact is nearly what they projected in whatever public comments they\u2019ve made. Is that answers your question, Alexia?","Alexia Quadrani","Perfect. And then anything from retail or do you think retailers is sort of same old or you\u2019re seeing, but reading obviously about how much pressure that retail industry. Have you seen any pressure there?","John Wren","No. We make the assumption that there\u2019s going to continued pressure especially big box type of retailer. I take the view that pressure is not going away any time soon and the storage that you see out there principally showrooms where people go and see the products that they want to buy, touch them, feel them, but then they go back home and purchase them online. ","And some of the stats that came out of the credit card companies in year end show a real increase for the very first time. It\u2019s always been increasing. But I think it exceeded almost 30% of year-end sales which is to me a tipping point of how things are moving, going to move going forward.","Alexia Quadrani","Okay.","John Wren","That is why intrude strategically with some of the dispositions that we did were not only domestically but internationally are in the field marketing businesses because whereas they\u2019ve contributed to growth at a low margin in the past what we see going forward is still going to low margin, but the growth that they\u2019re going to able to contribute is going to be really stifled. So it was good to sell them to people who want them and have different objectives than we do.","Alexia Quadrani","Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Roch from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julien Roch","Yes. Good morning and thank you very much for taking the question. The first the question is on Accuen, if we could get the contribution to organic in the quarter. The second question is it [Indiscernible] an idea of the organic of the business you sold in Q1. Was it down 5.10 [ph] or what would have been organic in Q1 if 100% of disposals have been down, any color would be great?","And then the last question is as you said that the mix of the assets you sold that was probably North America. Can we get an idea is it 60%, 70%, 80% any color would be great as well? Thank you very much.","Philip Angelastro","Most of the sale with the exception of Novus happened early in the first quarter, so they themselves didn\u2019t have much of an impact in organic growth.","Julien Roch","Yes. But if you assume that been done on the 1st of Jan what would have been impact of some or maybe the kind of an idea of the organic of the assets you sold, because I assume they were declining?","Philip Angelastro","I think, overall the portfolio of businesses that we\u2019ve disposed off probably would have dragged or broke down a bit, but not to a great degree if you look at it on an annualized basis. I think the driver -- the key driver of why we\u2019ve taken this direction is the future growth profile of these businesses. So while in any one quarter in the past 12 months or so, they might have marginally impacted our growth profile to a small degree, probably negatively.","We think going forward, the chances of them growing in any consistent meaningful way versus the chances of them continuing to kind of define strategically. We think the chances of decline prospectively, much more likely which was the key driver behind the disposition strategy. As far as couple of other items you have there, Accuen is basically flat for the quarter, so no real growth in Accuen this quarter. It was actually down slightly in North America. And from our perspective it's not unexpected.","John Wren","And you should be careful of how you read that. The underlying business actually grew except for clients instead of buying it on a bundled basis that moved to buying it as an agent, they using us as an agent to procure those services. So the business itself is very healthy, but the method in which our services approaches changed and that's why we get the mathematical solution that you got.","Julien Roch","So that means that it\u2019s because of Accuen is flat for the quarter than it actually had a negative impact on overall cost, right. Or when you say\u2026","Philip Angelastro","A neutral impact on the calculation of organic growth, but it's kind of one of those very odd doesn't happened or hasn\u2019t happened very much in the past. The way that we offer those services are on a bundled and in undisclosed basis and on a disclosed basis lot of the clients have shifted to wanting those services on a fully disclosed basis which puts us in the position of treating it as if we were their agent and not selling them a product. So the underlying business is healthy. It just doesn't reflect in the math of how you would go about calculating organic growth.","John Wren","Yes. The more and more brand-based advertisers look for ways to effectively target the consumer that they're trying to reach through programmatic. They\u2019re more likely to choose the more traditional approach and we\u2019re fine with that. Its still early days in the programmatic space, as John had said business continues to grow and we\u2019re happy to offer to our clients in whichever way they find most useful. But Accuen being flat for the quarter, we don't really look at it is as if somehow that drag down our growth profile, mean it essentially flat for the quarter.","We don't expect that it's going to go back to growth profile we had on prior years. We think this shift may continue and as long as the underlying business continues to grow that's fine with us.","Julien Roch","Okay. And the last one was the mix of the assets you sold, you said primarily North America, but can we have an idea, is it 60%, 70%, 80%?","Philip Angelastro","I think it\u2019s probably in the 70% to 75% ballpark. So if you said three quarters of it as North America, that\u2019s probably about right. I don't have a schedule in front of me that does the math. But I think that\u2019s about right.","Julien Roch","Okay. Thank you very much.","Philip Angelastro","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. John, just you talk a lot of the macro environment beginning of the call and I\u2019m just \u2013 but at the same time you reiterated your full year outlook. I\u2019m just wondering if you are just sort of giving us some color or if you're advertisers are getting a little more nervous given what you see on TV and in the news every day? I just wanted to see if we could revisit that for a minute?","John Wren","Most of really intelligent people I speak to don\u2019t watch TV.","Ben Swinburne","Okay.","John Wren","But you had this morning. You had the U.K. announcing an election in June. In Turkey you had a very narrow win this past Sunday, which linked into a change the way that their government efforts. Though I think everybody I speak to is cautious. They\u2019re not \u2013 there are still animal spirits out there and everybody is hoping that just a number of these initiatives around the world especially those in the United States get pushed through what seems to have slept is the timing of when you might see those benefits, but they haven't given up hope. But as a result we have to plan a business. You have to take all that into consideration and plan for what you know and not for what you hope for.","And so there hasn\u2019t -- when you see, in fact that we haven't changed our guidance for the rest of the year when it comes to the top line and it's really reflective of that caution and what clients are committing to us versus if some of these things happen or they pass quietly we\u2019re prepared to grow with the marketplace.","Ben Swinburne","And then, Phil, just to come back to the dispositions one more time, just doing some back in the envelope math, I think what you gave us, it\u2019s a revenue impact offset by margin, better margin expansion suggested that these decisions did have some profits associate with them, I just wanted to confirm that there is an earnings impacts from the additional I guess, 30 [ph] basis points net dispositions this year?","Philip Angelastro","Yes. I think the businesses themselves certainly have lower margins in the overall on the account profile. And if you wanted to assume somewhere in mid-single digits that's probably roughly a good rough assumption.","John Wren","But if I heard the question correctly, the 30 basis points is really predicated off of last year's performance and we don\u2019t see this dispositions and any income or that they contributed will make that up in making our numbers.","Ben Swinburne","Yes, I understand got it. And maybe just one last one for either of you, I\u2019m just curious that it\u2019s been made evident that Amazon has become a much bigger advertising business particularly on search than we thought in prior years. Just curious when you look at how you advise your clients particularly with all the controversy that\u2019s been going on with Google and YouTube, you know is Amazon becoming an increasingly attractive option for advertisers on the search side or are they still sort of more just around the margin, I know Google is obviously pretty dominant in that space, so just curious if you have any thoughts there?","John Wren","I think Google\u2019s dominance continues especially in search. It\u2019s an important alternative and I would never underestimate over the longer run, but at what Amazon is capable of doing. But if you are looking at 2017 or the more immediate future I\u2019d only list it as an important alternative to Google and that\u2019s somebody who I anticipate is going to take most you know their market share in the short run.","Ben Swinburne","Yep. Thank you both.","John Wren","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen","Hi, thanks. Sorry to come back on the dispositions one, hopefully last time. Just to be clear, I think so you said net dispositions, meaning the acquisition line for you guys would be down 3.5% to 4.5% just want to make sure that its net dispositions offset by some acquisitions with a net minus 3.5% to minus 4.5%.","Philip Angelastro","Yes, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s net of acquisitions we completed to date.","Tim Nollen","Okay, so that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s reported revenue a bit further down than we had previously had given the scope of the dispositions. Okay, secondly if you come back on North America again please, could you remind us what is the timing of these major account wins that you have had Volkswagen, AT&T, McDonald's some of those, have they begun to contribute in Q1 and if there is any sense you can give us of the scope that they will contribute. I\u2019m just wondering kind of what is the underlying, underlying North America growth rate that maybe somewhat offset by those revenues coming in as they do.","And lastly, back on the CPG spending question, and tying it to the branding comments that you\u2019ve had about branding having been a weak business particularly in the U.S. lately, I know there\u2019s been a big emphasis on promotions within the CPG and retail sectors for the last few years just wondering if you sense that that maybe coming off the boil now and maybe a shift back into branding from the manufacturers and the retailers which would obviously help your business?","John Wren","Just repeat that last question Tim.","Tim Nollen","So on the branding business, which you said is hurting in the U.S. I know a lot of CPG manufacturers and retailers have been absorbing a lot of promotions as opposed to branding. So you know the A versus the P you know the promotions don\u2019t necessarily help to the advertising the branding business would help, the question is are we beginning maybe to see a shift back in the some more branding away from promotions.","Philip Angelastro","Okay, I\u2019ll take the first one. So, the answer is yes, all those wins have been contributing at this point. P&G and AT&T go back to 16 P&G probably started with Hearts & Science in the second quarter and most of the wins you referenced the large and medium wins other than MacDonald\u2019s. VW [ph] just started up January 1st and it\u2019s a global business win for us for PHD not just North America. AT&T probably started in the fourth quarter of 2016 and MacDonald\u2019s also recently started in early 2017 for us as well, so that gives you the sense of the timing.","John Wren","And mind you MacDonald\u2019s we had a lot of that underlying work already, we were able to consolidate North America, the way that we won the business. I thought it was incremental and just start off....","Tim Nollen","And have you given us any sense of the relative revenue contribution from these?","John Wren","You know we\u2019ve got a big portfolio of businesses. We had a lot of wins and a lot of losses unfortunately. We\u2019re trying to dwell on the losses but certainly these wins were an exclusive that there are some ups and downs in the broader portfolio and that\u2019s part of the strategy to have a broad diverse portfolio that can provide some consistency and less volatility, so certainly there is some other offsetting, some factors offsetting the contributions of the new wins, but we are happy with the underlying performance of the businesses that generated the wins and we continue to work with all the businesses in our portfolio. You want to take the branding....","Philip Angelastro","By all means. In terms of promotions versus brand, advertising of the bigger, the of the P&G's of the world, that really hasn't been the primary shift atleast I don\u2019t believe, I think what you are seeing is almost an evaluation as to the number of vendors that those big advertisers use, a reduction or a consolidation of the number of vendors that they use and then zero based budgeting type of activity which has \u2013 we produced this ad, do we really need to test it in six markets for 12-weeks in an old traditional fashion or is there other ways to find out whether we are reaching the audiences or not. That\u2019s technology, the changing consumer, all that all has an impact on all those individual decisions and I think that\u2019s what you see going on as those companies like our own and others look to make certain that if you can reduce an expense than get at it, and so that\u2019s what I really think is going on and I think it\u2019s a permanent trend for some of those big companies who try to make their marketing dollars work more efficiently.","Tim Nollen","Okay, thank you.","John Wren","Do you think Operator given that the time of the market opened I think we have time for one more call?","Operator","Okay, that question comes from the line of John Janedis from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis","Hi, thank you. I\u2019ll wrap it up with two quick questions. First, John you talk about the volatility in the Latin American region over the past few quarters, but are you at a point now where you think you can see sustained growth in the region or is the quarter more of a one-off and then I guess bigger picture you have historically talked about the importance of investing in talent and your people and understanding the first quarter is always this moment seasonally if the organic revenue trend continues can we potentially see more operating leverage or would you reinvest that into the business?","John Wren","In terms of Latin, we were pleasantly surprised although it\u2019s early days to see Brazil stabilize and I think the new government down there or most of that\u2019s behind them, so we should continue to see incremental improvement. We also expanded at the end of the year in Colombia and we\u2019re just first bedding those companies down into our portfolio. So I\u2019m bullish in the long run on Latin America, there\u2019s a lot of population. They have gone through a lot of difficulty but they seem to have been, had great strides in fixing many of the problems or atleast addressing many of the problems.","In terms of your second question...","Philip Angelastro","Yes, in terms of you know if the growth continues I think we are \u2013 John\u2019s comments earlier on in terms of our expectations for the rest of the year and given the uncertainty that\u2019s out there we are certainly not committing beyond I think what we said, but you know in terms of the contribution or the potential contribution we are always looking to try to find the right balance between where do we invest, how much do we invest and you know wanting to grow, so I think you\u2019ll continue to see us look to leverage the business but you\u2019ll also continue to see us look to reinvest in the business so that we can build more sustainable future growth as opposed to keeping a short term focus.","John Janedis","All right, thank you.","John Wren","Thank you. Thanks everybody for joining us on the call. Appreciate it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

I\u2019m pleased to speak to you this morning about our second quarter 2018 results. We had a good second quarter. Organic growth was 2%. Second quarter EBITA margin was 15.8%, flat versus the same period in 2017; and EPS for the quarter was up 14.2% to $1.60 per share.","Looking at our second quarter organic growth across disciplines, we saw positive results in almost every area of our portfolio including Advertising and Media, CRM, Consumer Experience, Healthcare and PR. The one exception to this performance was CRM Execution & Support, which was down 4.4% in the quarter. The agencies in this discipline provide services in various specialized areas including field marketing, sales support and merchandising, point of sale, as well as other specialized marketing and custom communications. Certain businesses in our CRM Execution & Support disciplines have been part of our ongoing evaluation of our portfolio companies to ensure that they align with our long-term strategies.","As part of this evaluation, we recently entered into a definitive agreement to sell Sellbytel Group to Webhelp Group, a global business process outsourcer. Sellbytel is a provider of outsourced sales, service and support with centers located primarily in Germany, Portugal, Spain, and Malaysia. Whilst Sellbytel has been a good profitable business, we determined it is not a core operation for Omnicom and will be better aligned with Webhelp Group. The Sellbytel transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018. We are continuing to evaluate our portfolio of companies to optimize our service and service capabilities in line with our strategic plans.","As part of this process, we are making internal investments in our agencies and in new capabilities and pursuing several acquisition opportunities, particularly in the areas of data analytics, digital transformation, and precision marketing. We also expect several of the dispositions to be completed in the third quarter in areas that are not consistent with our long-term strategies. Looking now at our organic growth by region, North American revenue was down 0.9% with the U.S. down about half a 0.5%. CRM, Consumer Experience, Healthcare, and PR all performed well with combined growth in North America of almost 12% in the quarter. This positive result was weighed down by negative performance in CRM, Execution and Support as well as by North American Advertising and Media, where we face declines from several Advertising and Media client losses that occurred in the prior periods and reductions in scope. In addition, certain clients continue to change the way they are purchasing media in the programmatic business, although this trend is slowing. We expect these headwinds to partially subside in the second half of 2018.","The UK was down just over 2% in second quarter. Advertising and Media, and PR performed very well, while Healthcare was flat. Offsetting this growth were declines in CRM, particularly in Execution and Support services due to weak performance in our field marketing and research business. Overall growth in the euro and non-euro region was very strong at just over 11%, led by France, Italy and Spain as well as Russia and Czech Republic. Germany and Portugal had negative Europe.","Asia Pacific second quarter organic growth was 8.5% as Australia, China, Korea and New Zealand had double digit growth and India also performed well. Latin America increased 2.5% for the quarter, Mexico led the way with mid single digit growth while digital continued to improve sequentially and moved to positive growth for the quarter. Our smallest region, the Middle East and Africa declined 8% for the quarter. Africa performed quite well while the Middle East declined relative to challenging comps last year.","Looking at our cash flow in the first half of 2018, we generated over $815 million in free cash flow and returned $740 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our use of cash flow remains unchanged, paying our dividend, pursuing accretive acquisitions and repurchasing shares with the balance of our free cash flow. Lastly, our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong.","Let me turn to how we are continually improving our organization and operations to address the changes that are affecting our industry. The key topic that is keeping many of the world\u2019s top marketers up at night is how to manage disruption in their business whether it\u2019s threats from new competitors or keeping pace with changing consumer behaviors. Our agencies are working with them to reinvent their marketing and communication strategies with an ever increasing focus on placing our clients\u2019 customer at the center. For this reason, Omnicom for many years has been investing in data, analytics and precision marketing. While audience data and effective targeting is a key element for marketing and communications, equally important in our view is delivering inspiring, motivating and compelling, creative content.","In fact, at the recent Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity, I was pleased to hear from our clients that data and technology should be in service to creativity and content. At Omnicom, it\u2019s always been a priority to have effective content that is a blend of creativity and technology. It is this unique culture of creative solutions and ideas that our agency is excelling. And while data and technology thrive at scale, creativity thrives in triads. For that reason, we believe individual agencies driven by strong cultures will continue to exist as incubators of creativity supported by the latest data and technology tools. That is why Omnicom is staying true to our roots of recruiting and developing the best creative minds in our industry and respecting the individual cultures of our agencies. With this in mind, we continue to transform the way we are organized in a manner that allows our management, people and agencies to effect change by offering clients the most creative solutions with access to the latest tools in the marketplace.","As you know, two years ago, we started the formation of individual practice areas together with our Global Client Leaders group to deliver to clients a single point of access to our network of thousands of industry specialists in specific marketing disciplines. With strong leadership in each of our practice areas, we can better collaborate and execute growth strategies across our key client metrics organization, strengthen our new business development efforts, share expertise and knowledge, create more career opportunities for our people and target our internal investments and acquisitions.","We have now substantially completed our transition to this new way of operating. Practice areas are in place for precision marketing and CRM, Healthcare, PR, global advertising, national advertising, brand consultancy, experiential marketing, shopper marketing, media and specialty marketing. I\u2019m pleased to report we continue to see terrific results from our practice areas. Omnicom Health Group for example recently launched the centralized powerful new database, called Insights 360. This data tool which is available to all of our clients through any of our health group agencies, combines information from over 15 healthcare data sources to establish a unique profile of nearly 2 million healthcare professionals in the United States. It enables our pharma and biotech clients to deliver personalized messages at scale to their key healthcare providers. We believe our healthcare offering is well ahead of our competition.","On the business development front, Proximity, one of our agencies within our precision marketing group teamed up with BBDO to win Bear\u2019s [ph] global companion animal business. The Global Client Leaders group played an integral role in orchestrating our agencies\u2019 efforts on this win. The assignment which includes several brands will be led by an integrated team based in Dusseldorf with additional local support from a number of BBDO agencies across Europe and the U.S. The win reflects the expanded capabilities we can offer to our clients by aligning our GCLs and practice areas to create personal and scalable experiences for their consumers.","We are also continuing to expand and strengthen our Global Client Leaders group with the focus on our top 100 clients. These leaders support our largest accounts fueled by programs that increase our ability to share intelligence and connect with partners. We recently expanded this team with new senior talent to increase coverage to our Healthcare clients and our multinational clients based in Europe. Our practice areas and Global Client Leaders all access our data, analytic and technology capabilities, many of them centrally developed by our Annalect unit, which are being used by our agencies to develop more effective communication strategies for our clients.","Over the past decade, we\u2019ve made substantial ongoing investments in Annalect, which now numbers more than a 1,000 professionals dedicated to developing superior analytical tools. In doing so, Annalect has become the foundation for developing transformative data base capabilities across the entire group. Recently, we unveiled the enterprise-wide capability called Omni, our first of a kind people based precision marketing and insights platform. The Omni name speaks to the depth and breadth of the platform across marketing communication functions and across our enterprise of agencies and practice areas. We expect it to be a central part of our group strategy in moving forward. Simply said, it is designed to identify and define personalized consumer experiences at scale in order to drive superior business outcomes for our clients. It transforms the way our teams work, collaborate and deliver value by providing a single view of the consumer in order to drive precision marketing at scale across creative, CRM, media and our other practice areas. Its functionality provides insight generation applications, audience building, planning at a strategic and tactical level, content inspiration, dynamic creative activation, optimized media inventory matching and reporting and an attribution all in one platform, supported by a single view of the consumer.","At the core of Omni, our identity sources from leading providers like Experian, LiveRamp, and Newstar among other large data providers and the platform can also plug into Omnicom\u2019s precision marketing group\u2019s first party data. This data can be used to build an audience at the most granule level and to identify content and consumption patterns in a way that is unique to any category and brand. Importantly, Omni continues our strategy of neutrality with no ownership interest in data or tech partners, in a fast-moving space and one with evolving regulatory and compliance requirements, the platform provides us with the agility to tap into whatever data or assets that work for our clients at any given point and make changes as required.","We\u2019ve talked a lot about delivering the right message to the right person at the right time to achieve the right outcome. We\u2019ve also talked about the highly personalized experience for the consumer. Omni gets us a leap closer to this promise on behalf of all of our clients across our entire enterprise accessible through a cloud-based open model. Turning now to new business, we are extremely pleased that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts has chosen BBDO to be its creative agency partner, overseeing advertising strategies and creative development across a broad range of platforms including broadcast, digital display, outdoor, print, social media and more. PHD won the global media planning and buying business of HSBC. In commenting on the win, HSBC said they had selected PHD for its strong strategic skills and advanced digital transformation capabilities.","We\u2019re also proud that Pizza Hut recently selected Austin-based GSD&M as its creative agency of record following a review launched in March. Our success in developing new solutions for our clients is a result of our best-in-class talent. With this in mind, I\u2019m very pleased to report, at this year\u2019s Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity Omnicom agencies continued their record of being the most creatively awarded in the industry. We swept the agency of the year category with Adam & Eve DDB at number one, AMV BBDO at number two, and BBDO New York at number three. BBDO won network of the year; DDB was number three; and TBWA was number four.","In total, 137 agencies from 34 countries won nearly 300 alliances across more than 25 communications disciplines. And as a result of the combination of our agencies\u2019 work, Omnicom won Holding Company of the Year. I want to congratulate everybody that helped this win in a big way at the Cannes this year. Our investment in talent and technology and partnership are the differentiator for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these areas as the marketing communication environment only gets more complex.","Turning to our operational initiatives. We remain focused on delivering efficiencies across the group. We are constantly challenging our people to find ways to manage their costs agency-by-agency.","On a regional and global basis, we\u2019re making good progress on our real estate, information technology, back office accounting services and procurement initiatives. These initiatives, which are complex and take multiple years to execute are ongoing. However, we do expect to take additional actions to accelerate progress in some of these areas during the third quarter.","In closing, we\u2019re pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter and remain on track to achieve our full-year 2018 targets. And as we said last quarter, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that the second half of the year will be stronger than the first.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our second quarter results. Phil?","Phil Angelastro","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our results for the second quarter of 2018 were in line with our expectations. Our agencies continue to meet our clients\u2019 needs and manage their costs in an ever-changing and highly competitive marketing landscape.","Starting on slide five. Our reported revenue for Q2 grew by 1.8% to a little under $3.9 billion. The components of that growth included organic revenue growth, which was 2% in the quarter or $77 million, bringing our six-month growth rate to 2.2%, which was closer to the lower end of our expectations for organic growth, 2% to 3% for the full year.","In regard to FX, the net impact of changes in currency rates increased reported revenue for the quarter by $79 million or 2.1%. The impact of dispositions net of the acquisition activity over the past year was slightly negative in the second quarter as we completed cycling through the disposal of Novus this past April. Acquisition revenue also included the recent acquisition of EMC Group in Japan. The net impact reduced our second quarter revenue by $38 million or about 1%.","We continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to identify areas for investment and acquisition opportunities as well as to identify non-strategic or underperforming businesses for disposition. We are currently in the process of completing several potential dispositions, primarily in our CRM Execution & Support discipline, the largest of which is Sellbytel, a European-based sale support business. We are also in the process of pursuing certain acquisitions, primarily in our CRM Consumer Experience discipline. Although this disposition in acquisition activity has not yet been completed, we expect revenue from disposition activity to exceed revenue from acquisition activity for the remainder of 2018.","Based on activity expected to be completed prior to September 30, 2018, the net reduction in revenue would be approximately 1% to 1.5% in the third quarter, 3% in the fourth quarter, and 2.5% for the full year. We\u2019re also in the process of accelerating certain operating efficiency and cost reduction activities which we expect to complete during the third quarter.","We expect the reduction to our earnings from the disposition activity we\u2019re considering to be substantially offset by the savings achieved from these operating efficiency and cost reduction activities, as well as an incremental earnings from new acquisition activity. The timing of the currently contemplated dispositions, acquisitions, and operating efficiency and cost reduction activity is subject to change.","And lastly, as we discussed in detail during our first quarter earnings call, we were required to adopt the FASB\u2019s new revenue recognition standard, known as ASC 606 effective beginning of this year. The impact of applying the new revenue recognition standard reduced our reported revenue by approximately $49 million or 1.3% for the quarter. I will discuss in more detail the drivers of the changes in revenue a little later in my remarks.","Turning back to slide one and the income statement items below revenue. Operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased to $582 million or 1.9% with operating margin of 15.1%, which was flat versus Q2 of last year. Our Q2 EBITA increased to $609 million or a 1.6%. And the resulting EBITA margin of 15.8% was also leveled with Q2 of last year. ASC 606 did have a minor impact on our operating profit due to a change in the timing of recognition of some of our incentive compensation from our clients. Had we followed the same revenue recognition rules as last year, our EBIT would have been higher in Q2 by about $7.5 million. But as we said in our Q1 call, because this change is principally timing related, we expect the net impact for the year to also be minor.","In addition to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, on January 1st we adopted ASU 2017-07, which reclassifies a proportion of our pension and post employment expense, primarily the interest related components from salary and service costs below operating income as part of interest expense. New accounting presentation requires us to restate the prior periods, so that they are comparable. The amount reclassed for both Q2 of \u201818 and Q2 of \u201817 was approximately $6 million. The reclassification of this expense does not have an impact on our pre-tax profit or net income.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $52.5 million, up $1.2 million versus the second quarter of 2017, and up $5.6 million versus $46.9 million reported in the first quarter of 2018. As previously discussed, beginning of this year, we adopted ASU 2017-07, and as a result, a portion of our pension and post employment expense is now included in net interest expense. And the prior year has been restated to be consistent with the current year\u2019s presentation. The impact of the reclassification in the second quarter of 2018 and 2017 is approximately $6 million. Gross interest expense in the second quarter was up about $3.6 million compared to last year\u2019s Q2, primarily due to the impact of increased interest expense on our floating rate swap, while interest income in the quarter increased $2.4 million versus the prior year due to higher interest earned on cash held by our international treasury center. When compared with Q1 of this year, interest expense in the second quarter increased by approximately $4.1 million with increased interest expense on our floating-rate swaps as well as increased rates on our commercial paper borrowing, and interest income decreased by $1.5 million.","Turning to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 25.8%. Primary driver of the lower effective rate is the lower U.S. tax rate, resulting from the enactment of the 2017 tax act which reduced the federal statutory tax rate to 21%. In addition, the decrease in the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a reduction of $12 million in the expected incremental U.S. tax applied against Omnicom\u2019s overall foreign earnings. As of now, we expected that the benefit from the tax act will reduce our effective tax rate by about 5% or to approximately 27.5% compared to our 32.4% rate in 2017, which excludes the net increase in tax expense recorded in 2017, the impact of the tax act and the reduction in tax expense resulting from the tax benefits realized in \u201817 from share-based compensation. We cannot predict the impact on our 2018 effective tax rate from share-based compensation because the subject changes in our share price and the impact of future stock option exercises.","Earnings from our affiliates totaled $1.7 million for the quarter, up slightly versus Q2 of last year. And the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries $30.6 million, up $4.1 million when compared to Q2 of last year. As a result, net income for the second quarter increased 10.8% to $364.2 million.","Now, turning to slide two. Income available for common shareholders for the quarter was $364.1 million. And our diluted share count for the quarter decreased 2.5% versus Q2 of last year 228.1 million. As a result, our diluted EPS for the quarter was a $1.60, up $0.20 or 14.3%.","On slides three and four, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. I\u2019ll just give you a few highlights. Organic revenue growth was 2.2% during the first six months of the year. FX increased revenue by 3.1%. The net impact from acquisitions and dispositions reduced revenue by 2.6% and the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 decreased revenue by 1.2%. So, for the year to date period, revenue totaled $7.5 billion, an increase of 1.5% compared to the first six months of 2017.","EBIT increased to just over $1 billion and our year-to-date operating margin of 13.4% was flat versus the first six months 2017, and our six-month diluted EPS was $2.73 per share, which is up $0.31 or 12.8% versus 2017.","Turning to slide five, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. As we discussed in detail during our Q1 call, after comprehensive review of the impact standard would have on our business including detailed reviews of our client compensation agreements, we determined that the new standard would not have a material impact on our revenue or operating results. While not material, the new standard did change the timing of the recognition of certain performance incentive provisions included in our client agreements. Previously, performance incentives were recognized as revenue when our performance against qualitative goals was acknowledged by the client or when specific quantitative goals were achieved. This often occurred on a lag, resulting in recognition of these incentives late in the year or early in the subsequent year.","The new standard requires these items to be estimated and included in the total consideration in the year that services are performed and to be evaluated throughout the contract period. Additionally, the new standard resulted in a reduction of revenue and operating expense in Q2 of \u201818, approximately $40 million in one of our CRM Consumer Experience agencies.","Because we adopted the new standard by the modified retrospective method of adoption, prior year results are not comparable. Accordingly, on slide 20, we present revenue for the quarter and year-to-date periods of 2018 without the impact of ASC 606. We estimate the impact of applying the new revenue recognition standard reduced our reported revenue in the second quarter of 2018 by $49 million and $91 million for the first six months of the year or 1.3% and 1.2% for both periods respectively. The impact on EBIT and our results from operations as well as the balance sheet and cash flow were not material.","For the full year, we continue to estimate a reduction in revenue of approximately $150 million. And as we mentioned earlier, had we followed the same revenue recognition rules as last year, our EBIT for Q2 would have been $7.5 million higher. However, because the impact on EBIT is principally timing related, we expect the net impact for the full year to be minor.","Turning to FX. While we saw the dollar strengthen against more currencies over the past three months, overall the U.S. dollar was weaker year-over-year against the basket of foreign currencies we operate in. The impact of changes in currency rates increased reported revenue by 2.1% or $79 million in revenue for the quarter. The largest FX movements from the quarter were from our euro and UK markets. Additionally, dollar weakened against the Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi, and the Canadian dollar. Partially offsetting those movements, dollar strengthened against the Brazilian reais, Russian ruble and the Turkish lira.","Looking forward, if currencies stay where they currently are, we anticipate that the FX impact on our reported revenue will turn negative during the remainder of the year, creating a headwind to our revenues of approximately 1% during the third quarter and the fourth quarter. For the full year, we\u2019re currently estimating the FX impact will remain positive by approximately 1%. The impact of our recent acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by $38 million in the quarter or 1%.","Early in the second quarter, we cycled through the disposal of Novus, a print media business which we sold in the second quarter of 2017. Part of our continuing evaluation of our portfolio of businesses, we recently announced the disposition of Sellbytel, our European sale support business. That transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018.","In addition to the Sellbytel disposition, we\u2019re currently considering other smaller dispositions in the third quarter as well as pursuing certain acquisition opportunities. As a result and as previously discussed, we expect the net reduction to our revenue of approximately 1% to 1.5% in the third quarter, 3% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year of 2018.","And finally, while mixed by geography and by discipline, our organic growth was positive on a global basis for the quarter, up $77 million or 2% for the second quarter. Geographically, our European and Asian regions continue to lead the way. While the U.S. was slightly negative by about 0.5%, sluggish performance by our Canadian agencies negatively impacted our North American performance in the quarter. From our disciplines, we saw strong results in our CRM Consumer Experience and healthcare businesses while our CRM Execution & Support businesses faced difficult comps to Q2 of 2017, lagged in the quarter.","Slide six shows our mix of business by discipline. The second quarter, the split was 54% for advertising and 46% marketing services. As for their organic growth by discipline, our advertising discipline was up 1.6%. Advertising\u2019s organic growth continues to be led by our media businesses, while our global and national advertising agencies continued to experience mix performance.","CRM Consumer Experience was up 7.1% for the quarter on a continuing strength of our events businesses in the U.S. and in Europe. Direct digital marketing and shopper marketing were also positive while branding lagged. CRM Execution & Support facing a difficult comparison to Q2 of 2017 from organic growth with 6.2% was negative for the quarter, sluggish performance from our research and specialty production agencies partially offset by solid growth in our not for profit consulting agencies.","PR was up 2.7%. Solid performances by our agencies in the U.S. and the UK led the way this quarter. Elsewhere, Continental Europe was also positive, while both Asia and Latin America were down again this quarter. And Healthcare was up 4.8%, continuing the improvement we\u2019ve seen since the beginning of the year. While this quarter\u2019s growth was driven by strong performances domestically and in Asia, we also saw positive growth across all regions.","On slide seven, which details the regional mix of business, you can see during the quarter, the split was 54% for North America, 9% for the UK, 20% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, 3% for Latin America, and the remainder in the Middle East and Africa markets.","Turning to the details of our performance by region. Organic revenue growth in North America was down 0.9% due to marginally negative performance from our U.S. businesses and weakness from our Canadian agencies. So, we saw strong positive performances from our CRM Consumer Experience, PR and Healthcare agencies. The advertising and CRM Execution & Support disciplines in the region continued their softness.","The UK was down 2.2% organically that was facing a difficult comp to Q2 of 2017 when organic growth in the market was over 9%. While advertising, media and PR all were up for the quarter, decreases in our field marketing, research and events businesses offset those performances.","The rest of Europe was up 11% organically in the quarter. In the region, France, Italy and Spain all had strong performances and we also so solid performances in Netherlands and Ireland while Germany continued to lag.","Organic growth in Europe outside the Eurozone continued to be positive as well. The Asia Pacific region was up 8.5% and we continue to see organic growth across our major markets in the region, including Australia, Greater China, India, New Zealand and South Korea, with Japan the only meaningful market underperforming this quarter.","Latin America had organic growth of 2.5% in the second quarter. Brazil continued its modest improvement, returning to positive organic growth for the first time since Q1 of 2017. However, the ongoing political turmoil presents a significant hurdle in that market. Elsewhere in the region, we saw solid growth in Mexico and Colombia. And Middle East and Africa, our smallest region, was down. As was the case last quarter, the decrease was driven by a reduction in media activity by our clients in the region and non-recurring projects within the events businesses in the region.","Turning to our cash flow performance. On slide 10 you can see that in the first half of the year, we generated almost $860 million of free cash flow including changes in working capital, an increase over the first six months of 2017.","As for our primary uses of cash on slide 11, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $278 million; dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders, $57 million. Capital expenditures totaled $90 million, primarily reflecting increased spending as we reconfigure our real estate footprint to be more efficient. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments totaled just under $300 million. And stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plan totaled $463 million and were in line with our repurchase activity during the first half of last year. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $324 million year-to-date.","Turning to slide 12, regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter. Our total debt is just a shade under $4.9 billion. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.97 billion, up $1.8 billion compared to yearend December 31, 2017. The increase in net debt was a result of typical uses of working capital that historically occur in the first half of the year. The use of our cash in excess of free cash flow of approximately $324 million and decreasing our cash balance related to the effective exchange rates, which reduced cash at June 30, 2018 by $114 million. Compared to June 30, 2017, our net debt is down a little over $100 million. Decrease was primarily the result of generating $75 million in free cash flow and by the changes in operating capital which positively impacted our cash by approximately $45 million over the past 12 months. This was partially offset by the effective exchange rates on cash over the past year, which reduced our cash balance by about $15 million. As for our debt ratios, they remain solid. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.1 times and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times. And due to the year-over-year increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio decreased 10.3 times, but remains quite strong.","Turning to slide 13. We continue to manage and build the Company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio was 20.2%, while our return on equity was 50.1%. Both ratios, particularly return on equity impacted year-over-year due to the additional tax charge we took in Q4 in connection with the passage of the tax act. But, we expect that impact to be more than offset by the positive impact the lower tax rate will have on our results as we move forward.","And finally, on slide 14, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10 plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2008 through June 30, 2018, which totals $10.6 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period was $11.3 billion, resulting in a cumulative payout ratio well in excess of 100% over the last decade.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we\u2019ve included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we\u2019re going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first is going to come from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi. Thank you very much. I guess, first off, how much will the divestitures of the CRM execution businesses allow for some improvement in organic growth in the U.S.? I think, Sellbytel is mostly a European business. Maybe you can clarify that. But it sounds like there is other big businesses you hope to divest to sort of alleviate some of the pressure on U.S. organic growth. So, I guess any color on that. And then, I have a follow-up.","Phil Angelastro","Yes. I think, Alexia, Sellbytel is an international business, not really U.S. presence. But some of the disposals that we\u2019re contemplating certainly have a U.S. presence. And if we look at the actual performances on the second quarter and the first quarter of this year, if the disposals that we\u2019re contemplating had been completed at that time, we would have better growth in North America. We don\u2019t have an exact number. It probably wouldn\u2019t have been that significant. But, we\u2019re looking at and contemplating these disposals just like Sellbytel not just because of current performance but because of our expectations in the future as far as whether we\u2019re going to invest or where we\u2019re going to invest and what we think strategically these businesses mean for our longer term clients. So, it\u2019s both or it\u2019s primarily strategic reevaluation, but it\u2019s also current performance in many of these cases as well.","John Wren","The other thing I might add to that Alexia is that on some of the acquisitions we hope to close, they tend -- for the most part they are domestic in nature and they have growth rates which will contribute to our overall performance in North America.","Alexia Quadrani","And then, when you look at your guidance for the back half of the year, hoping for some acceleration organic growth, I know that sort of -- I believe that\u2019s a global number, not specific to U.S., but I think, it does mostly imply some improvement in the U.S. I\u2019m wondering what the puts and takes are. Is there better new business tailwind in the back half of the year? I guess, any other color you can give us why the U.S. organic might begin to improve aside from the contributions of acquisitions or the benefit of divestitures?","John Wren","I know that new business for the quarter was probably was higher than -- or has been recently at $1.5 billion, I haven\u2019t done the work, maybe Phil knows, to look to see what part of the world that comes from.","Phil Angelastro","We don\u2019t analyze it that way. So, we expect it to be kind of distributed consistent with our global operations, but we haven\u2019t broken it down by region.","John Wren","If some of the things like -- some of the pressure that we\u2019ve had in programmatic area has been primarily in the United States where we are going from bundled to unbundled, that pressure abates a bit as we get into the second half based upon all the information that we have currently. So, there are a couple of -- there are quite a number of puts and takes in being cautiously optimistic about the second half. But, we tend to look at the whole enterprise, not just a particular region.","Alexia Quadrani","Okay. And anything specific on U.S. advertising that you might not have highlighted that was particularly soft in the quarter. The advertising itself, business?","Phil Angelastro","I think, it\u2019s a combination of things. I think we certainly have some agencies in the U.S. that have done well and did well in the quarter. We\u2019ve got some others that have lost some clients recently and others that perhaps is timing in terms of clients scaling back in the current quarter and moving their spending to future periods, although we\u2019re not certain and definitive that those numbers are for sure going to be significantly better in the second half. I think we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. But at this point, we don\u2019t anticipate changing our expectations for the year.","Operator","And we also have a question from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research. Please go ahead.","Craig Huber","Thank you. I have a few questions. Let me start off over Europe if I could. I\u2019m curious to hear your updated thoughts on this GDPR or regulatory change over there in terms of clients or change in their behavior in terms of how much digital advertise replacing in Europe. In particular, I was curious to hear if any major changes going on with spend through Facebook and Google on behalf of your clients. Has that changed much in say the last two months with this regulatory change?","John Wren","I\u2019m going to turn it to Jonathan Nelson.","Jonathan Nelson","Hi, Craig. Thanks for the question. We have not seen a huge change in terms of GDPR and how it\u2019s affected our business. Of course, we\u2019re complying with all the regulatory issues. But, we expect our Google and Facebook spend to continue and our systems are built to work fully with GDPR compliance situation.","Craig Huber","Okay. Then also, while we\u2019re still talking about Europe, it had very strong growth there for a while and for continent and stuff. Is much of that being fueled by net new wins over there or just some more meat on the bones if you would?","Phil Angelastro","I think it\u2019s a combination of things. I think we\u2019ve got some strong agencies in many of those markets that have been performing really well, ultimately. Some of that\u2019s due to wins, some of that\u2019s due to projects, some of that\u2019s due to good management. But, I think there are still going to be ebbs and flows as we saw in the UK this quarter. The UK has had some strong performance for quite a long time now, and they were up against some difficult comps, but I think overall it\u2019s a number of factors.","John Wren","There\u2019s probably a higher concentration, larger revenues in our CRM execution side of the business in the United States, to some extent in Northern Europe, and those are the ones we\u2019re taking a critical look at in terms of what they\u2019re going to contribute to our business strategically going forward. And correspondingly, we\u2019re looking to make acquisitions in CRM precision side of the business because we think that will benefit us as we move forward in helping our clients.","Craig Huber","And then, also, maybe just talk about, not individual clients but sectors of clients and how they performed in the quarter? Curious in particular to hear about CPG companies and food and beverage guys collectively on an organic basis, and what your sort of outlook is collectively for that group? Do you see any material maybe optimism there at all, is it still quite a ways out?","John Wren","Well, fortunate for us that it\u2019s not a very large portion of our revenue base but they\u2019ve certainly been under an incredible amount of pressure in terms of what\u2019s happening to their business in terms of new competitors, both directly on the product side but also in the distribution side. So, it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t see any -- any immediate turnaround in that area. I see just continuing pressure for the foreseeable future and specifically in that sector.","Phil Angelastro","And there hasn\u2019t been -- overall, there hasn\u2019t been that much movement in terms of our revenue by industry group. So, certainly some clients and some of our businesses have done better than others, depending on mix of their clients. But it\u2019s pretty broad, diverse portfolio. And we haven\u2019t seen dramatic swings one way or the other in the types of industries that our clients are in that are driving our growth.","Craig Huber","So, would you include auto in that comment as well?","Phil Angelastro","I would. I think, there\u2019s currently a few opportunities that we\u2019re pursuing in auto. So, I think we look at that vertical as certainly an opportunity for us in the future.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Julien Roch with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julien Roch","Yes. Good morning. My first question is, could we have the impact of Accuen on organic in Q2?","Phil Angelastro","Sure, worldwide Accuen was down about $7 million in revenue, $5 million of that was in the U.S.","Julien Roch","Okay. The second question is on the assets you\u2019re selling. I assume that the impact on 2019 will be about 3% in Q1 and Q2, and 1.5 in Q3. Can you confirm that?","Phil Angelastro","I think that\u2019s probably not too far off. I think we\u2019re at a point right now where we typically don\u2019t comment unless we close transactions whether they\u2019d be acquisitions or dispositions and project what those numbers are going to be. But, I think that\u2019s assuming we do the acquisitions and dispositions that we currently planned, although there is no guarantees. That\u2019s probably the reasonable estimate.","Julien Roch","Okay. And then, following up on your answer to Alexia. You said that if you had already sold those assets, organic would have been higher. But, is it possible to know are you talking about couple of tens of basis points higher, are you talking about 1% higher? I mean, some idea of the impact on group organic. And I guess also, all those businesses with higher or lower margin than the group average?","Phil Angelastro","So, on the growth point, I think if you look at the current quarter, the number probably would be less than 50 basis points was the impact. And then, with respect to margins, dispositions, couple of points, I guess. Dispositions, we\u2019re considering and Sellbytel being the largest, which we expect to close by the end of August. Margins overall are probably consistent with Omnicom\u2019s overall average margin. Although, it\u2019s a little bit too early, because we\u2019re not certain exactly when and which deals we\u2019re going to close as well as what the impacts for certain of acquisitions is going to be. However, I think as you look to Q4 and beyond, given we\u2019ll have a lower revenue base and we expect to be neutral from an earnings perspective, given the operating efficiency and cost reduction efforts that we\u2019re planning. I think, the math works that there will be some margin improvement due to the disposals and due to the fact that we have a lower amount of revenue. We typically focus and continue to focus on EBITA; it\u2019s not a margin percentage. And we\u2019ll continue to do that. But in terms of a range, we don\u2019t really have one yet, but it\u2019s -- there will be some benefit we would expect. How significant it\u2019s going is to be to be determined.","Julien Roch","Okay. And final question on the disposals. So, two years ago, you sold about 5% of Omnicom; this year you\u2019re selling 3%, so that\u2019s about 8% already. Once you\u2019ve redone completely your review program, what percentage do you think of the Company you would have sold? Are we talking 10%, 15%, to have a sense of what will happen in the next couple of years?","Phil Angelastro","I think, it\u2019s hard to predict. I think, if you look at \u201817, the net disposition number was about 4%; \u201818, our current expectations, our estimate is 2.5%. We\u2019re going to continue to pursue the same strategy. And to the extent there are opportunities that make sense for us, do acquisitions that are accretive, we\u2019re going to do that; to the extent there are disposition opportunities that we think strategically are the right thing to do for the business going forward, we\u2019re going to take advantage of those opportunities. We don\u2019t really have a bogey in mind just like for acquisitions, we don\u2019t have an acquisition bogie and then have people chase deals to meet the target and they\u2019re not the right deals from a disposition perspective, our approach isn\u2019t very different.","So, I can\u2019t tell you right now exactly how it\u2019s going to play out. We are going to continue to revaluate portfolio and the reality of that is, given the nature and the speed of the change that\u2019s been occurring in the industry, it\u2019s been an ongoing process that will continue to be an ongoing process. Whether it results in more executed dispositions or not, it\u2019s to be determined.","Julien Roch","And last one, your working capital was $300 million worse in the first half. Do you expect the deterioration for the full year, or will blocking and tackling means no change to working capital for the full year?","Phil Angelastro","I think, the number was, I think 300 to a little high, there was a one-time acceleration of U.S. bonus payments that we made in Q1 that we otherwise would have made in Q2. I\u2019d say Q2 was relatively flat in terms of our performance after adjusting for that. So, we\u2019re still down through six months. Our goal is certainly to make up for that in the second half. But, I think we\u2019re also making -- we\u2019re also trying to make sure from a day-to-day perspective that we don\u2019t lose any more ground. But, I\u2019m not sure sitting here today whether we\u2019re going to make up the number from the first half or from the first quarter or not fully by the end of the year. But that\u2019s certainly our goal.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of David Joyce with Evercore. Please go ahead.","David Joyce","Thank you. If you could just help to frame for us related to your Omni suite and announcement there. Where are you on the predictive data analytics and in terms of that competitive offering vis-\u00e0-vis the more technology oriented competitors that have a predictive capability?","John Wren","Jonathan?","Jonathan Nelson","Thanks for the question, David. In regards to Omni, essentially what it is, is we\u2019re using customer data to profile customers and to predict what kind of information they want to see from a creative and messaging point of view, and then connecting that to where they are in the media landscape. We\u2019re using multiple artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to do both of those things. And we believe that it is a state-of-the-art for the buy side. And we are working with many of our sell side partners, Amazon, Google to incorporate some of their algorithmic technology as well as adding our own. So, all-in, it\u2019s an open platform that incorporates some of the best technologies available in the marketplace.","John Wren","And operator, given the market is just opened, I think we have time for one more call.","Operator","And then, our final question will come from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks. I have obviously one quick for Phil and one for Jonathan. Phil, could you size -- I think you\u2019re trying the size the impact of those cost actions. And when is the first quarter that will see the benefit of those class reductions?","Phil Angelastro","I think, from a timing perspective, we expect to complete the bulk of the actions by the end of the third quarter. So, we certainly hope to see and expect to see the ongoing benefit starting in Q4 at some point. We may not be done right at the end of Q3, but certainly we\u2019ll see it in Q4 and then on into 2019. And in terms of the dollar amount, I think I don\u2019t have the exact dollar amount to give you other than from a target perspective, based on the dispositions we actually get done. And the overall profile from an Omnicom perspective of our margins, you can probably do the math and assume that the goal is to keep our EBIT dollars consistent to the extent that we can take advantage of the actions that we\u2019re pursuing right now.","Michael Nathanson","Got it. And then, quick one for Jonathan. I guess, the big news over the past month was IPA2 [ph] exit from Axiom. [Ph] I wondered did you guys look at acquiring that asset. And how do you see this in general, the strategy of building your own data versus maybe renting it? So, can you just talk us through philosophically how do you see, deals like Axiom and what\u2019s your strategy been relative to that?","Jonathan Nelson","Yes. We did look at it. We have fallen on the side of renting the data versus buying the company that compiles the data. We see data as commodity. In fact when you look at the Omni platform, we announced deals with LiveRamp, with Newstar and with Experian, all of which have similar first party style data,. We just believe that this enhances our position of neutrality and removes any perceived conflict we might have with our direct clients.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. Thank you.","John Wren","Thank you.

Welcome to the Omnicom Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I'd now like to introduce you to today's conference call host, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Omnicom Group, Mr. Randall Weisenburger. Please go ahead.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our second quarter 2012 earnings call. We hope everyone's had a chance to review our earnings release. We have posted to our website both the press release and a presentation covering the information that we'll be presenting this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I've been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that's included at the end of our investor presentation and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectations, and actual events or results may differ materially.","I'd also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our performance. You can find a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.","We're going to begin the call with some brief remarks from John Wren. Following John's remarks, we'll review our financial performance for the quarter, and then both John and I will be happy to take questions.","John D. Wren","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call. I'd like to spend my time this morning by starting with our latest business results, give you my thoughts on the current environment and discuss our expectations for the rest of 2012.","I'm happy to say that we had another strong quarter, especially when you consider some of the economic headwinds out there. We continue to deliver above average organic growth, and we remain very much on track to achieve our margin objectives for the year.","For the second half, we are cautiously optimistic about revenues. We recognize that there are risks in a number of regions that could impact global growth. On the risk side, the situation in Europe remains tenuous. In the U.S., continuing fiscal concerns, unemployment and the upcoming elections create uncertainty. In Asia, even though overall growth is still quite attractive, the pace of their economic growth is also moderating. On the plus side, central banks in the U.S., Europe and Asia are acting in a manner that supports growth. And in our conversations with our clients, their focus remains on building their businesses around the world.","We continue to keep an eye on the macroeconomic picture, but as I said last quarter, we are most focused on the things we can control. Even as we tightly manage our costs, we are making smart investments in our people, our service capabilities and our geographic footprint. These investments don't always make headlines themselves, but they are helping us to consistently win new business and to extend our existing client relationships.","Across all of our networks and agencies, we are investing in talented people who are helping us to broaden our capabilities and service offerings and to fulfill our commitment to differentiating creative and executional excellence on behalf of our clients. This was most recently illustrated by our outstanding performance at the International Festival of Creativity in Cannes, where Omnicom agencies from 34 countries won more than 200 Lions, representing over 90 clients. I want to congratulate all of our agencies on their performance.","The future of our industry belongs to those organizations that can deliver integrated solutions for clients. The marketplace is getting more complex. Consumers are blurring the lines between offline and online. New technologies offer greater opportunities to effectively communicate with customers, and in my opinion, we're only at the beginning. We are just learning how to effectively utilize social media and smartphone technology.","To be successful, agencies must increasingly blend all these media, together with a deep understanding of data and analytics, to help their clients find and serve customers where they are and the way they want. And our agencies must be agile enough to keep learning and changing as technology does. Our entire digital strategy is built around this idea: build the expertise in every agency, make sure we are not weighted to any single technology and integrate these capabilities to better service our clients.","In a recent example of our approach, in late June, TBWA announced the formation of the Digital Arts Network. Digital Arts Network unifies TBWA's proven digital talent, encompassing over 700 digital specialists in the network and initially rolling it out in 18 markets, a global footprint to rival any pure play digital shop. This talent will remain fully integrated within TBWA's existing business.","Now I'd like to turn my attention to the second quarter. Organic growth for the quarter was a very strong 5.1%. We experienced positive growth in every major region around the world with the exception of the euro markets. Organic growth in our international markets outside of the euro was almost 9%. Our advertising business continued to perform very well, and our CRM business also had solid growth.","Looking more closely at revenue by geography. We saw a continued strength in the U.S. with organic growth of 5.4%. U.S. growth was driven by strong results in advertising, branding, media and sports and event marketing. Offsetting this was a decline in our healthcare and specialty businesses. The U.K. experienced organic growth of 3.2%.","The U.K. has been a consistently strong market for us, and during the quarter, we further improved our position through the acquisition of adam&eve, which is being combined with DDB U.K. adam&eve creativity and vision align perfectly with our culture and adds world-class talent to what is already one of our premier offices and markets.","Given the continued challenges in Europe, euro region growth was negative, although the performance by market again varied. Germany and France were relatively flat. The more troubled euro markets also had a difficult quarter, with Portugal being the exception. Outside the euro currency area, Russia and Turkey had very strong performances. In Asia, we had double-digit growth, with Australia, China, Japan, India and Singapore all exhibiting very strong performance.","Across our industry segments, we experienced solid results with auto, consumer products, retail and technology among the better-performing sectors. And net new business was over $1 billion for the second quarter.","Turning to our capital structure. We're delivering on our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet while making shareholders the major beneficiaries of Omnicom's strong cash flows. During the quarter, we raised $750 million in new debt at today's historically low rates, and we spent more than $550 million in share repurchases, bringing the total for the year to over $800 million.","Even with this new debt, our balance sheet remains extremely solid, giving us the flexibility to pursue smart investments and acquisitions. We continue to seek acquisitions that allow us to further our strategic goals and that meet the test of fit and price that we deem necessary for our success. We are committed to maintaining this disciplined approach.","Before I finish, I want to reiterate that we are on track to delivering our 2012 margin target. At the same time, we continue to balance these improvements with smart investments that will drive our growth that focus on delivering greater value for our clients and our shareholders.","Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our performance during the quarter. Despite the broad challenges in many regions of the world, our agencies are delivering solid growth with a sharp focus on cost and margins. We're doing this by continuing to provide their clients with world-class services using new mediums and technologies that integrate digital into their core capabilities.","I will now turn the call back to Randy, who will take you through the numbers in more detail and then be available for questions. Thanks.","Randall J. Weisenburger","As John said, our agencies had an excellent performance in Q2, benefiting from their hard work and the delivery of innovative and insightful services to their clients. As a result, revenue came in at $3.6 billion, which was driven by very strong organic growth of 5.1% in the face of a stiff FX headwind of 3.7%. I'm going to address our revenue growth in more detail in a few minutes.","EBITA increased 3.7% to $530 million. Strong organic revenue growth in the quarter combined with benefits of the many cost initiatives that our agencies have undertaken resulted in our EBITA margin expanding about 20 basis points this quarter to 14.9%. As we've previously stated, our objective for the full year is to match our 2007 margin performance, which was 13.4%. With the combined results through Q2, we're right on track to achieve that objective.","Operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased 3.7% to $506 million, and the resulting operating margin of 14.2% was also a year-over-year improvement of about 20 basis points.","Looking at the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $34.9 million, up $7.3 million from Q2 of last year and up $5.7 million from the first quarter. During the second quarter, we issued $750 million of 10-year senior notes with an annual coupon of 3 5\/8%. Both the year-over-year and the quarter-over-quarter increase in interest expense is predominantly due to the interest paid on the new bond.","On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%, in line with Q2 of last year and in line with our expected operating tax rate for this year. As a result of that, net income for the quarter increased 2.8% to $282.7 million.","On Slide 3, we show the computation of diluted EPS. The increase in net income combined with the year-over-year reduction in our diluted share count of just over 4% resulted in diluted EPS for the quarter of $1.02, which was an increase of 6.3%.","Now on Slide 4, we take a closer look at our revenue performance, first with regard to FX. On a year-over-year basis, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against most of our major currencies in the quarter. The net result reduced revenue in the quarter by $130 million or 3.7%.","As we've discussed in the past, the majority of our costs are incurred in the same currency as our revenues. As a result, the FX impact on our revenue flows pro rata through to our earnings, having a negligible effect on our operating margin. Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are currently, we expect FX to be negative by about 4.3% in Q3 and negative about 2.3% in Q4.","Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $25 million in the quarter or 7\/10 of 1%. In addition to a handful of smaller acquisitions, this quarter, we continued to benefit from the Mudra, Marina Maher and DDB Turkey acquisitions that we completed in the fourth quarter of last year. I should also point out that Q2 was the first quarter that we fully lapped the Clemenger and Communispace acquisitions, which we completed in 2011.","There are also a number of dispositions that we completed during the second half of 2011 that will continue to offset our acquisition revenue through the balance of the year. At this point, if we don't complete another acquisition or disposition for the balance of the quarter, that acquisition revenue will be positive about 1\/2 of 1% in Q3.","And finally, with regard to organic growth, we had another excellent quarter of 5.1% or $179 million. This quarter, organic revenue was driven by a combination of factors, with 3 that are worth noting. Our first, our agencies have continued to successfully develop innovative services utilizing the many new technologies and communications platforms being created in the market. Second, very strong new business wins over the past 2 or 3 quarters and again this quarter, with net wins just over $1 billion. And third, our agencies in many of the emerging markets, in particular in China, Russia and India, have continued to generate exceptional growth.","Turning to our mix of business on Slide 5. Brand advertising accounted for 48% of our revenue, and marketing services, 52%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising's organic growth was 7.1%, driven by strong growth in our media businesses, emerging markets and the development of our digital capabilities, as I mentioned.","Marketing services was up 3.3%. Within marketing services, CRM had a strong 5.8% organic growth, and within CRM, events, driven in part by Olympic-related activities, and branding were the fastest-growing subcategories. Public relations posted organic growth of about 1%, and specialty communications decreased 5.2%, primarily due to generally reduced spending by a number of our leading pharma accounts.","On Slide 6 and 7, our geographic mix of business in the quarter was split 52% domestic and 48% international. In the United States, revenue increased $95 million or 5.4%. Organic growth continued to be strong, generally across disciplines and industries, generating 5.4% growth or, again, about $96 million. Acquisitions net of dispositions was effectively neutral.","International revenue decreased $22 million or about 1.3%. FX provided a strong headwind, causing revenue to decline 7.6% or $130 million. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue $25 million, and organic growth, although very mixed by region, continue to be strong overall at 4.8% or adding about $83 million to revenue.","In Europe, of the larger countries, Russia continued to perform very well. The U.K. remained steady with 3.2% growth, and Germany and France were basically flat. Overall, the Eurozone markets were down about 1.5% organically. In Asia, we had strong performances across the region with double-digit growth in each of Australia, China, India, Japan and Singapore, and Latin America continue to turn in solid results, with standout performances in both Mexico and Chile this quarter.","Slide 8 shows our mix of business by industry. And as the chart shows, there is no significant changes in either the year-over-year or quarter-on-quarter analysis, which is generally what we expect given the large diversified base of business that we have. As for growth rates, we had strong performances in the quarter in the auto, retail and consumer product sectors.","Turning to Slide 9. Our cash performance for the first 6 months of the year was very good. We generated $664 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital.","On Slide 10, the breakdown of our primary uses of cash for the 6 months included dividends to our common shareholders of about $154 million. The year-over-year increase reflects the 20% increase we made to our quarterly dividend at the beginning of the year, dividends paid to minority interest shareholders of $57 million and capital expenditures of $113 million.","As I pointed out last quarter, CapEx this year is up a bit year-over-year, primarily due to a couple of sizable office moves and the long-term lease renewals. Acquisitions, including earnout payments, net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments totaled $99 million, and share repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $570 million. All-in, we overspent our free cash flow by about $329 million for the 6 months, which is in line with our expectations.","Slide 11 shows our current capital structure. As everyone is aware, we issued $750 million in 10-year senior notes with an annual coupon of 3 5\/8% interest early in the quarter. As a result, our total debt increased to $3.9 billion. However, our net debt position at the end of the quarter is basically flat from a year ago at $2.24 billion.","As a result of the increased debt, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2x, although our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, due to increased EBITDA, improved to 1.1x, and our interest coverage ratio also improved, due to our higher EBITDA, to 12.4x.","And finally, on Slide 12, as we continue to successfully build the company through a combination of prudently priced acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives, our return on invested capital and return on equity have remained very strong. In the last 12 months, our return on invested capital improved to 16% and our return on equity improved to 28.2%.","This concludes our prepared remarks. There are several other supplemental slides included in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, I'm going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. I guess one for John and one for Randy. John, could you give us a bit more color on, I guess, what advertisers' tone is for the second half as far as just incrementally nervous, or are they generally comfortable with their existing spending plans, both in the U.S., and then if you saw anything directionally interesting or different in the larger euro markets, France and Germany? And then Randy, just a follow-up question, if you could touch -- update us on your priorities for use of cash, if you think you'll be more acquisitive in the back half of the year.","John D. Wren","Most advertisers are still comfortable with their spending levels for 2012. Although with the currencies acting the way they are and all the uncertainties out there, it's always subject to -- a good portion of their spending is subject to review. Most clients are focused on revenue growth and especially in those areas of the world where there's a rising middle class. And the United States performed, as you know, from our numbers, performed better than probably what GDP will come in at. So on balance, I would say there's cautious optimism, but everyone's aware of the headwinds that exist.","Randall J. Weisenburger","And as far as acquisitions, I don't know that we'll be that much more acquisitive in the second half. We've -- we completed a couple of deals the first half. Right at the beginning of the third quarter, we completed an acquisition called NIM in China. It was a good-sized acquisition, good-sized for us, a digital business. We're always focused on -- I think John's terminology was fit and price. Obviously, any acquisition we look has to culturally fit and fit with our strategy. And keeping with our character, we believe in creating value for our shareholders, so pricing is pretty important.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then any incremental data points on what you're seeing in the Eurozone? I mean, is there, I guess, anything that you saw in the quarter that would make you particularly more concerned about Q3, or is it, you think at this point, more of the same?","John D. Wren","Europe continues to kick the can down the road, so there's constant uncertainty. If there is anything that is true every morning, it's that you don't know what today will bring. So we're cautious. We remain cautious. We remain in contact with our clients. Many of them based in Europe are multinational. So their spending is not exactly in Europe. They're able to move it around to where there's growth. So euro is going to be a question, I think, for a long time. I'm just learning to live with it.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of John Janedis from UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Randy, you highlighted the autos being up about 20%, which is an acceleration from the first quarter. With some of the weakness in the European auto sales, what are you hearing out of the markets for the category? And maybe from a credit or client perspective, do you see any early parallels today in Europe relative to the U.S. back in '08?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Wow. I think in the auto sector, in particular, I think most of it was our performance. I think our agencies did a good job. I think our clients are doing fairly well, and I think we're gaining some market share or business with them. I don't really see -- as far as your second part of the question, I don't see the analogy going back to 2008, frankly. I think the big dip in auto at that time was really availability of consumer credit, and I don't see that contracting at the current time. I don't necessarily see it expanding rapidly, but it seems fairly stable at this point.","John D. Wren","Overall, if I might -- this is John. If I could just remind you, this time last year, Japan was still suffering from the tsunami, so there wasn't as much product to meet demand, and that's been restored for the most part. Some of our clients are actually Japanese, so it's contributed a little bit to the growth that you see.","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Old subject here, but can you talk a little bit about the flattening out of margins over the 4 quarters for this year versus like what happened back in 2007? What's sort of driving that, please?","John D. Wren","World's a different place than it was in 2007, but I'll let Randy go.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think our margins will track over the course of the year along with 2007. We were a little bit ahead in the first quarter. We brought it, I think, perfectly in line through the 6 months. I think the balance of the year will largely track. I mean, the third quarter's a -- traditionally been a lower-margin quarter because it's a smaller revenue quarter. Yes, we could have 20 or 30 basis points swing around the third quarter, I would guess. But again, we've committed to hitting the number for the full year. We're right on track to doing that. I'm very confident that we'll be able to.","Craig Huber","And also just further on margins. If you think about your traditional business versus the digital technology work that you guys do, what's your updated thoughts on the margins for the 2 different areas? Are they still pretty similar in your mind, or longer term, maybe there's more upside on the digital technology side?","John D. Wren","I'd say that, currently, there's not a great deal of difference between the 2. Technology, digital, as you're referring to it, is integrated into every single campaign, everything that we touch. It requires different skill sets, and it also adds to the pace of the work and how long the work can exist before it has to be refreshed and redone. So the world's a complex place, and not everything digital has a perfect ROI yet. It will. So until we get to then, I don't see any grand distinction between one or the other. A matter of fact, we don't see any distinction between use of digital and some of the -- what you referred to as the more traditional channels to reach consumers.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think if there is a difference in -- digital is, again, a broad word. It means, obviously, lots of different things. On our labor-related businesses, we're going to get very similar margins. In some of the new technology spaces, we're making investments in technology platforms. We expect to get a return on the investment in the platform as well as a return on the labor. In those circumstances, because we'll make a bigger investment in that platform, maybe the margins will actually appear to be higher because we're getting that joint return, but that's just a matter of timing. We're really focused more on a return on our capital, and I think that'll be pretty similar.","Craig Huber","And also just 2 quick housekeeping questions, if I could. Could you break out salary in the office and general line for us? And then also, what was your actual shares you bought back in the quarter, not the net, but the actual number, please?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Let me get those -- let's keep going on. We'll get those answers. And we'll say them on -- following one of the other questions.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Leo Kulp with Citigroup.","Leo Kulp - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about how you think recent privacy initiatives, notably the potential for IE 10 to have Do Not Tracks as default, could impact your digital businesses and the broader digital market?","John D. Wren","Well, we do have privacy experts who follow this and, certainly, send me an email every day as to the state of the state. There is no question that we've always been conservative in terms of what technology will permit you to do and what you do, do in respecting the privacy laws, which are different market to market. It's a big unknown question as to what the future of that is, especially as mobile technology starts to take hold and we start to utilize it more to reach consumers.","Randall J. Weisenburger","But keep in mind those are the rules that you practice under. It's not going to change our business. These are very interesting communication mediums or platforms. Our clients and our firms will develop services to reach consumers over those platforms under the appropriate rules. It shouldn't change our business. It'll just change, again, the engagement rules. It's not going to change the desire of those mediums or our profitability. Going back to answering Craig's question, looks like we bought almost 11 million shares during the quarter. And as far as the breakout of salary and service and office and general, it was $2.541 billion in salary and service and $513 million in office and general.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of James Dix with Wedbush.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Three things. I guess as you sit here now, and compared to 3 months ago, are there any variances in your outlook for organic growth by geography that are worth calling out versus what you thought they would be 3 months ago? And then secondly, are you seeing any more volatility in any of your more cyclical client categories? For example, I noticed that travel and entertainment spending was down in the second quarter, although there may have been some client-specific things driving that. But I was curious on that point. And then finally, I mean, it sounds to me like you continue to have more confidence in what your full year margin will be as opposed to exactly what your organic growth is going to be. Correct me if I'm wrong on that point, but I'm just wondering if, at this stage, in going through the rationalization of your business and closing things down and adjusting costs, what you see is kind of the flex that you have in terms of managing your operating expense to adjust to any changes or surprises in organic growth?","John D. Wren","I think I said in the first quarter call, and I think I repeated it earlier, we remain cautiously optimistic about our revenues. The -- as macroeconomic areas change, as governments, which are increasingly important, and the outcome of how economies and regions perform get involved in the action and the pace of which they get, this is a constant process. My feelings -- my overall feeling guiding the firm hasn't changed. My input changes every morning, and so we make appropriate adjustments where we can. It's a difficult time, given the level of global growth, and it's going to remain that way, I think, for a little while before it gets straightened out. But I think historically, you can look at performance of this management team, not only the people talking to you today, but the people running the companies, and see that even in more dire times, we've been able to do a superb job in adjusting our costs to whatever economic conditions we seem to face. And I'm sorry, I missed the middle of your question, so...","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Sure. Just -- are you seeing any more volatility in some of the more economically cyclical client categories? And then I noted in particular, the travel and entertainment spending was actually down in the quarter.","John D. Wren","I didn't look at it.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I don't think so. I mean, I think we see some stronger sectors, some of the technology areas. When clients are coming out with new products, I think we're seeing marketing spend following those. The other sectors, I think, are driven more by our operating performance, business wins and\/or losses, that we can grow -- that we're growing our share, growing our revenue different than the economic growth in those underlying sectors.","John D. Wren","If it's all right with you, we'll go on while we look for the travel explanation. It could be client related. I don't know it off the top of my head, and then we'll answer it when we find it.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","One for Randy and one for John. Randy, on the buyback, your net repurchases really stepped up in the quarter. I'm wondering if we should expect or you expect your pace of repurchases to more track the first half of this year in terms of overspending free cash flows you mentioned in your opening remarks, or should we expect that pace to sort of mirror last year's, where I think the second half wasn't as -- didn't have as much repurchase activity as the first half did. And a follow-up for John.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think we'll probably track more or less like we did last year. That's what we said all along, that we would probably get to about this level, probably through the third quarter, which is somewhat of a smaller quarter, see how the year plays out, utilize most of our free cash and then we'll see what's happening in the fourth quarter.","John D. Wren","Just 2 things I would add to that. There's -- number one, there are a number of acquisitions out there that almost meet all our criteria, with the possible exception of fantasy pricing, from my point of view. So we'll see how it goes. There's things that I'd -- that I would invest in if I thought we get the proper return. So that enters into our thinking. And what we do is -- we have a board meeting later this week. We discuss this with our board, and when it comes to share repurchases, we have their authorization, but we seek their guidance constantly in terms of where we should be.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I would just -- that's an interesting point about trying to figuring out why there isn't more of a surge in M&A with the credit markets so accommodating. John, I was just wondering, this fantasy pricing, do you think that's -- do you think it's more because the credit markets are so accommodating, the sellers don't feel a sense of urgency? It just feels like these private market multiples are off the charts. What gives their -- since you bring it up, wonder what you think is going on.","John D. Wren","Yes. I wish I could give you a very crisp answer to that, and I can't. Some people are paying for -- to strategically broaden their platforms, or they look internally and they see deficiencies in the service capabilities that they have, and so they buy. I've seen in quite a number of recent deals where there's no competitor in the bidding for these companies, and the buyers are, I think, overpaying. Now I've been the CEO and I've been with this company for a long time, and so I never celebrate the purchase as much as I figure out how I'm going to repay my shareholders for the investment that I'm making. So it enters very heavily into our equation, and we've been pretty consistent over the years. And when you compare our results and what we've been able to do organically by investing in our company and our people, we haven't really been deficient and we haven't missed much, or I would say, we haven't missed anything. But I'm sure there's something we've missed. So I'm sorry, I'd probably do something else if I could answer that question better.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Just one last one for me, John. Within advertising, a couple of folks have asked about digital. You've said the spending on mobile just isn't there yet, I think you said in the past. And just even in the past quarter, it feels like we've had this explosion in handsets and devices globally. And so I'm wondering from your clients if you've seen any sort of pickup in interest in activity in mobile ad spend?","John D. Wren","I haven't seen a shift in the dollars yet, just an awareness level that it's coming. And we're getting better. Our clients are getting better at the use of mobile. And I think as we get better, in the future, it's going to garner a greater share of budgets. Going back to the earlier question on travel, it wasn't due to the sector as much as it was due to a specific client loss that we're cycling through.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of William Bird with Lazard.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could just talk about severance and just how you're managing kind of given the uncertainty in the climate, and whether there was a meaningful change in severance year-over-year in the June quarter.","Randall J. Weisenburger","There wasn't a meaningful change. I think it was pretty much flat, maybe up a couple million dollars. Flat, basically flat.","John D. Wren","Yes, to my great disappointment.","Randall J. Weisenburger","We're managing it. We're managing -- we're trying to manage our cost structures, our headcount and staff alignments extremely cautiously. As people know, it's quite expensive to adjust headcounts, especially in Europe. But our agencies are trying to manage as close to their current business levels as possible.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","So just to clarify on a prior question on buybacks. Would you borrow to buy back stock?","John D. Wren","What was the question?","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","So you talked about some of the trade-offs on buybacks and acquisitions and so forth.","John D. Wren","Right.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Would you borrow to buy back more stock?","John D. Wren","As a separate decision? I mean, is it...","Randall J. Weisenburger","We've kind of already done it, Bill. I mean, we've added a $750 million worth of debt at the beginning of the quarter. We came into the year, certainly prior to that, like with most years, saying that we had used all of our free cash flow on the combination of dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The debate, I guess, this year is how does that alignment work between acquisitions and share repurchases and do we have leverage? We talked over the last quarter a little bit about going into, potentially, over the course of the year, utilizing some of that $750 million as additional leverage. Through the 6 months, we've overspent our free cash by about $330 million. We'll see where we end up for the full year, but it will be, obviously, someplace between utilizing all of our free cash and increasing our leverage within that $750-million zone.","John D. Wren","The only thing I would add is the motivation and the timing of borrowing the $750 million had more to do with pricing and the attractiveness of it than for any other reasons. We were going to do it, Randy just said that, whether we borrow the $750 million or not. So I don't know if that's answering your question.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Yes. No, that's helpful. And do you expect to get any lift in your business in the September quarter from the Olympics?","John D. Wren","It's -- it'll be muted, if it is. A lot of work that is done on the Olympics, except for specific travel and entertainment, is work that's already been incurred and is already running. So I think the significant benefit from the Olympics has been -- we've already received a lot of it. The other side of that equation is people who are spending in July and early August tend to flatten out in the third month of the quarter post the Olympics. So I'm not anticipating any great lift as a result of the Olympics in the quarter itself. I don't know if Randy has a different view.","Randall J. Weisenburger","No. I mean, I mentioned that I think we got some left in the second quarter from the Olympics. I could see in some of our event businesses, where I know they do quite a bit in the Olympics, it was maybe $10 million or $15 million of revenue in the quarter. As John points out, I think most of the work associated with the Olympics has certainly already been done. And I don't know that there's a huge increase in spending in aggregate across marketing disciplines just because it's an Olympic year. I certainly think people focus on the Olympics as a marketing theme. But if their overall spending increases dramatically, that one's harder to predict.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","At the risk of beating this topic to death, I want to go back to the results by industry. And I think one thing that's intriguing to us here is the really wide gap across the different -- performance gap across the different sectors here. And going back to second quarter of 2011, I don't think you guys provided this breakout of growth by sector, so it's difficult for us to look at kind of year-on-year comps to see if there are any particular events driving this. So given the fact that other is such a substantial -- it's 1\/5 of your revenues, and we saw a pretty substantial deceleration there quarter-on-quarter, and then we see what's happened in telecom, and I think James mentioned T&E, can you give us any more color -- do you have any more color as to whether this is a different type of world situation you're seeing here? And finally, is this organic growth? Just to remind us -- I should know this -- is this organic or is this total reported and, therefore, subject to FX issues?","Randall J. Weisenburger","The numbers here are total reported growth. Yes, I always caveat these numbers, because, frankly, it's difficult for us to have them be meaningful as well. We're dealing with year-over-year changes that include new business wins and losses as well as the underlying industry spend, and it's quarter-on-quarter, which, if a company or a client moves, then, from one quarter to another quarter, it can make a difference in these numbers when you're cutting up our totals into industry sectors, which are relatively small numbers. So relatively small changes can make a change in these year-over-year growth rates. As well as John pointed out in the T&E area, it's a client loss that can move the needle. They just haven't cycled on. So I don't personally put a lot of emphasis on thinking that this gives us an analysis to what's going on in the economies.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Or no growing concern that a category such as Other sees a deceleration and it's such a sizable piece of the business, it's not any bit of a forecasting tool for you in any way?","John D. Wren","No.","Randall J. Weisenburger","No, not at all.","John D. Wren","I mean, we'll -- we look at it, but you're looking for over a much broader period of time than simply a quarter. I mean, 1% of growth is only $30 million for the entire corporation in a quarter. So once you start to break it down into these segments, the numbers, as Randy mentioned, get pretty small.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Last quick one. Could you offer any comments on the PR business? Are you feeling comfortable with the assets there? And is there kind of any onetime events that are impacting the trajectory of growth there?","John D. Wren","Very comfortable with our PR assets. I don't know how well you know me. I'm very comfortable and never satisfied. So there's always more to do. We have great brands, and we have a couple of things which we could improve on. But the direction in the management teams, the products, I'm very comfortable with.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","A couple more follow-ups on the quarter and one on the outlook, please. Could you explain in the U.S. why your Q2 organic growth accelerated versus Q1, even on a difficult comp? Was that account wins, or what might have been driving that? Secondly, in Europe, is it possible to estimate or say what the contribution from the football championships was? I heard what you said on the Olympics. Just wondering if the soccer made a difference on your Europe growth in Q2. And lastly, just to make sure I understand, on Q2 margins, the expansion was quite a bit less than it had been in previous periods. Why was that? And just to come back on a previous question, what sort of buffer do you have to get your target for full year in case things get materially worse on the top line in the second half?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Wow, a lot of questions. So the U.S., obviously, it's our business performance not the underlying economy. I don't think in the second quarter the underlying U.S. economy improved in any meaningful way, maybe even -- it was flat and, certainly, sideways to down.","John D. Wren","The only thing I would add to that, and I'll -- so I mean, do Huntley-Brinkley here, is some of the wins last year, which are cycling in now, have an impact on that. Plus, there's an increasing trend on the part of clients to reduce the number of suppliers, vendors, advertising companies that they deal with, and oft times, we become the beneficiary of that.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes, that's certainly the case. I also was going to say, I think our strategy around new technologies and, basically, making sure that we're building those capabilities and insights into all of our agency platforms is becoming, evidently, the right strategy. I think we're seeing good results across a lot of our agencies because of that. As far as the -- you had a question about benefits of the World Cup in Europe, I don't know. I mean, I -- it wasn't something that stood out in the aggregate. I'm sure some of our agencies benefited because of that. But how much, I don't know.","John D. Wren","And I'd have to admit, out of all the concerns we've had in Europe, I wasn't looking at positives. I was looking at potential downside. So we didn't focus on it. So we don't know the answer to that.","Randall J. Weisenburger","And margins, we're very comfortable with being able to achieve our margin objectives for the full year. With the first quarter, we were a little bit ahead. This quarter, we managed our margin to make sure we were right on track. We are very confident that we're going to be able to achieve the number for the full year. And now, given that we're right on track through 6 months, it means we have more flexibility of making sure we're going to achieve that number in the second half. It's not that it's not without a challenge. Certainly, our agencies have to focus every day on controlling their costs and managing their margins to keep that flexibility in place. But incentive compensation is the primary flex point at this point, and I think we're in good shape or good position.","Operator","And that last question, then, comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","John, you mentioned in your opening comments how you're still early days in learning how to use mobile and social to benefit your clients, and I know it's always a little difficult to parse integrated work. But maybe at the highest level possible, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on now the economics to your agencies may change as you do more earned and owned media work for your clients, particularly around social and mobile platforms and where there is no media company on the end usually to buy the impressions of and, again, how that changes economics for your agencies.","John D. Wren","Sure. If there is a formula, I don't possess it. Not yet. There's a lot of learning that goes on, which means that you're making investments as people learn and practice in these areas to find out what's effective and what isn't effective. Longer term, I think we will get a greater correlation between ROI and the effectiveness of some of these new capabilities, but it's still early days. And most mobile phone advertising up until now has taken a form of banner ads or not truly integrated into the social fabric of what the product is. I see that changing very, very rapidly. And our ability to use phones to motivate, especially at the point of sale, what a consumer would do is also increasing every day as we speak. So it's early days. I've highlighted it. I start most of my CEO meetings by saying mobile first, even though the budgets and the here-and-now spending hasn't yet shifted into these areas. And social is an experiment at the moment in that there's a lot of impact, there's a lot of chatter, and I don't think there's great science behind motivating the discussion of it and tying that directly to the purchase of an individual product. But that'll increase as time goes on. So it's early days, and I don't have the answer.","Randall J. Weisenburger","If our people are innovative, which they are, I think we have the innovative people in the industry globally, these new communications platforms provide us opportunities to create enhanced services for our clients. That's going to create opportunities for revenue enhancement across our agency platforms. So this is all exciting opportunities for us, and we're at the very beginning of it.","John D. Wren","And just one more final point on it. As a generalization, complexity is good for our business, because our clients require us to be able to help them simplify and direct their spending. So in the aggregate, all of these new opportunities are just that, opportunities for us.","Randall J. Weisenburger","So with that, I think we'll thank everyone for taking the time to listen to our call. Hopefully we answered most everyone's questions, and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive TeleConference Service.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce today's conference call host, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Omnicom Group, Mr. Randall Weisenburger. Please go ahead.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our second quarter 2013 earnings call. We hope everyone had a chance to review our earnings release. We have posted to our website both the press release and the presentation covering the information that we'll be presenting this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I have been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that's included at the end of our investor presentation and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and that these statements are our present expectations, and that actual events or results may differ materially.","I'd also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we'll discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.","We're going to begin the call with some brief remarks from John Wren. Following John's remarks, we'll review our financial performance for the quarter, and then both John and I will be happy to take questions.","John D. Wren","Good morning. Thank you for joining us on the call. We're now half way through 2013, and I'm pleased to say that our performance continues to demonstrate the strength, diversity and stability of our business.","On a global basis, our top and bottom line was consistent with our internal forecast. And as you can see in our deck, organic growth was 2.8%, and margins increased during the quarter.","Regionally, our performance broadly reflected the different macroeconomic conditions in global markets. Our business in the United States continues to grow at a steady pace that is slightly faster than the overall economy. In Asia and Latin America, we're experiencing stronger growth. And as you might expect, the Eurozone remains a key geographic challenge.","Before discussing the highlights of our second quarter performance, let me start by providing an update on the progress we're making on our key strategic initiatives. More than at any time in our history, our company and agencies are aligned around the common set of strategies that are essential to our growth. These strategies share a goal of helping us meet the rapidly changing needs of our clients by giving them access to the best people and the latest technologies, where and when they need it: first is attracting, retaining and developing top talent; next is expanding our global footprint and moving into new service areas; third is building upon our digital and analytical capabilities by investing in our agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies in key markets around the world; and finally, by delivering innovative solutions using meaningful consumer insights across systems and platforms for the benefit of our clients.","Our progress is really a reflection of the caliber and contributions of our people. I'm happy to report our agencies continue the tradition of creativity and innovation with a record year at Cannes. Omnicom won more than 240 Lions across all marketing disciplines, categories and geographies.","Let me just mention a few of the highlights. BBDO and DDB were 2 of the top 3 networks for the seventh consecutive year. Omnicom Media Group earned the most wins of any media agency holding company in the media category for the second year in a row, and OMD Australia was Media Agency of the Year. Ketchum was the only public relations firm to win Lions across multiple categories. And finally, demonstrating our breadth and depth, Omnicom agencies from more than 35 countries, representing 145 brands, won Lions. It's also worth noting that many of our winning Cannes entries were the result of multiple Omnicom agencies working together on behalf of our biggest accounts. This reflects an important trend in our industry, as many clients are telling us that they want greater collaboration, cooperation and efficiencies around the world.","On the digital front, we're also benefiting from stronger capabilities that blur the lines between disciplines and geographies. We continue to see a proliferation of new platforms and an increasing desire from our clients to create effective campaigns that work across all media channels, technologies and devices. As I've said before, the way to succeed in this environment is to develop digital skill sets at every agency and partner with the right technology leaders. This allows us, without bias or silos, to develop and integrate the most effective digital strategies.","For example, at Annalect, our primary data and analytical business, we have incredible talent that is developing innovative partnerships and leveraging cutting-edge technologies and tools to collect data in real time and convert it into actionable insights. Accuen, which already operates in the United States, Europe and Asia, is extending its programmatic ad-buying system into Latin America to service the growing needs of our clients in that region. Last month, Annalect also announced a global deal with salesforce.com that will allow us to use the Salesforce marketing cloud to build a suite of social tools. This partnership will support social media offerings across all Omnicom agencies that allow them to deliver more dynamic, real-time content.","This is just one of many examples of our open-source approach to partnering with media, data and research companies. This strategy allows us to employ the latest technologies, and at the same time, reduce our investment in technologies that may become outdated.","Now let me turn to our second quarter results. As I mentioned, organic growth globally was up 2.8%. Revenue growth in the quarter was well balanced between the U.S. at 2.7%, and the international markets at 2.8%. With the exception of the euro markets, all of our regions experienced solid growth. Randy will provide more details when he makes his remarks. As a result of our top line performance and focus on expense management, we continue to drive strong cash flow. Our balance sheet remains extremely sound, giving us the flexibility to utilize our free cash flow in a disciplined manner for dividends, prudent acquisitions and share repurchases.","Overall, Omnicom's performance this quarter reflects our commitment to delivering the highest quality work for our clients, expanding our capabilities to continue to effectively market across the globe in a digital world and building strong agency cultures.","I will now turn the call back to Randy, who will take you through the numbers in more detail.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Thank you, John. As John said, our agencies had an excellent performance in Q2, benefiting from their continuous focus on delivering new, innovative and insightful ideas and services to their clients, while relentlessly driving their own cost efficiencies.","As a result, revenue came in right on track at $3.6 billion, and our EBITA margin for the quarter increased almost 20 basis points to 15.1%, bringing EBITA for the quarter up to $548 million. Operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased 3.3% to $523 million, and the resulting operating margin was 14.4%, also a year-over-year improvement of about 20 basis points.","Looking at the items below operating income, net interest expense for the quarter was $40.7 million, up $5.8 million from Q2 of last year and just about flat with the first quarter. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to the interest cost on the $1.25 billion of 10-year notes we issued last year. If you remember, the first tranche of $750 million was issued early in Q2, and the second tranche of $500 million was issued mid-Q3. Together, they have a blended interest rate of about 3.4%.","On the tax front, our reported rate for the quarter was 33.9%. While the rate was down slightly from last year, there were a few ups and downs in the quarter from discrete items that pushed the rate up just a bit. For the full year, we still expect our operating tax rate to be around 33.6%, which is about where we are for the first 6 months.","Net income for the quarter was $289.5 million, which was a solid increase of 2.4%. And on Slide 3, we show the computation of diluted EPS. The increase in net income, combined with the year-over-year reduction in our diluted share count of 4.6%, resulted in EPS for the quarter of $1.09, which was an increase of 6.9%.","On Slide 4, we take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX, on a year-over-year basis, the U.S. dollar strengthened against most of our major currencies, except for the euro and the Chinese yuan. The net result reduced revenue in the quarter by $18.7 million or about 0.6%. Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are currently, we expect FX to be negative by about 1% in Q3 and about 1.5% in Q4. Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by $4.3 million. And in the quarter, we completed the sale of our recruitment marketing business, so for the next few quarters, absent new acquisitions, we could have negative acquisition revenue of between 70 and 100 basis points.","With regard to organic growth, we had another very solid quarter, up 2.8% or $99 million. As we've talked about before, this quarter, we were up against strong comparables, including specific Olympic-related revenue of about $50 million.","A couple other areas worth mentioning this quarter. We continue to have excellent performance from our media operations, driven by both solid new business activities and new services. Our specialty pharma and health care businesses are benefiting from a combination of recent wins and increased activity from clients. And our agencies in many of the emerging markets, China, Russia, India, the U.A.E., Turkey, Colombia and Chile, to name a few, continue to have strong double-digit growth.","Turning to our mix of revenue by discipline on Slide 5. Brand advertising accounted for 48% of our revenue; and marketing services, 52%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising's organic growth was 4.3%, driven by strong growth in our media businesses, as well as good new business performance in the second half of last year. However, this was offset to some extent by recent moves of Gillette and Chevy. And our marketing services was up 1.4% in aggregate. Within marketing services, CRM was down 0.5%, primarily driven by declines in our sports and events businesses when compared to the second quarter of last year, when they had the benefit of significant Olympics-related revenues. Our public relations businesses continue to have very good results, posting organic growth of 3.8%. And specialty communications had an outstanding quarter, up 7.8%, predominantly driven by strong results across the board from our specialty health care businesses.","On Slide 6 and 7, our geographic mix of business in the quarter was split 52% domestic and 48% international. In the United States, revenue increased $44.4 million or 2.4%. Organic growth continue to be very solid, up 2.7%, and acquisitions net of dispositions was down $6.7 million or 0.3%. International revenue increased $32 million or about 1.9%. FX created a headwind, causing revenue to decline $19 million. Acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue $2.4 million, and organic growth, which continues to be very mixed by region, increased this quarter to 2.8% or $48 million.","In Europe, of the larger countries, Russia and the U.K. continue to perform very well, while Germany and France were down. In the U.K., increased spending by our consumer products and telecom clients led our traditional agencies, especially our media agencies, to a solid quarter. The Eurozone markets, in aggregate, were down 3% organically.","And in Asia, we had strong performances across most of the region, with double-digit growth in China, India, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.","And in Latin America, we continue to have standout results in Brazil, Chile and Colombia.","Slide 8 shows our mix of business by industry. As the chart shows, we had strong performances in the quarter in the travel and entertainment sector, which was primarily driven by a couple of recent new business wins, as well as the consumer products, telecom and pharma sectors, which resulted from a balance of new business wins and increased spending. Obviously, we were down in the auto sector, primarily due to the Chevy move.","Turning to Slide 9. Our cash performance for the first 6 months of the year was on track and consistent with last year. We generated just over $700 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital.","On Slide 10, the breakdown of our primary uses of cash over the same 6 months included dividends to our common shareholders of about $107 million. The year-over-year decrease reflects the fact that we accelerated our normal January dividend payment to December of last year. Dividends paid to minority interest shareholders of $60 million and capital expenditures of $69 million. CapEx this year is down year-over-year, primarily due to a couple of sizable office moves and a long-term lease renewal that occurred last year that had significant build-outs involved. Acquisitions including earn-out payments, net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $45 million. And share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $492 million. All in, we overspent our free cash flow by about $71 million for the 6 months.","Slide 11 shows our current capital structure. As we believe everyone's aware, we redeemed $407 million of our convertible notes during the second quarter for a combination of cash and stock. That reduced the amount of convertible notes outstanding down to $253 million. And that, coupled with the second tranche of senior notes issued in Q3 of 2012, brings our total debt balance up to just over $4 billion. Also, year-over-year, our net debt position increased by $377 million to $2.63 billion, primarily as a result of share buybacks over the past 12 months. As a result of the increased debt, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.9x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is only 1.2x. Our interest coverage ratio, at 10.8x, remains very strong.","On Slide 12, we show our ROIC and our ROE metrics, both of which continue to be very strong. Our return on invested capital for the trailing 12-month period increased to 17.5%, and our return on equity for the same period increased to almost 32%.","And finally on Slide 13, which tracks the total cash payout to shareholders, shows that since 2002, we've returned just over 100% of our net income to shareholders through the combination of dividends and share repurchases.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. There are several other supplemental slides included in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, I'm going to ask the operator to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of James Dix with Wedbush.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just 3 things. I guess, when you look at the growth within the advertising discipline, are there any longer-term trends you think worth pointing out in terms of organic growth, and I guess also, margin trends between your media agencies as opposed to the other agencies within that category? Just curious on that. And then secondly, just your thoughts on what the amount of pending large pitches is in the market at the moment, and in particular, what's your outlook for picking up some auto business to take advantage of your resources there. And then finally, there's a couple -- there's been some trade press on some renewed push by procurement, which I assume is ever present, or changes in some types of payment terms, in particular, how quickly they will be paying for certain types of services. Just wondering how we should be thinking about developments there. Is there anything really new there? And is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of modeling cash flow going forward?","Randall J. Weisenburger","That was long enough, I forgot the first question.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I've got them written down, Randy, so...","Randall J. Weisenburger","I'm kidding. I'll let John go.","John D. Wren","Let's start from the bottom up. In terms of procurement, there's always been pressure, there continues to be pressure to drive efficiencies. With respect to balance sheet cash flow, we've turned down and not accepted clients that we could have won because we weren't prepared to accept the terms that they were offering. We're not a bank. I think if you speak to my competitors, they'll both -- or all 3 agree with that concept. That's not what we're here for. And anybody who wants to treat us like a bank can go to a bank. The second thing, part, pending large pitches, there's a couple around. We don't try to aggregate them. We just believe in ourselves, and we believe that if we get up to the plate, we'll score well. There's no -- not to my knowledge -- big car pitches up at the moment, but I have great confidence in the capabilities of the people who were on the Chevy business, that when one does come up, we'll have a very good chance at it. And then your first question...","Randall J. Weisenburger","And on the car front, we have a excellent roster of auto clients already, 3 major global accounts, so it's not like we're short of auto.","John D. Wren","But we always accept the next one if we can handle it. And then in terms of your first question, which was the distinction in margins between the media agencies and the advertising disciplines, I think?","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes.","John D. Wren","They're roughly the same. I'll let Randy...","Randall J. Weisenburger","The media agencies have strong margins. There's a lot -- there's more investment in the systems and technology, especially with some of the new areas of programmatic trading and I'll say digital marketing, behavioral marketing. So I think we get a pretty comparable return on capital in both areas. Yes, that's probably all there is to really say about it. On an absolute reported margin basis, the media business are a little bit higher. You also asked about growth in advertising, the strong growth in advertising. The way we operate the business, I think a lot of that is being driven by digital, or what other people might break out as digital. We operate our businesses on a much more integrated basis, and we're certainly seeing strong growth with providing services to utilize new technologies.","Operator","Our next question would come from the line of John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Randy, there's been some concern in the market that the tone of business in the emerging markets slowed a bit in both Asia and Latin America. I know you spoke to it briefly, but did you see any sign of that trend in China, India or Brazil as you exited the quarter or at the start of the third quarter?","Randall J. Weisenburger","China and India were very strong for us. Brazil is not growing as fast as China and India right now. Brazil is a much more developed market in many ways.","John D. Wren","But there are -- the balance of this year, who knows, next year, you start with a lot of major global events that will run through 2016, so we're very bullish about Brazil in the near term.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then separately, you had accelerating growth in the U.K. in a period where you mentioned the Olympics comp. And the European, I guess, money looks like it stabilized. Are you guys feeling a little bit more comfortable about the region going forward?","John D. Wren","Well, the U.K. was benefited a little bit by switching a packaged goods company, which we were handling out of our French office last year at this time. And we switched to our London office. That, plus the Olympics. So France wasn't as down as much as the reported numbers would have you believe. And the U.K., which was very strong, was still very strong, but not as strong as the reported numbers. Southern -- Spain and Southern Europe seems to be bottoming out. I think you still have concerns, and we still have some concerns in the very short term about France and Germany until after the election, but nothing dramatic. It's just -- it's a bit of a headwind.","Randall J. Weisenburger","It does feel like it's stabilizing. It's not -- it's just not necessarily rebounding yet, but one step at a time.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","A few questions, one at a time, if I could. Typically, you'll give us what your net billings number was in the quarter. I think your goal was generally about $1 billion per quarter. What was it this last quarter, please?","Randall J. Weisenburger","We were right about $800 million with the -- with Chevy and a couple other things, like Gillette. As I've always said, if -- a couple big moves, big changes up or down can affect the quarter, so I think our base was very strong, came in pretty much as we would expect, but with the Gillette loss, it just pushed us down below $1 billion.","Craig Huber","Okay. Then switching over to the U.K., just a little bit further on this, if we could, Randy or John. The 7.4% organic number there, how much was that impacted on a year-over-year basis organically from the Olympics revenue about a year ago? And also, can you just talk a little bit further about this switch of the business booked in France over to London. That just basically started at the beginning of the second quarter. It's the first time I've heard you talk about it.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think the Olympics was around $15 million to $20 million in the U.K. I don't have the number at my fingertips, but I think it's in that category.","John D. Wren","And I've seen the number for the second quarter of that move, but I don't have it sitting in front of me. But it was just we changed personnel and where the lead on that global piece of business was from, at the clients' request, and so it was neutral to the overall Omnicom. But if you're examining microscopically the countries, it had an impact on -- to the benefit of the U.K. and to the detriment of France.","Randall J. Weisenburger","We've talked about these things a few times. There's a handful of places in the world that are really global centers that you can really handle global pieces of business out of. I think last year or maybe it was the year before, we had it where a piece of business moved from the Netherlands to the United States. And when you deal in some of those international markets on these global pieces of business, when you have a move, either in or out, it can look pretty impactful in that market. If it happens to go into a place like the United States, it tends to get blended away a little bit because it's just the size of the market. But as John points out, it's net neutral for overall Omnicom revenues. It just makes these country numbers look different than what the actual market economy is. Many times, I think when we talk about revenue growth in a country, people take that as to the strength of the country or the strength of the market in that country, and that's certainly one aspect of it. But wins and losses are, at times, an overwhelming aspect of it, especially as we get to the smaller markets.","Craig Huber","But just -- I'm sorry, just for the timing of this switch between the countries, that basically started at the beginning of this second quarter?","John D. Wren","I don't know if it was late in the first quarter, and just probably we didn't have an impact.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes, I think...","John D. Wren","When I spoke of it in the last call.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think the move started in the first quarter, but again, it takes a little while to move a sizable piece of business.","Craig Huber","And then my final question, please. When you think about your Southeast Asian markets, China and maybe Australia, is the rate of growth in those markets for Omnicom -- is the rate of growth slowing there, given the economic slowness we hearing over there?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I don't think China is. Australia probably is. Last year, we benefited -- we finally consolidated Clemenger. And with that, quite a bit of activity was going on around it, where we were able to expand the business, probably a little bit faster than normal, so that's steady. But China still remains a very strong double-digit growth market.","Craig Huber","And you're not seeing it slow at all, in a material level?","John D. Wren","Not for our business, no.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Townsend Buckles - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Townsend Buckles for Alexia. Can you say how much of an impact the recent account losses had on the quarter, specifically Chevy and Gillette, as you called out, and what we should expect in coming quarters?","Randall J. Weisenburger","No, that's not something that we really break out client by client.","Townsend Buckles - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I guess, as we look at the U.S. growth, it slowed a bit from Q1. I mean, would you say that most of that would reflect those losses, if you can say?","Randall J. Weisenburger","The problem with the question is, if I -- I can take any bad thing or I can take any good thing and probably account a quarter to any one of them, but there's 100 of them every quarter. So it's -- to try to isolate and say that the quarter is down because of a Gillette -- the Gillette move or I can also say it was up because of this move. This stuff balances out. So we don't really look at it quite that way, we prefer to never have any account losses. We prefer to only have account wins, but unfortunately, both happens.","Townsend Buckles - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And your sale of Hodes, I think that's been a bit of a drag on the business in the past. Should we expect this to have a positive impact on organic growth and profitability going forward? Will that be meaningful at all?","Randall J. Weisenburger","It will definitely be positive on organic growth and margins going forward. It's got -- 3 years ago, it had a bigger impact. But right now, the impact because of the business, while it was not positive, was starting -- was stabilizing at a very low number. So it was -- the benefits of losing this headwind on organic growth, again, will be positive but not significantly positive. And kind of the same thing with margins, it will be positive but not noticeably.","John D. Wren","Right. I mean, if you recall, we didn't call it out specifically, but implied in what we said in 2010 of the agencies that we felt were no longer strategic to the business, and we wanted to, in an orderly fashion, dispose of them. Hodes was probably the largest of the remaining items on that list, and it just took us until now to dispose of it in an orderly fashion.","Townsend Buckles - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then just lastly, if you can talk just generally about how you're seeing the second half of the year in terms of client sentiment and spending plans?","John D. Wren","Right now, we're in the process of re-forecasting for the second half, and we're not quite done with that process, but we haven't seen any major swift swings in attitude from what we previously had forecasted.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes. And we're certainly comfortable with what we've been talking about if you go on along. I mean, this quarter, the margins were up. Our agencies have done an extremely good job of pressing their own efficiencies. So I think we're certainly more comfortable with the full year than we were -- well, I mean, I guess, we've always been comfortable with it, but it's certainly encouraging to see how this quarter came out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of William Bird with Lazard.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Yes, as a follow-up, just as you look at kind of the second half and you think about kind of how some of your leading clients are behaving, would you expect kind of the growth profile to be consistent with the first half or somewhat different?","Randall J. Weisenburger","We have -- we've got a little bit less headwind in the -- certainly at least in the third quarter. We've had, as we've talked about a couple times, some specific Olympic revenue in the first half as a headwind. We're not going to have that in the second half. And I think all the client conversations that I've heard remain pretty consistent with what we thought at the beginning of the year. So at this point, I think we think we feel pretty positive about the year.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And as you alluded to earlier, there's some natural chop in the business from quarter-to-quarter. Is there anything to read into the moderation in U.S. growth in Q2?","John D. Wren","I don't think so.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And finally, can you talk a bit about just your strategy around programmatic buying and Accuen?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I'm going to let John do that. I want to go back to your other point about the U.S. I mentioned the Olympics spending. The Olympics happened to be in London. All the work that we did wasn't in London, so a piece of it was there, but frankly, more -- much more of it was in the United States.","John D. Wren","Digital buying of media is done by machines as if you're standing on the floor of the NASDAQ as opposed to in a traditional media shop. Increasingly, the capabilities of what we can do, we -- I hold the long-term belief that, eventually, traditional media or a lot of traditional media will get purchased that way. So where we have a client need, we've been expanding the service and opening up the capability country -- major country by major country. And it improves every day because with more volume, more activity, it just expands, and it can probably continue to expand for the foreseeable future in terms of what it can do.","Randall J. Weisenburger","And the labor in that space is really in developing the technology and developing the insights. So as of right now, while the buying uses a lot more technology, the development of that technology, the programming and insights that we give from one client to the next is still obviously very labor intensive.","John D. Wren","And as you can imagine, the publishers are changing their algorithms constantly, so we're changing our algorithms constantly.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And just a final question. Based on the numbers you gave, Randy, just on the acquisition headwind from the Hodes sale, is it roughly a $100 million business and annualized? And I'm just curious what the organic growth was on that business.","Randall J. Weisenburger","That's -- you got the number about right, about $100 million, and it was costing us $2 million to $5 million a quarter in negative organic growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have one for Randy and one for John. Randy, just looking at this -- the auto number being down 11%, and I know a lot of that is owing to the Chevy move, and maybe you can't quantify the exact impact of that. But I just wanted to hear if there's anything organic going on in automotive. We heard that in the TV upfront that some of the tone of business was maybe slightly slower, so I just wanted to hear if there's anything that we can isolate at auto. And then the second question for John, I appreciate your comment about growing your digital capabilities at your agencies. I'm always trying to figure out, there are these independent ad technology firms that pop up and that have material or legitimate businesses and business models. And did you think that the digital capabilities at your agencies are taking share from the independents or not? And so I just also want to ask that question in the context of your need to build digital via acquisition as digital matures. I guess the hope would be that more of your growth is organic as digital matures and the need for those bolt-on acquisitions actually sort of diminishes.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Sure. I may take a stab at both of them, and John can correct me on the second one. So in auto, our major auto clients are doing quite well. I think the bulk of the change this quarter really was the Chevy move. But we have a lot of different auto businesses. Our 3 major accounts are doing quite well. And the rest of it is probably -- if there's anything else, it's probably project business. On the media technology front, there's a very interesting ecosystem that's being developed, where there are a number of companies that are being established to hopefully sort of knock down roadblocks in the development of the space. As the space evolves, issues pop up, and people try to attack those issues. Many of those technologies, the better ones we're partnering with, we're maybe even buying some of their services. I think that will continue to go on for quite some time, because frankly, as the space evolves, more and more little roadblocks pop up as people move forward. Our people are obviously also developing solutions around those issues, and we're happy to find the best answer for our clients. And it's inevitably going to be a combination of utilizing solutions developed by third parties, developing some of our own solutions and there will inevitably be some places, at least as of right now, that haven't appeared yet, that we're going to find solutions necessary to keep moving forward.","John D. Wren","And the only thing I would add to that is with all the digital channels that are now available to reach the desired audiences, clients understand the complexity, and they're actually looking for partners that can holistically handle both their digital requirements and their traditional requirements. And whilst small, very successful startups, when you compare them to the size of a company like Omnicom, may win $20 million, which may turn to be 10% growth for them, that's not much of a challenge to us. And we think the long-term trend is clients looking for people they can depend on to provide insights and to reach those audiences holistically.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Two questions, please. First, nice to see a bit of margin expansion in the quarter after you hadn't really promised any necessarily this year. I just wonder if there's any updated thoughts on what we could expect for margins, particularly having seen you attain your margin target last year. And then secondly, it might be a little bit philosophical, but seeing that the moderation in economies in emerging markets, I'm wondering if you can gauge whether emerging market ad spending might follow the typical cyclical patterns that we see in the U.S. and Europe, or if by contrast, and I get the sense this is what's happening, at least in China, just the structural growth in consumer spending means there just remains strong demand for your services.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I'll say...","John D. Wren","Yes. I should've written down the question, sorry.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Well, in -- on margins, we had a really good quarter. Our agencies are making great progress and are very focused on finding internal efficiencies. I don't think, at this point, we're making promises on margins any different than we said before, but we're very happy with the work that's been done in the quarter and are going to continue to put all the focus we can on finding every efficiency possible.","John D. Wren","The only thing I might add to that is, as we look to the third and the fourth quarter, we're not internally forecasting margin improvement, but we're not -- when you compare just those quarters, but we're not forecasting that they'll be down. So the gains we've had in the first 6 months will flow through. And your second philosophical question?","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Should I repeat the second one? Maybe I shouldn't have said philosophical. It's a scary word. It's just understanding kind of the cyclical versus the structural growth trends in emerging markets. So whether we get moderation in economies in China, Brazil, India, whatever the countries may be, does that lead to moderation in ad spending, as we typically see in the U.S. and Europe? Or by contrast, is there just enough strong structural growth and consumer spending growth in these markets that your business could remain just fine?","John D. Wren","If you -- I think in our situation, it's slightly different. In the United States, we're very large, so we are impacted by GDP and track it. In some of those other markets, we don't have as much market share, and we still have the opportunity to get -- gain new clients, as well as be impacted by their economic situation. So we haven't tried to drill down and understand every nuance about the difference between 7.5% and 8.5% growth in China because, for instance, we still have the opportunity to win new business. So philosophically, we haven't spent the energy just trying to gauge that impact because we haven't reached 100% market share yet.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Our client -- depends on the market as well, but our client base, I think, at this point, is largely focused on getting themselves more and more entrenched and established in those markets. So I would think that their spending patterns won't exactly follow the economy, which is good for us. It basically is saying that the structural growth kind of outweighs the cyclical growth.","John D. Wren","Yes.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Or cyclical patterns.","John D. Wren","And I've never said this before, but I'm sure one of my competitors is prepared to tell the Chinese what their growth will be for the next year, so you might ask the question of them.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think we have one -- time for one more question.","Operator","And that will be from the line of Matt Chesler with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you're more comfortable with the full year but are still reviewing the plan. You spoke a little bit about how you're coming in slightly ahead year-to-date on the margins. What's your level of comfort and increased confidence in terms of the top line momentum? Or is it really just the conversion of that into profitability?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think we had the toughest headwinds in the first half of the year, so if I go through and if we're right about those headwinds and that they just disappear, and it wasn't shift -- money shifted around, I think we feel pretty good with where we're at through the first 6 months. So that gives us more confidence in the numbers that we were talking about for the full year.","John D. Wren","But you know just from following us, we're constantly doing bottoms up and then looking at what we're doing. So whilst confident, we're not ones to overpromise at this point.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I definitely appreciate that. We still have a half of year to go. I'm just trying to understand, I mean, things seem to be certainly on track through this first 6 months, and some of the parts of the business are de-risked, and you're executing well. Just trying to understand what you think the risks are through the back half of the year and what could prevent a situation where we're not sitting here in January and you're telling us that you came in slightly ahead of what your formal plan had been?","Randall J. Weisenburger","There's always the fairly big number every year in Q4 -- at the very end of Q4. It's very difficult for us to predict if it -- if that spending pattern follows, I'll say, historic patterns, then we're going to be in -- we're going to have a very -- we're going to have a good year. We're going to certainly be able to achieve our targets and all the numbers that we've talked about. But it always makes us nervous, because frankly, those numbers don't start to solidify until late in the fourth quarter. So could that -- could something affect that? Sure, it could. We don't expect it will, because frankly, the historic patterns are fairly consistent, but it's difficult to forecast.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. You also had mentioned the strong performance of your specialty health care practice. Is that -- how much of that is related to agency performance as opposed to -- I'm just trying to get color on whether you think that, broadly speaking, health care marketing has reached the point where you're seeing overall growth industry-wide at this point.","John D. Wren","Well, I mean, we have had some new business wins. I think when you get outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, I think there's a lot of potential growth for health care and health care spending, especially as people move up into the middle class or what they call the middle class. The limitation on our side will be, can we find the talent and train people to take that business, not whether it's healthier. It's not healthier. I believe it's very healthy, and it's an opportunity if we can execute against it in the correct marketplace.","Randall J. Weisenburger","We also won some very good pieces of new business last year, some pitches that were out there. And the revenue didn't really come through. The spending didn't come through to drive it. I think we're starting to see some of that now. Looking at some of our peers' numbers, they are mentioning that health care is strong for them as well. I'm not sure if it's as strong as ours or not. I haven't compared the relative numbers, but they're talking about health care positively. So I would guess, hearing that market commentary, that the health care category is picking up in spending, which makes some sense when I tie together some of the wins we had last year and the numbers sort of not showing up then but they're showing up now and the overall backdrop. So it has traditionally been a very good space. It seems like we're back on that track.","Thank you all for taking the time to listen to our call. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to know introduce you to today's conference call host, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Omnicom Group, Mr. Randall Weisenburger. Please go ahead.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. We hope everyone's had a chance to review our earnings release. We've posted to our website both the press release and a presentation covering the information that we'll be presenting this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","But before we start, I've been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that's included in the back of our investor presentation, and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectations, and actual events or results may differ materially.","I'd also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.","We're going to begin the call with some brief remarks from John Wren. Following John's remarks, we'll review the financial performance for the quarter in more detail, and then both John and I will be happy to take questions.","John D. Wren","Good morning. I'm pleased to speak to you this morning about our latest business results, the progress we're making and my thoughts for the rest of the year.","2012 is off to a very good start. First quarter results were strong. Revenues exceeded our internal forecast, and we posted significant improvement in our operating margins. Looking at the balance of the year, we're cautiously optimistic on revenue. The region most at risk is Europe. Major economies outside Europe, I'm happy to say, seem to be improving at a steady pace. ","From the cost side, our determination to contain costs and drive operating efficiencies is working, and we are on track to achieve our margin objectives for 2012.","Given an improving but fragile global economy, we at Omnicom are focused on the things we can control. We are continuing to make significant investments in people to broaden our capabilities and service offerings. We're also pursuing, as you know, a multi-pronged digital strategy built around the core idea that all of our agencies must have a strong digital talent and capabilities in order to compete in the future. ","As a result, we are helping and pushing our agencies where needed in order to accelerate the expansion of their digital expertise. To achieve our objectives, we're employing an open-source technology approach by partnering with technology leaders to ensure that we have access to the latest innovations and information in the marketplace. These partnerships allow us to integrate the most effective digital strategies within our clients' overall marketing plans. Now I'd like to turn my attention to the first quarter.","Organic growth for the first 3 months was a very strong 5.1%. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by very positive results in developing markets, and solid performances in the U.S. and the U.K. This was balanced at the euro markets, which experienced only nominal growth. Our advertising business performed very well, while our PR businesses showed improvement for the first time in several quarters. ","Looking more closely at revenue by geography, we saw a continued strength in the U.S. with organic growth of 4.4%. U.S. growth was driven by strong results in brand advertising, media, and sports and event marketing and was offset by a decline in our healthcare specialty business.","The U.K. experienced organic growth of 4.1%. While the U.K. growth slowed versus the fourth quarter, the market remains relatively favorable despite the broader challenges in Europe and our individual agencies are performing very well. Euro region growth overall was relatively flat, although the performance by market varied. Germany turned in a solid quarter, France was only slightly negative, and the Netherlands underperformed due primarily to the effects of a client loss. ","In the more troubled European markets, Greece and Ireland were negative for the quarter, while the southern European markets had positive growth. ","Outside the euro currency area, Russia and Turkey had very strong performances with double-digit growth. ","In the first quarter we again had strong performances across Asia, particularly Australia, China and Singapore. In Japan, we are happy to say that we had positive organic growth for the first time since the third quarter of 2010. We again experienced growth across almost all of our industry segments. Revenues during the quarter were particularly strong in auto, food and beverage, retail and technology, while only health care had a negative performance. ","During the quarter, our agencies continued to see the benefits of their high-quality work. Net new business for the quarter was over $1 billion, representing a strong start for 2012.","As I mentioned earlier, we experienced solid improvement in our margins. Randy will provide more details on the specifics of our performance later in the call. But I would like to emphasize that at this point, we will achieve our goal of returning full year margins to the level we achieved in 2007.","I'd also like to comment on our overall strategy for allocating our capital. As I noted on the year-end call, our balance sheet remains extremely sound. This gives us the flexibility to make smart investments and reasonably priced acquisitions to further our strategic goals. ","During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Medical Collective Intelligence, MCI, in Japan. MCI provides online and market research to clients in pharmaceutical and medical device industries in the world's second largest pharmaceutical market. And the innovative digital platform offered by MCI has great potential to be rolled out to other markets, especially in Asia. ","Yesterday we also announced the acquisition of NIM Digital, a leading agency in China specializing in media planning and buying, search and digital production services. The addition of NIM will add to our digital capabilities, particularly in search, and will allow us to increase the breadth of our services to our clients. We expect acquisition activity in Asia and other high-growth markets will accelerate over the course of the year.","In addition to our acquisitions, we will continue to utilize our free cash flow for dividends and share repurchases. These distributions are fundamental to our commitment to make shareholders the major beneficiaries of Omnicom's strong cash flow. ","Our performance this quarter reflects our commitment to delivering the highest quality work for our clients around the world, continually expanding our capabilities to effectively market in the digital world and building strong agency cultures. These values are at the core of what we do, and we believe they are the key factors to our success. ","I will now turn the call back to Randy, who will take you through our numbers in more detail.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Thank you, John. Q1 was a great start to the new year. Revenue came in at just over $3.3 billion, with total year-over-year revenue growth of 5% and organic growth continuing well ahead of expectations at 5.1%. I'll address our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes.","EBITA increased 12.7% to $387 million, strong organic revenue growth in the quarter, combined with the benefits of the numerous cost reduction initiatives that our agencies have executed over the past 18 months has resulted in our EBITA margin expanding about 80 basis points to 11.7%. Our objective for the full year is to match our 2007 margin performance, and while this is only one quarter, we are pleased that our Q1 performance was about 30 basis points ahead of that target annualized.","Amortization of intangibles for the quarter increased 16% or $3.3 million year-over-year, but was up only marginally from Q4. Operating income, or EBIT, increased 12.5% to $363 million and resulting operating margin of 11% was a year-over-year improvement of about 80 basis points as well. ","Now turning to Slide 2, and taking a look at the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $29.2 million, down $2.9 million from Q1 of last year and down about $1.1 million from the fourth quarter. The decrease versus Q4 was primarily the result of decreased average borrowings during the first quarter.","On the tax front, our reported rate for the quarter was 32.8%, up from 25.5% in Q1 last year. In both years, our general operating rate was about 34%. Last year, the rate was brought down primarily because the remeasurement gain recorded on the Clemenger deal was nontaxable. And this year, there were a couple of small benefits that reduced the rate for the quarter as well. For the full year, we continue to expect our rate to be between 34% and 34.3%.","Affiliate income in the quarter increased about $1 million, and our minority interest increased by just over $6 million due to a combination of increased earnings in our existing businesses where we owned less than 100%, and a few of our recent acquisitions where we acquired less than 100%. As a result, net income for the quarter increased 1.3% to $204.6 million.","At the top of Slide 3, we show the allocation of net income between our common shares and participating securities or restricted stock. As a result of a year-over-year increase in restricted shares, the allocation of net income to participating securities increased to 4.5 million, leaving net income for common shareholders at just over $200 million for the quarter. Year-over-year, we reduced our outstanding weighted average diluted share count by just over 4%, down to 277.5 million shares. As a result, diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.72.","On Slide 4, we take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX. On a year-over-year basis, the U.S. dollar strengthened against most of our major currencies, including the euro and the pound. While the dollar weakened against the yuan, the yen and the Australian dollar, the net result reduced revenue by $36 million or about 1.1%. Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are, we expect FX to be negative by about 3% in Q2 and by about 1.75% for the full year of 2012.","Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $31 million in the quarter or about 1%. In this quarter, our acquisition revenue was driven by the Clemenger and Communispace acquisitions which we completed in Q1 of 2011, as well as the Mudra, Marina Maher and DDB Turkey acquisitions that we completed in Q4. Also during the first quarter, we continued making investments and completed 3 new acquisitions in Japan, Russia and Australia. Obviously, our acquisition revenue is net of the revenue lost from a number of dispositions we completed over the course of 2011.","If we don't complete another acquisition or disposition, acquisition revenue in the second quarter will be about 0.6%. And with regard to organic growth, we had another very strong quarter and continued to outperform expectations at 5.1% or $161 million. This quarter, organic revenue was driven by a combination of factors. First, very strong new business wins, both this quarter and over the past several quarters. Second, the continued rebound in spending by many of our clients. Third, continued above average growth in the developing markets, in particular, in China, Russia, India and Latin America. And most important, our agencies continuing to expand their capabilities and service offerings to provide innovative marketing solutions for their clients.","Turning to our mix of business on Slide 5, brand advertising accounted for 47% of our revenue, and marketing services 53%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising's organic growth was 8.5%, driven by growth in our media businesses, emerging markets and the continuing rapid growth of our services utilizing digital technologies. In aggregate, margin services was up 2.3% and within this sector, CRM had 3.1% organic growth. This sector was led by strong performances in events, branding and research.","Public relations had a very solid quarter with organic growth rebounding to 4.4%, and specialty communications decreased 3.9%, primarily due to generally lower spending by a number of our leading pharma clients. ","On Slide 6, our geographic mix of business in the quarter was split 52% domestic and 48% international. In the United States, revenue increased $67 million or about 4%. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by $6.5 million and organic growth continued to be strong generally across disciplines and industries coming in at 4.4% or $73 million. International revenue increased $89 million or about 5.9%.","As I said, FX was negative 2.4% or $36 million. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $37.6 million or about 2.5%. And organic growth continued to be very strong at a positive 5.8% or $88 million, although results were still quite mixed by region. ","In Europe, as has been the pattern now for several quarters, results continue to be mixed. Russia continued to perform very well, the U.K. remained steady and Germany had a very solid quarter, while France and the Netherlands were both down. Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain, although relatively small for us, in the aggregate were up about 3%.","In Asia, we had very strong performances in Australia, China, India and Singapore. Japan also had a good quarter, and Korea was flat. We also continued to have very good results in the other emerging markets of Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, with a standout performance for the quarter in Mexico.","Turning to Slide 7, which shows our mix of business by industry, there were no significant changes in the quarter versus Q1 of 2011, or Q4 for that matter. And as you can see from this slide, we had growth in every industry sector except pharma this quarter, with strong growth in autos, retail, travel and entertainment and technology.","Turning to Slide 8, our cash performance in the quarter was in line with our expectations. We generated approximately $311 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. ","On Slide 9, you can see the breakdown of our primary uses of cash during the quarter. They included dividends to our common shareholders of about $70 million, which reflected the 20% increase in our quarterly dividend, dividends paid to minority interest shareholders of $23 million, capital expenditures of $46 million. We should note CapEx this year will likely be up a bit year-over-year due to a couple of real estate moves and an upfront investment to support our initiatives to increase the centralization of our IT infrastructure.","Acquisitions including earnout payments, net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $13 million in the quarter; and share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $153 million. All in, we were basically cash or leverage neutral for the quarter.","Slide 10 shows our current capital structure. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $1.66 billion, a decrease of about $40 million since last year. Our leverage ratio or total debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 1.6x, while our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 1 at 0.8x. And our interest coverage ratio remains very strong and improved in the quarter a full turn to 12.9x. ","And finally on Slide 11, as we continue to successfully build the company through a combination of prudently-priced acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives, both our return on invested capital and return on equity have remained strong. On a rolling 4-quarter basis, for the 4 quarters ended 3\/31\/2012, our return on invested capital improved to 16.9% and our return on equity improved to 26.9%.","So in summary, we believe we're off to a great start for the new year, and we believe we are on track to meet the targets for 2012 that we set out last year. This concludes our prepared remarks. There are, however, several other supplemental slides included in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, I'm going to ask the operator to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","My question is really about margins. I wanted to ask about beyond this year, you've been very clear about your 13.4% target but beyond that, can you give us some sort of thought as to where margins could go? And the second part of the question is your comment toward the end there about some CapEx increases this year and real estate moves and some IT centralization, that is pretty intriguing to me, if you could talk a bit more about that and how that might lead in the cost efficiencies over time.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Okay. I'll do the second part of the question. So periodically, when we have larger office moves, CapEx can spike a little bit because of buildout. So this year, we have a couple of those. BBDO in New York being one and being the largest. It also looks like we're going to acquire an office space in Florida, so that would a little bit of CapEx layout. And then from an IT centralization standpoint, we've been working for a few years now to bring together our data centers by -- at least by network. So a number of those initiatives are being developed this year. So that will have a modest increase in CapEx, maybe to the tune, in aggregate, an increase of $20 million to $30 million.","John D. Wren","To the first part of your question, this is John, margins. We're comfortable in giving a forecast of what our margins are going to be this year. Obviously, we're constantly working on becoming more efficient. We'll continue to do that. But at this point, I don't think we want to lay out our objectives beyond 12\/31\/12.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Could you maybe give us some more numbers behind the real estate and IT? Any indication of what the cost savings for those from those might be?","Randall J. Weisenburger","In the current year, I don't think there will be any. It may actually be an increase in cost because we're going through the transition period of moving IT from existing locations, so we'll continue to have those costs creating the centers, obviously have those costs and we'll end up running those capabilities parallel for some period of time. On an ongoing basis, we think it will enhance our capabilities. We think it will give us more robust systems and a lot of standardization around the network. And hopefully, it will lead to efficiencies as well.","Operator","And our next question will come from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing in Europe now that you're entering the second quarter, specifically in France? Any signs of stability or improvement there? And with regards to the client loss that you highlighted in the Netherlands, do you -- any sense of when you circle that loss?","John D. Wren","I'll do the second part first. The client that we lost in the Netherlands, if nothing else happens, we'll have that loss through the balance of the year. At least through the year. Having said that, we have 2 other agencies which we own bidding for that same work. So if we're lucky and successful and one of them retains the work, it will mitigate that loss. I don't know if it will mitigate it in the Netherlands, but it will mitigate it in the aggregate. I'm sorry, the second part of your question?","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In France, any -- I know it's early in the second quarter, but any sense of stability there, any signs of improvement?","John D. Wren","There's no instability. There's uncertainty, I guess. They're going through their elections now. And so people are distracted on other things and they're distracted by Greece and Spain and implications for the whole EU. So we're not seeing any great setbacks, but we're not seeing any plans for expansion in our conversations.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then the positive swing that you saw, I guess company-wide in PR, any driver behind that, it may be a client win or is that general sort of improvement in that segment?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think it's a combination of general improvement in the segment. We're rebounding but frankly, the business broadly was pretty solid really over the last couple of quarters, and it just kind of wasn't appearing in the numbers. So I don't think it's a big rebound or a big turnaround. Our businesses are in very good shape. They've done a good job with their clients. It's just starting. I guess, it's really just coming back into the numbers.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Then I guess last question just given your very healthy free cash flow, should we assume the same level of share buyback in Q2 that we saw in Q1?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think it will probably increase a little bit on a net basis.","Operator","And our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Maybe I missed this, but how many shares did you buy back in the quarter, please?","John D. Wren","Somebody has that, and they're getting it for you.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes. There's really 2 numbers. They're like, one is what we bought and the other is what we bought, net. So we spent about $152 million net, so that'd be about -- I think we reduced the share count probably about 3 million, but we bought 5.3 million shares.","Craig Huber","Okay, very good. And then generally each quarter, your quarterly target is about $1 billion for net new client billings. What was that number this quarter, please?","Randall J. Weisenburger","It was about $1.1 billion.","Craig Huber","Okay. And then your organic growth in the quarter about 5.1%, Randy or John, would you say roughly half of that was from net new wins and half was from existing business? How would you break that down, roughly?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Don't know. That's not a number that we can really get to very easily.","Craig Huber","Okay, my last...","John D. Wren","It's been years back. It's never -- new business is never as much as half. Just as a generalization, historically speaking, it's generally about 1\/3.","Craig Huber","And then last, if I could, your comments on pharma, do you expect that to be dogging you for the rest of the year? What's your current thoughts on that, please?","John D. Wren","In part, some of the delays and the setbacks we have is that drugs, which we had anticipated, were going to get approval and be out in the market. We didn't get that final approval. In one case, we lost a few pieces of business, but we've since won more business in the same therapeutic category. I think it's going to be a tough year for -- in the pharma business. We might see a slight improvement over what we saw in the first quarter, but it's still going to be a tough year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Chesler with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you've made the comments in your prepared remarks about the upside versus your internal forecast at the revenue because revenue specifically you highlighted on exceeded your forecast. Was that PR based on the prior conversation, or maybe could you elaborate a little bit more into -- whether that came by discipline or by industry or even if there was any timing within the quarter?","John D. Wren","There certainly wasn't too much in the way of timing. I think it was across the board, to tell you the truth.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes, I think it was really across the board. Our brand communications businesses were very strong in the quarter. New business wins over the past few quarters have been very strong. Never quite know with some of the new business wins when the revenue is going to actually start coming through fully. So I think it's a combination of things.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So in terms of timing then, I mean, would you -- was March -- was there any acceleration of revenue growth throughout the quarter in March, or was that in line with your internal forecast?","Randall J. Weisenburger","It was pretty steady throughout the quarter.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Finally then, just almost, I'm sensing a little bit of change in tone with regards to your proclivity for acquisition opportunities in Asia or particularly China relative to what you've done in the past. Is that just me, or are you finding that the target opportunities are becoming more appealing or your ability to analyze them and gain comfort with them has at all changed?","John D. Wren","I don't think -- well, we certainly wouldn't want to think we've changed. We continue to look and we're getting closer on a number of possibilities.","Randall J. Weisenburger","See, acquisitions in that region take quite a bit of time. We closed this quarter the NIM acquisition, which we've been working on for over a year. I remember having met with them several times last year, possibly even the year before. So transactions in that region can take some time. I think we're just as committed to looking and have just as good a pipeline, maybe even a better pipeline than we've had over the past and certainly have a lot of resources focused on it.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like that the acquisition pipeline is looking pretty robust, that the activity may pick up. If I look at your leverage ratio, you guys restored your leverage back up to the pre-downturn levels but here it is, it creeps back down just through some natural deleveraging. Should we expect that to go back up perhaps as a result of the acquisitions?","Randall J. Weisenburger","It wouldn't be as a result of acquisitions. It would be our desire to increase or just adjust our leverage. We control our leverage really through the amount of share repurchases that we do. We would love to spend as much money, frankly, as we can on good quality acquisitions that create a lot of value for our shareholders. The balance of the money really is how much stock we repurchase.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Two questions. First, with some news during the quarter about a unique relationship for Chevy that you created with Interpublic commonwealth, just hoping to hear a little bit more background on how that came about and what we should expect for operations going forward in decision-making. And then second and sort of separately, a big picture question around sort of the rise of social media platforms and brands taking more advantage of earned media opportunities and being able to get their messages out through some of the free platforms out there. And just maybe interested in your high-level thoughts on how that type of work changes the dynamic for your agencies in terms of the percentage of budget that they're able to capture versus a traditional paid media type of work?","John D. Wren","Well in the first instance, Commonwealth. I was invited by Jeff Goodby, he's been a partner of mine since 1989, to listen to an interesting concept and the concept was that he believed that the work that they do on Chevy, plus he pointed out 3 outstanding creative guys which are in the McCann group, really should get together and form some kind of a new entity to aid in the resurgence of Chevy as the leading global brand and asked if we would entertain an unusual situation, which was Commonwealth, and do a partnership with IPG. Knowing and trusting Jeff as much as I do and knowing the objective of what they're trying to accomplish and knowing 2 of the 3 other creative guys, it was a pretty simple decision for us to agree to it. And it resulted in Michael Roth and I shaking hands and saying that we'd make it work. And your second question?","Randall J. Weisenburger","As far as social media or earned media platforms, they have been -- or that trend has been a factor now for a while and is certainly one of the drivers that are helping our industry outpace, I will say, normal industry growth or normal GDP type growth. Obviously, market is getting more complex as there's more and more of these platforms and more media opportunities or communication opportunities with potential customers. It's our agencies jobs to come up with innovative marketing solutions for their clients utilizing the full array of marketing mediums and technologies that are available. Obviously, that takes a lot of time and in general, we're getting paid for our time.","John D. Wren","I'd say that social media is a central part though of just about all the major campaigns that we do today. And it's a big part of what our PR companies do. It's a big part of what our advertising agencies do. It's a big part of what our media companies do. And if you're there, I bet you in May when we sit with -- we discern who -- what campaigns did well in Con and some other festivals, we're going to find fully integrated ones that really took advantages of the social media and had earned and unearned media associated with the ones that are going to succeed.","Operator","Question comes from James Dix with Wedbush.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. I guess on the growth outlook, any color you can give on how your view of the growth environment has changed over the past quarter. Obviously, the first quarter growth was better than you expected. I'm just wondering if that's continuing through toward the outlook that you have just going forward. And then I guess, kind of secondarily to that, your growth comparison for the second quarter gets a little bit tougher. Is that something that we should be using to maybe not assume maybe quite the same robust growth in the second quarter? And then I had just one follow-up.","John D. Wren","Sure. If you're comparing to last year's second quarter, that was an outlier, an outperformer last year. I think -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, I think it was something on the order of 8.4%. So I don't expect that. That was -- there were a lot of unique reasons for that, and plus the business over the years has flattened out a little bit so to follow the historic patterns of what it did in 2007 even. So we have concerns. We're cautiously optimistic. Europe has to remain stable and not affect the rest of the world. The U.S. has to continue to grow, and Asia looks okay now whereas a week ago, I might have had greater uncertainty, so it's not something we can predict. It's something we prepare for and then we take advantage of when we can.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I've been reading that people are saying 3% to 5% growth for the year. While we don't give forecast or guidance, 3% to 5% sounds certainly like a reasonable range. We peg this, we probably say 4%, plus or minus 1%, which I guess gets us to that same 3% to 5% spot.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","But your view of that really hasn't changed too much year-to-date?","John D. Wren","No. No. I mean the areas we can control are below revenue. And that's what our -- that's where we spend a great deal of time. And we make sure we're prepared to take advantage of revenue opportunities when they arise.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one follow-up, just on the acquisition environment which you touched on before. I mean, do you have any general sense; if you looked at everything that was in your pipeline now and things closed in line with some reasonable expectation on timing as to what the full year impact to that would be, you gave some outlook for the second quarter. But I'm just trying to get a little bit better sense of the size of the pipeline, obviously allowing for the fact that sometimes things are not going to close as you expect.","John D. Wren","Well, I'm the wrong guy. I don't get paid to guess. A projection of acquisitions when they'd hit.","Randall J. Weisenburger","No, that's impossible to really forecast. We don't close deals until they're ready, until we've completed our work, until we're confident that they can be properly integrated into our business and to our accounting of financial systems. When that all comes together, the deal closes.","John D. Wren","Oftentimes, getting a handshake is the easiest part of the process and then making certain that procedures and everything else are in alignment take a disproportionate -- take an appropriate, apparently, amount of time, but take a long time.","Operator","And the next question comes from Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Two questions, one related to underlying growth trends. Inside of advertising, you mentioned media is a contributing factor. Are the creative agencies generally still growing recently at this point in time? And inside of that sector, to what degree is the barter business or the trading desk contributing to growth? A second, semi-related separate question. We've seen consultancies such as IBM, Accenture and now even Australia Deloitte is starting to get into the marketing services business as CIO and CMO responsibilities are starting to intersect. Love to hear your views on how that is evolving in terms of competitive landscape.","John D. Wren","Second one first. There'll always be competitors. The difference in the people that you mentioned versus what the more traditional holding companies do is there's advice and then there's execution of a program. Giving advice is simple. Getting into the foxhole with the client and executing on the plan and making certain that it works is a bit more complex. So whereas there will always be competition and competition for certain aspects of the business, I don't see the people that you mentioned coming into our sweet spot anytime soon. But we're vigilant as always. And the first part of your question?","Randall J. Weisenburger","The first part was were the creative agencies growing and absolutely. They're big drivers, and that's somewhat of a disconnect in the idea that there's digital firms growing and there's the creative firms. Well in our approach, our creative firms are fully integrated. They're coming up with great ideas and executing those ideas across mediums and disciplines and whether it's social media, online or great TV, they're the center of that idea creation and execution. We also mentioned our media companies growing. Our media business has been doing extremely well across fronts, both in I'll say more traditional media, although I'm not sure that exists anymore because the programs are mostly integrated. But they've developed excellent digital capabilities and analytics capabilities, all of which are helping them to drive their growth.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","And any thoughts about barter and trading desks as the contributing factors?","John D. Wren","Barter is about flat year-over-year. It is a business. Trading desk is an incredible platform, and its limitations are -- it's only limited by the amount of inventory it can free from the publishers, which we're always working on exchanges and private exchanges and the like to get value that we want. So that's a business that -- that's a business of the present and the future, and it will only grow as times go on.","Operator","And the next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First for Randy, just a housekeeping question. If you could please breakout salary and service expenses from office and general expenses, if you have that, that'd be great.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think we included it in the presentation.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It might be. I didn't see it. I could follow up offline, if that's easier for you.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I got it. Salary and service is $2,434,400,000 and office and general is $510.4 billion.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then more broadly for John, when you think about -- you've talked about digital quite a bit. When you think about the acceleration we're seeing in mobile and apps on mobile, it feels like business explosion of volume and usage, but mobile and app media pricing remains well below PC. I'm just wondering what you're hearing from your clients on this? Are you advising them to more dramatically raise their allocation to mobile? Can you talk about mobile and apps as it relates to branding for your clients? And maybe what does the market need to see for there to be a catch-up on the demand side to keep up with all this tremendous explosion in usage?","John D. Wren","Sure. The spending is not there yet. I start everyone in my CEO meetings with the fact that whatever we have to talk about, it's going to be mobile first at some point. I see the device eventually being the equivalent of when they introduced remote controls into living rooms. It will dictate your life someday and as a result, marketing allows tremendous impact. I think no one from our side has cracked meaningful, engaging type of advertising on the phone yet. That's still in test. I think once that happens, you'll see budgets follow it rather vigorously. Apps are cool, but apps aren't the solution, in my opinion.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Do you think it's a technology thing that has to happen, adapting branded campaigns to the form factor of mobile or do you think it's just a mentality that needs to shift more dramatically in the mindset of the CMOs and your clients?","John D. Wren","Well, let me put it this way. I agree with your premise that it is going to be explosive in the future. I don't really have the solution in my mind, but I'd have to be honest with you. If I did have the solution, I wouldn't disclose it in this conference call. I'd execute it, and that's why you'd see it. But we're working on it. We're certainly working on it.","Operator","And our next question is from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I want to ask you about China, Russia, India and Latin America. Has your appetite to go after domestic clients there increased at all, or are we really looking at growth that's being fueled by your relationships with that top 250 clients, the multinationals you talked about?","John D. Wren","We will have to do that by market as opposed to the broad list that you gave. In China, naturally we're after the 250 and then what we're after, and we have some examples of it already like Huawei, of large Chinese companies that are either going to become global or are, in fact, global. Those are our immediate targets. We're learning every day about the local market. Oftentimes, very local market advertising opportunities. We can't compete against local Chinese firms. What are some of the other markets you mentioned?","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just Russia, India and Lat Am, the markets that you highlighted as continuing that strong growth.","John D. Wren","Russia, again, multinationals are big and there's are a lot of large Russian companies that are important on a global or certainly European basis, and we're able to do that. Plus Russia, a lot of our businesses which are DOS-type businesses like the branding businesses and the luxury businesses that we have, exploded in markets like China and like Russia.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So would you look at a different growth profile for the domestic businesses versus the multinationals where you have existing relationships, or are they fairly consistent do you think?","John D. Wren","We look at...","Randall J. Weisenburger","They're the same business. So it's our businesses with just a different from profile. In China, we're probably 85% or 90% multinationals. In Russia, we're probably 50% or 60% multinationals. Latin America, I think is fairly similar to that, probably in that 50% range. So really depends upon the market.","John D. Wren","And it depends upon -- when you really break it down, it depends upon the clients. Banks in local markets are easier to do than grocery stores.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think we've got time for one more call assuming or one more question, assuming there's one in the queue.","Operator","And that will come from Michael Nathanson with Nomura.","Robert Fishman - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","It's actually Robert Fishman calling in from Michael. Wondering if you could help us with a couple of expense questions. First, when you think about the office and general line, just curious how you think about the pace going forward as it grew in the low single digits in the first quarter. How should we think about for the rest of the year?","Randall J. Weisenburger","It tends to be the more stable of our lines. It's obviously smaller, so smaller variances can bounce around. But it is less highly correlated to revenue, obviously, than salary and service.","Robert Fishman - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Are there areas for cost savings going forward given some of the opportunities that you discussed earlier?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes, but there's also areas of investment that are also going on. Our job is to try to balance the 2 of them out and deliver overall margin, so we're very comfortable in being able to achieve our margin targets for 2012. Where that's going to actually come out or which line item, I think we're -- I think that's a little hard to predict.","Robert Fishman - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Can you help us just with the ending employee count at the end of the quarter?","John D. Wren","That's one off of my head.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Not off the top of my head. If -- we'll get back to you with a number, assuming we have it at this point.","Robert Fishman - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, great. And just last question, how should we think about the pace of the buyback through the year? Is it just really going to fluctuate based on free cash flow generation?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes. Basically, we use our share repurchases for 2 things. We're committed to spending all of our free cash flow on a combination of dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. Acquisitions is, obviously, the one that is most difficult at the time. We use share repurchases to basically balance that out and also to balance out the leverage levels that we want to have. In all likelihood, we'll probably -- if we follow a similar pattern to past, we'll probably buy more shares in the first half of the year, see how acquisitions go and then sort of finish the year out at the leverage levels that we want. And thank you all for taking the time to listen to our call.","John D. Wren","Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to now introduce you to today's conference call host, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Omnicom Group, Mr. Randall Weisenburger. Please go ahead.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our fourth quarter earnings call. We hope everyone had a chance to review our earnings release. We've posted to our website both the press release and our presentation covering the information that we'd be presenting this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","But before we start, I've been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that's included on the last page of our investor presentation. I've also been asked to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and that those statements are our present expectations, and actual events or results may differ.","We also want to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.","Now we're going to begin the call with remarks from John Wren. Following John's remarks, we'll review our financial performance for the quarter, and then we'll open the call up for questions.","John D. Wren","Good morning. I'm pleased to speak to you this morning about our fourth quarter business results and the progress we are making against our key strategic initiatives and my thoughts about the rest of the year. Hopefully, all of you had a chance to review our financial results and have seen our press release this morning, increasing our quarterly dividend 33% to $0.40 per share. Thanks to an exceptional list of clients and the commitment, talent and creativity of our people, we finished the fourth quarter and the full year 2012 in a very strong position.","We enter into 2013 well prepared to respond to the continued changes in the marketplace. While the macroeconomic environment appears to be stabilizing and even improving in some areas, issues in several markets still remain unresolved. As a result, we plan for another year of modest global growth, but remain nimble enough to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. At this point in our planning, we remain focused on controlling our costs and increasing productivity. But we are cautiously optimistic as we look into the latter part of 2013 and into 2014. Let me discuss our key markets in more detail.","In the U.S., the election has settled one set of questions, but the long-term fiscal imbalances and the mounting government debt still need to be addressed. The impending decisions to be made by Congress and the administration will impact overall economic growth this year. As we have proven in the past, our operations have consistently outperformed GDP in the U.S., and we are hopeful that the slow but steady economic improvements we have seen will continue.","In Europe, we sense greater stability, but many markets remain weak and growth is likely to be slow for some time, as governments pursue structural changes in their economies and continue to operate with fiscal restraint. In the developing markets, we see stronger growth, particularly in Asia and Latin America, as those economies appear to be navigating well despite challenges in other parts of the world.","For 2012, despite all the challenges offset in part by the Olympic contribution, we generated solid organic growth and achieved our margin objectives. Before getting into specifics of our fourth quarter and 2012, I'd like to highlight the strategies that have allowed us to continue to grow and achieve our results: first, our investment in the best talent; next is our expansion of our global footprint and moving into new service areas; third, investing in our digital and analytical capability and assets around the world; finally, we continue to deliver innovative and integrated solutions using meaningful consumer insights across disciplines and platforms for the benefit of our clients.","Throughout the economic cycle, we have maintained our investments in our talent, development programs, and these will continue as a key priority across our company. It is this culture that allows our agencies to consistently attract the best talent, which, once again, was recognized around the world for their work in 2012. Let me mention just a few awards.","Adweek named PHD Media Agency of the Year. DDB was Campaign's Advertising Network of the Year. BBDO finished first in the Gunn Report 2012 Most Awarded Agency Networks in the World for the seventh year in a row and topped The Big Won awards for the sixth consecutive year. Ketchum was named 2012 Agency of the Year by PRWeek. And in December, our agencies won a record number of creative awards at the 2012 Campaign Asia-Pacific and Greater China Agency of the Year awards held in Singapore and Shanghai, significantly outpacing our competition. I want to congratulate all of our employees and agencies for their outstanding creativity in 2012.","During the year, we continue to expand our presence in key emerging markets through strategic acquisitions. Most recently, we completed the acquisition of Magnon Group, one of India's leading and most comprehensive digital agencies. And last year, we also completed the acquisition of NIM Digital, a leading agency in China specializing in media planning and buying, search and digital production services. And then, in the fourth quarter, we also acquired a number of companies that extended our capabilities in consumer insights and analytics.","Equally as important as these acquisitions are the ongoing organic investments we are making in our networks and agencies. In 2012, our networks extended their geographic reach in countries including India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam and partnered with agencies in Miramar to support the efforts of our clients. Our agencies are also experimenting with new technologies and building new platforms at an astonishing pace. We continue to support them with the strategy that remains distinct in the industry by building our digital capabilities within our agencies, not beside them.","From shopper marketing to CRM, to PR, to advertising and to media and across all of our disciplines, I am extremely pleased with the ability of our agencies to innovate and be leaders in using the new digital mediums and technologies to better service our clients. These new technologies are also generating terabytes of data that is changing the way advertisers buy and sell ads, target audiences and measure campaigns' effectiveness.","At Annalect, Omnicom's primary data and analytical business, our team is aggressively working with partners and clients to collect this vast array of global and local data, centralize it, secure it, analyze it and translate it, empowering users to make better marketing decisions. And our agencies are hiring talent with new skills sets, such as PHDs, behavioral analysts and data scientists to provide actionable insights using this trove of data. These efforts are driving a tangible shift in how our agencies work together and are delivering benefits to our clients in the form of stronger, more consistent and ultimately, more effective communications. And they're allowing us to deliver integrated campaigns across disciplines and platforms.","With that said, technologies will come and go at mach speed. We believe the world will become increasingly complex and fragmented. As a result, we've maintained an open partnership approach with technology leaders, as opposed to making bets on specific platforms. This approach allows us to have access to the latest technologies to adapt our services and seamlessly integrate digital within our clients' marketing strategy. Overall, these acquisitions, investments and partnerships serve multiple roles in supporting our strategic direction, expand our footprint, increase our talent base and deepen our capabilities. We've made tremendous progress in 2012, and we will continue to pursue these strategies in 2013 and beyond.","Now I want to talk briefly about how our efforts impacted the fourth quarter and 2012. Organic growth in the fourth quarter was 2.7%. This performance was driven by both the U.S. and international markets, with the notable exception of the euro countries, which was a drag on growth. For the full year, organic growth was a very strong 4%. Randy will cover the performance market by market during his remarks.","On the margin front, we'd achieved our target margin for the year of 13.4%. As you know, this was the result of a thorough process to review our portfolio of businesses and drive operational improvements that began at the end of 2010. Even with this progress, we will continue to pursue operational improvements on an agency-by-agency basis in 2013.","Looking at our capital structure and use of cash during 2012. We continued to look for ways to maximize the use of our strong cash flows, while maintaining a solid balance sheet, and we were successful on both counts. For the year, we returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while our credit ratings and leverage ratios remained extremely strong. Since 2002, we have returned approximately 99% of net income to our shareholders.","Looking forward, our philosophy on use of cash will be consistent with our past practices. We will deliver steady cash payments through our dividends. With our announcement to increase our dividend this morning, we have doubled our dividend per share since 2010. We will seek acquisitions that expand our capabilities in new practice areas and markets, and we will continue to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. Similarly, our core strategies to achieve growth remain the same: finding and retaining the best talent; build a presence in markets that matter today and into the future; improve operating margins through greater productivity; and create deep expertise and partnerships in consumer insights, analytics, social, mobile and other emerging platforms.","As I visit our agencies, I'm consistently impressed by the high caliber of talent that we have, from management on down. Our talent pool is also expanding as we grow our geographic footprint in developing markets. Omnicom today operates at over 100 countries around the world. Our focus on expanding our local presence is allowing us to better serve our global clients and is giving us access to local clients in the developing markets that may be the next decade's biggest brands. Even as we expand, we are driving greater collaboration and integration across our organization and particularly for our largest clients. As a result, we are seeing better communication, more insights, better creative and better business results on behalf of our clients.","I'll now turn the call back to Randy, who will take you through the numbers.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Thank you, John. It was a good quarter and a good year. There certainly was a lot going on this past year, with the Olympics, the U.S. elections, a sustained economic recession across much of Europe and at best, a lackluster recovery in the U.S., to mention a few. But through it all, I think our agencies performed exceptionally well. And as John pointed out, they again led the industry in each of the major markets around the world from a creative and innovation perspective. They led the industry in organic growth by delivering innovative solutions to their clients using both new and established technologies. And through relentless focus on cost control, they were able to return our aggregate operating margins to their prerecession levels.","Now for the quarter. Due to stronger-than-expected organic growth, revenue for the quarter came in a little better than we had expected, up 2.4% to $3.9 billion. And that resulted in full year revenue of $14.2 billion, which was an increase of 2.5%. Organic growth for the quarter was 2.7% and was just over 4% for the full year.","Due to the outstanding efforts of our agency management teams in controlling cost, EBITDA was very strong, increasing 12.3% to $574 million for the quarter. Margins were 14.5%, up about 120 basis points from last year. And as expected, due to the combination of solid organic growth and our agencies' focus on containing cost, we were able to return our full year EBITDA margin to our 2007 level of 13.4%. Similarly, operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased 12.4% to $548 million, and our resulting operating margin was 13.9%, also a year-over-year improvement of about 120 basis points.","On Slide 2, we'll address the items below operating income. First, net interest expense for the quarter was $40.3 million, up $10 million from Q4 of last year and effectively unchanged from Q3. The year-over-year increase is due to interest on the $1.25 billion of 10-year notes we issued in Q2 and Q3, then partially offset by additional interest income earned on our cash balances.","Next is taxes. Our effective tax rate decreased to 27% for Q4 and to 31.8% for the full year. There were several items, both positive and negative, that impacted our taxes this quarter. The 2 larger items were: first, income tax expense was reduced by $53 million, primarily as a result of the completion in Q4 of a reorganization of our holdings in the Asia Pacific region. As a result, our unremitted earnings in the affected countries in the region will be subject to a lower effective tax rate. Accordingly, we reduced our deferred tax liabilities to reflect these lower rates.","And second, we took a tax charge of approximately $16 million in the quarter related to our an ongoing state and local tax audit. The good news, going forward, we expect the recurring benefit of the reorganization to be approximately $11 million per year, which should bring our normal operating tax rate down from 34.3% to about 33.6%.","Next, income from equity method investments or affiliates was down about $34 million from last year. In the quarter, we recorded an impairment charge related to our investment in an affiliate in Egypt. While the affiliate continues to be one of the leading agency groups in Egypt, due to the political and economic issues in the country over the past couple of years, this financial performance has lagged. As a result, we determined that our investment was impaired, and we took a charge of $29.2 million.","Excluding the impairment, income from our equity method investments declined by $4.5 million, in part because we no longer record affiliate income from our Turkish affiliate after making an additional investment, which resulted in that agency becoming a consolidated subsidiary. The balance was due to a combination of FX and operating performance.","And finally, income allocated to noncontrolling interest or our minority partners increased by $1.2 million. That was mostly related to the positive performance of those agencies. As a result, net income for Q4 increased 12.9% to $307 million, bringing our full year net income up to $998 million.","On Slide 3, we show the allocation of net income to common shareholders and to participating securities for [ph] our restricted stock. Net income for common shareholders increased 11.7% to $300 million. This chart also shows our diluted share count. As a result of our ongoing share repurchase activities, our diluted share count for the quarter was down year-over-year about 5.3%. The combination of increased net income and reduced share count resulted in diluted EPS of $1.13, which was a 17.7% increase.","On the next few slides, we'll take a closer look at our revenue performance, first, with regard to FX. Unlike in previous quarters, in Q4, the dollar had mixed performance. Some of the larger markets that the dollar weakened against include the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the renminbi and the Aussie dollar; and the larger markets having a negative impact include the euro, the real, the rupee and the yen. The net result reduced our revenue for the quarter by 0.7% or about $28 million. Looking ahead, if FX rate stays at their current levels, the FX impact on revenue would be minimal in Q1 and would be marginally positive for full year 2013.","Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased our revenue by $15 million in the quarter or 0.4%. We completed 5 new acquisitions in the quarter, and I believe, 14 over the course of the year. At this point, if we don't complete another acquisition or disposition, we expect net acquisition revenue to be positive about 50 basis points in Q1 and would be positive about 20 basis points for the full year.","With regard to organic revenue growth, as I mentioned, it was a little bit stronger than we had expected coming into the quarter, but performance has been increasingly mixed by market and industry sector. Overall, organic growth was positive 2.7% or about $105 million in the quarter. In general, we have performed well in North America, South America, Asia and Russia, but Europe weakened further in a number of markets. And our new business performance continue to be solid in the quarter, with net wins of right around $1 billion.","Turning to our mix of business on Slide 5. Brand advertising accounted for 49% of our revenue, and marketing services, 51%. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 5.4%, driven by continued strong growth in our media businesses, emerging markets and new technology services, and marketing services was up 0.2%. Within marketing services, CRM was down 1.6% in the quarter, in part due to weakness in Europe and in part due to the performance of our field marketing businesses. Public relations had a great quarter, up 8.4%. Our large PR networks have been doing well for a couple of quarters now, but it wasn't really translating to the numbers. It was nice to see their great work come through to the results this quarter. And finally, specialty communications was basically flat, which was a significant improvement over the last several quarters.","Turning to Slide 6 and 7. Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was split: 51%, U.S.; 17%, euro markets; 9%, U.K.; and 23%, rest of the world. In the United States, revenue increased $98 million or 5.1%. Organic growth was 5% or $96 million. The strong performance is led by our media businesses. But generally, we had good performance across our agencies. And acquisitions, net of dispositions, was marginally positive, adding $2.4 million.","International revenue decreased $6 million or about 0.3%. As mentioned earlier, FX continue to have a negative impact, resulting in a decline of about 1.5% or $28 million. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by about $13 million or 0.7%. And organic growth in the aggregate was positive $9.2 million or 0.5%. As I mentioned, it was very mixed by market.","In our larger European markets, Russia continue to perform very well, while the U.K., France and Germany remained weak. And in aggregate, the Eurozone markets were down 3.7%. In Asia, we continue to have strong performances across the region, with India, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia leading the way this quarter. And in Latin America, our Brazilian operations continue to perform very well.","Slide 8 shows our mix of business by industry. Given the size and diversity of our client base, at this point, our mix of business by industry sector is pretty stable. As for growth rates, for the year, we had very strong performance in retail, driven by a combination of new business wins and client increases, but we also had good performance in the auto and technology sectors. On the other side of the spectrum, financial services was pulled down by the loss of Bank of America, and telecom was impacted by the loss of Sprint.","Turning to Slide 9. We had another good cash flow year. In aggregate, our free cash flow increased about $179 million over last year, that is excluding changes in working capital. On Slide 10, the breakdown of primary uses of cash for the year included dividends to common shareholders of $398 million. The year-over-year increase reflects both the 20% increase in our quarterly dividend that we instituted at the beginning of last year and the acceleration of our January dividend into Q4, in effect, paying 5 quarterly dividends in 2012.","Dividends paid to our minority interest shareholders totaled $98 million. Capital expenditures totaled $226 million. As we've mentioned before, CapEx was up due to a couple of sizable office makeovers related to long-term lease renewals. We also had the purchase of an office building for one of our agencies and our ongoing IT consolidation initiatives. Acquisitions, including contingent purchase price payments, totaled $188 million and share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances, totaled $832 million. In aggregate, we outspent our free cash flow by about $317 million for the year.","Slide 11 shows our current capital structure. Year-over-year, our total debt increased by about $1.3 billion to $4.46 billion, almost entirely related to the issuance of the $1.25 billion in 10-year senior notes during the second and third quarters of the year. More important, our net debt position at the end of the year was $1.76 billion, an increase of $368 million from last year. As a result of the increased debt, our total-debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2.1x, although our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio remained very low at 0.8x, and our interest coverage ratio remains robust at 11.6x.","On Slide 12, as we continue to successfully build the company through a combination of prudently-priced acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives, both our return on invested capital and return on equity continue to lead the industry. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital remained pretty stable at 18.6% and our return on equity improved a little further to 28.7%.","And finally, on Slide 13, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2002 through year-end, which totaled $9.12 billion. And the line just below the top line shows our cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, which totaled $9.05 billion. The result is a combined payout ratio of almost 99%. I also want to point out that during that period, our agencies were able to more than double revenue from $6.9 billion to $14.2 billion. And more important, they were able to more than double our net income from $455 million to $998 million.","With that, that concludes our prepared remarks. There are several other supplemental slides included in the presentation, but at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to James Dix with Wedbush Securities.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just 2 things. I guess one, what was driving the particularly strong growth organically that you saw in the U.S. in the fourth quarter? I know you've, in the past, cautioned people not to focus too much on particular quarters in particular regions, but it is an important region for you. And then, just looking into 2013. I mean, is your outlook for the U.S. at the moment kind of in line with your outlook for kind of modest global growth? Or is your outlook for the U.S. a little bit faster or slower than that?","John D. Wren","First, with respect to the fourth quarter. I think we've been saying this consistently for a very long period of time. There's a certain element of budget which is very difficult to predict as to whether clients are going to spend it or if it's actionable, if they're going to delay spending. What we saw throughout the quarter, especially after the election in the U.S., was a commitment by clients to continue to spend those budgets to try to increase their market share. And that's the attitude today across the board, I think, on most of our major clients, especially in the U.S. At this point, in terms of what we expect, there's still a bit of uncertainty out there, and from a consumer point of view, we haven't had enough time nor data to measure the impact of the -- not the upper-bracket tax rates, but the payroll tax -- $1,000 that Congress took away. And there's still uncertainty on the part of many clients as to how the U.S. government is going to deal with sequester. So it's a little bit too early for us to give you an accurate prediction, but we're planning our business for modest growth. And being a service business, we think that's prudent because that helps us contain costs while staying nimble enough, as I said earlier, to take advantage of spending as it comes through.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","This growth -- I mean, do you mean like growth slightly lower than what you saw in 2012? I know at some conferences, you've made some allusions to what you mean by that. But if you had any more granularity given this opportunity, that would be great, and then I'm done.","Randall J. Weisenburger","This is Randy. My personal view is 2013 feels a lot like 2012 from, I'll say, an economic backdrop standpoint. But we don't have the Olympics this year. So I certainly think there's a little bit of spending, a little bit of revenue on our numbers, yes, associated with the Olympics that's likely not to be there next year. That's probably about as accurate as we can get at this point.","Operator","Next question is from Alexia Quadrani with; JP Morgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is just on the euro markets and the softening we saw on the quarter. I guess, any comment on how that progressed. I mean, did it get worse as the quarter went on? Should we assume it will continue to weaken a bit in the first quarter? Or should it be -- are you looking at a bit more stability in 2013? I know it's difficult to predict, but any color you can give us would be great.","John D. Wren","Some of the decline were -- can be tracked to specific client reductions, as opposed to economic situations. The marketplace there -- I mean, Europe is in an uncertain position. We don't expect any vast improvements any time soon. And we're planning accordingly, Alexia, so -- and hopeful that were -- that it's brighter than that, but I...","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes, I think that's right. I mean I can't tell you how they tracked over the course of the quarter. I haven't looked at that. I do think the positive performance that we had in Europe was literally driven by strong specific agency performance, new business wins, innovative ideas for clients that drove the growth rather than economic growth.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess in terms of how you're budgeting, you're not necessarily assuming a step-down, or are you just being very careful on cost because you don't really know what the environment will come out in?","John D. Wren","Sure, we're not planning a step-down at this point, but we're not planning any outbreak of growth either, so it's a steady-state. Plus, costs there, if you make the mistake of adding them, they get to be very expensive when you try to take them out. So we've been prudent, but we haven't -- there hasn't been a dramatic change.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, jumping back to the U.S. The decrease in the pharma client base seem to have lessened a bit. Do you think we're sort of over the worst in that sector in terms of the dropoff? Or do you think it'd still be a challenge in '13?","John D. Wren","I think we're -- a lot of what affected our pharma business is probably behind us as -- so that's a great area for us, I think, in 2013 as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Wondering if you could offer a little bit more color on emerging markets. For the last 8 quarters or so -- or I guess I should say rest of world segment instead. For the last 8 quarters or so, we've seen a significant outperformance versus the U.S. This quarter is only 1 quarter, we realize, but just wondering if you could give us some color on your expectations for 2013, whether we could see an outperformance in rest of world or whether you think this 1 quarter portends a bit of a trend here. And then secondly, if you could give us any CapEx guidance for the year.","John D. Wren","We expect Asia to continue at or around the same pace that we saw in the fourth quarter. It's been strong. There's a lot of client activity going on. Clients have diverted money that was spent in other places to Asia because that's where the consumer seems the healthiest. And Japan showed signs of vitality in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to continue also, at least for the first half.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Where there any particular areas of weakness in rest of world? Or is this indicative of maybe agency performance, the deceleration, or a macro?","Randall J. Weisenburger","For rest of world? I think our rest of world numbers were -- I felt they were pretty good. We had strong performance in Brazil, Russia, Singapore, India. This quarter, Japan, which is a large market for us -- it's obviously a large market and hasn't been a fairly robust economic backdrop, so our agencies in that market this quarter performed very well in that backdrop. The Middle East has been, I'll say, mixed at times. That probably covers most of it.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then, Randy, any CapEx guidance for the year given the level of investments this year?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think it will be probably down a little bit from this year. As I mentioned, in 2012, we had a couple large real estate projects going on. We bought a building for one of our agencies, so that was $15 million, $16 million. Obviously, not a huge building. We still have some IT consolidation initiatives going on that will increase CapEx relative to a normal base. But I don't know of any major moves or rebuilds at this point. So I would suspect it will come down a little bit.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Hearing your comments on the top line, could you please give a little color on the cost side for 2013? Understanding that you are paying your staff and just wondering what sort of internal cost you may yet be able to squeeze out. And in that context, if there is any sort of comment you could give on guidance on margins for '13, please.","Randall J. Weisenburger","We -- at this point, we have to manage our agencies' margins agency by agency. We certainly have some agencies that are not performing at, I'll say, the appropriate margin level for them or their type of business, and we need to try to get them -- their costs more aligned with where their revenues and where their business is at. Overall, it's a difficult cost environment. We're 4 or 5 years into a relatively difficult economic environment in 65% or 70% of our revenue markets, so basically U.S. and Europe. So trying to hold costs flat or low growth is very difficult for that length of time. I feel comfortable being able to match our 2012 margins and continue to -- and have us continue to be able to invest in the growth and the development of the business that we've been doing and that we want to do. After that, we'll see how the margins ultimately work out, but our focus is on getting all of our agencies' margins right agency by agency and continue to invest in our people and our business.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Okay. And your acquisition number was slightly lower in 2012 than previous -- many previous years, I guess. Is there any comment on acquisition pipeline for 2013, please?","Randall J. Weisenburger","The pipeline is always good. What generally makes the difference in CapEx is if you -- if we're able to complete 1 or 2 large or midsized deals. In 2011, that would have been Mudra and I think Communispace and Clemenger, I guess. We didn't have deals -- we didn't have any deals of that size in 2012. I'm hopeful in 2013 that we will, but that's -- those deals are much more difficult to predict, I'll say, statistically. As far as another 10 to 15 similar acquisitions that we did in 2012, I think there's a pretty high probability that that will occur.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Nathanson with Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have 2, probably for Randy but maybe questions for John, too. Looking at your Slide 13, you look at the long-term return of capital to shareholders, and it's pretty impressive, but the mix of the returns, about 75% buybacks and 1\/4 dividends. And I wonder, looking at the next couple of years, do you see those 2 areas converging a bit, maybe raising the dividend at the expense of the buybacks? How do you think about the blend of capital returns?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Well, as John just pointed out, since 2010, we've doubled the dividend. We had a 33% increase in the dividend this year. So I think that's pretty much a sign that our expectation is that the dividend as a percentage of our payout is likely to go up.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And do you have a range of where you can get it to, you think, in terms of how you think about the payout ratio?","Randall J. Weisenburger","No.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Okay, so let me ask you this, on -- can you help us a bit on Q4 revenue, the expense line for O&G and salary? Rather than waiting for the K to come out, I wonder if you can give it to us.","John D. Wren","If you just give us 1 second -- or maybe more than 1 second.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes, why don't we go on and take another question, and when we get to the answer, we'll say it in the middle of the next question.","Operator","And we'll go to Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","My question is somewhat related. Do you have any sense of what your year-end headcount was?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes. It was around 72,000, plus or minus a little bit. Maybe -- I don't have it exact off the top of my head, 71,000-and-something the way we count it.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then...","Randall J. Weisenburger","71,099.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","71,099?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, excluding acquisition impact, is it fair to say that, given the revenue outlook, which is constructive but still a little iffy, that that should be a relatively flat number in '13?","John D. Wren","Our objective is not to -- we're expecting to grow there in 2013. But our expectations is that we're hiring behind our revenue, not in advance of our revenue, in most instances. Unless we're making an investment from a -- in a startup. There's 1 or 2 considered, but it won't drastically change that number.","Randall J. Weisenburger","And also, keep in mind that we have a mix of businesses that, headcount to revenue -- and we have a mix of countries that, headcount to revenue, are quite different. So I mean, if you're trying to use headcount as a proxy for something, you're probably not really doing yourself a good analysis.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","A lot of noise in the number, basically. Okay.","Randall J. Weisenburger","We're in a lot of countries, in a lot of different businesses. They're service businesses, and we're largely getting paid our cost of labor plus overhead in a margin, and that labor varies by skill level quite dramatically and by country quite dramatically.","Operator","Our next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I got a couple. I wanted to ask you about a couple...","Randall J. Weisenburger","Let me interrupt for 1 -- just 1 second and answer -- I think it was Peter's question. So salary and service costs in -- for the year was $10,380,700 and office and general was $2,034,500,000.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. Hopefully, that doesn't count as my question. All right, okay. So moving forward, so a couple of numbers you've spoken to in the past, either at conferences or on earnings calls, I think you had talked about '13 feeling like a 2% to 3% top line year versus the 4% in '12. You called out the Olympics and some -- obviously, it was a political year, but just wanted to see if that was still how you were feeling about things or maybe if there were some -- more upside potential than you thought a couple of months ago. And then the second number would be percent of free cash flow on dividends, buybacks and acquisitions. I think you did about 20% above your free cash in '12. You're carrying $2.7 billion of cash. I didn't know if that was because of the converts that are puttable coming up or anything else you'd speak to, but any help on the free cash flow spending appetite this year would also be helpful.","John D. Wren","Okay. Let's see, a few questions here. So I'll give you the free cash flow. That's probably the easiest. We issued the bonds last year, and we said that we would outspend our free cash flow in the $300 million to $500 million per year range for the next couple of years. We outspent our free cash flow in 2012 by about $313 million. I suspect we'll outspend our free cash flow in '13 by again $300 million to $500 million with that combination of dividends, buybacks and acquisitions. I made a statement earlier in the year trying to think about '13 versus '12. At the time, I felt '13 felt a little bit more difficult than '12. That was a few months ago. That was kind of right around the end of the elections and wrestling with what people were going to -- what the administration was going to do. So I think, today, I think -- and again, it's relatively unscientific. I think '13 probably feels pretty much like it felt going into '12, except for the Olympics. I think the Olympics probably added maybe 0.5 point to our revenue growth -- or to our revenue in 2012. So if that -- if we said we thought '12 was going to be 3.5% to 4% organic growth, I guess that would make it sort of 3% to 3.5% organic growth is the way it feels at that -- but again, it's pretty early in the year.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And can I just take a stab at the rest of world question again? For the first 9 months, that business was organically up 11% and then 4.4% in Q4. And doesn't sound like your -- from your comments earlier, there's anything to that that we should read going forward. But I just wanted to revisit that one more time.","John D. Wren","Could you repeat that question for us, please?","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. The rest of world category was up 11%, I think, for the first 9 months ending in the third quarter. And then, for Q4, just the organic growth, it was up 4.4%. And obviously, that's got Asian and Latin American in there. So I just didn't know if there's anything -- I think there was a question earlier. It didn't sound like there was anything to it, but I wanted to ask just since it's such an important region.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I don't think there's anything in the numbers. Again, I wouldn't look at any individual quarter. I'd really look at full year numbers. I think our agencies in those markets are doing quite well. We do -- as they grow, they become bigger numbers to grow on, which, by definition, over time, will slow the growth rates down a little bit. But the region will become more impactful, which is obviously positive.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Gregory Stein","This is Greg Stein for Craig Huber. I was just wondering what the project-related revenue was in 4Q '12 and then also what it was year ago as well.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I don't know. That's not something that we break out or collect.","Gregory Stein","Okay. How about, I guess, just your outlook for next year on auto? This year, you had a strong year, up 15%. What are you seeing for 2013?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think the auto sector overall looks relatively positive. And during the market commentary, people think the U.S. auto unit sales as an industry will be up in 2013, so that's obviously a positive. The auto sector is one that our revenues have tracked, I think, fairly well to global auto sales. So it should be -- if auto sales do take the positive trend people are talking about, it should be positive for our revenues in the sector.","Gregory Stein","Okay. And finally, sorry to be this specific, but I was wondering if you'd potentially break out your interest expense and interest income lines?","Randall J. Weisenburger","We'll get that number for you in 1 second. Also, I want to go back and I'll say, finish answering Peter's question. I gave you the breakout of salary and service and office and general for the full year. For Q4, the numbers were $2,889,100,000 for salary and service and $507.5 million for office and general. And for interest expense and interest income, let's see. I guess full year numbers, interest expense was $179.7 million and interest income was $35.1 million.","Given that we're getting pretty close here to 9:30, so we'll take one more question.","Operator","That will be from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So 2 things. First, John spent a lot of time at the beginning of the call talking about technology and digital. And you tend to capture more wallet share for yourselves rather than passing it onto media operators with digital, I would think. Can you talk about the time frame at which you think this -- could it lead to sort of a breakout beyond typical historical growth rates when you start skewing more digital after investing in it? And second question is, can you give us a little update about how things are going at Commonwealth and review for us where the accounting for Commonwealth is? Is it consolidated? And where is -- is it a consolidator account for a JV?","John D. Wren","Look, complexity is our friend. There's no doubt about it, because the more fragmented the market is and the more complex it is in terms of reaching the target audiences, it takes more very, very smart insightful people to accomplish that. That's a long-term trend, and it continues. I don't see it as a major breakout impacting our numbers within the near term more -- in any great variance to the steady state of growth that we've had. There's a lot on the horizon, and we think that trend is going to continue into the future. And it's, again, good for us.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So even if you went out like 3 to 5 years, do you think it would have the ability to kind of move the needle beyond average growth?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think it's moving the needle now. It will continue to move the needle. You have to keep in mind it's a very large industry. We're in a lot of different marketing areas, and it's a fairly concentrated industry. New technologies are allowing marketing to evolve. But I don't think there's a revolution in the change of what's going on. And is it possible the revolution will happen sometime in the future? I think it's possible. It's certainly not something that we predict at this point.","John D. Wren","And technological ability to do things and permission to do things are really at the core of some of this. If you look at privacy policy in the United States versus privacy policy in Europe, which -- and who will -- they are different, and both regions are taking different approaches. And we don't know how the rest of the world is -- which policy the rest of the world is going to lean into. So the more targeting that we can do, the better it is because it's a greater ROI for the client and everything becomes more and more measurable. So that's the move. But there's a number of open questions, but it's positive at the back of our business.","Randall J. Weisenburger","And on Commonwealth, we account for the revenues going to our agencies, or the work being performed by our agencies, and IPG accounts for the revenue and the profits of the work that their agencies are doing.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So it's just consolidated in -- within the agencies, right? And so...","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes. Each of us consolidate our piece. Neither one of us consolidates the aggregate of Commonwealth. So they -- IPG gets and it consolidates the revenue of the work their agencies do, and we would consolidate the revenue of the work our agencies do.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Does the development with Silverado and some of the account shifts, like did they move the needle at all this year? Does it affect the venture? Can you talk a little bit about that?","John D. Wren","No, it -- I mean, to a company our size, one account doesn't really move the needle one way or the other.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Thank you, all, very much, and thank you for taking the time to listen to our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"16317":["Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) Q1 2019 Results Conference Call April 16, 2019  9:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Shub Mukherjee - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","John Wren - President and Chief Executive Officer","Phil Angelastro - Chief Financial Officer","Jonathan Nelson - CEO, Omnicom Digital","Conference Call Participants","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets","Adrien De Saint Hilaire - Bank of America","Julien Roch - Barclays","Michael Nathanson - Moffett Nathanson","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Omnicom First Quarter 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to introduce your host of today's conference, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Shub Mukherjee. Please go ahead.","Shub Mukherjee","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our first quarter 2019 earnings call. On the call with me today is John Wren, President and Chief Executive Officer and Phil Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer.","We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release. We have posted to www.omnicomgroup.com this morning's press release along with the presentation covering the information that we will review this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our Web site.","Before we start, I have been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation. And to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially.","I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials. We are going to begin this morning's call with an overview of our business from John Wren. Then, Phil Angelastro, will review our financial results for the quarter. And then we will open up the line for your questions.","John Wren","Thank you, Shub. Good morning. I am pleased to speak to you this morning about our first quarter 2019 results. It's been two months since our last call and a lot has happened in that time, including kicking off a few strategic initiatives, promotions in our agency network leadership and some notable industry awards. Importantly, we got off to a good start with our financial results.","In the first quarter, organic growth was 2.5% and was in line with our internal targets. Our operating profits and EBITDA margins of 13% for the quarter exceeded our expectations. The improved performance is attributable to a number for factors, including the continuing benefits from Omnicom wide cost initiatives, the impact of dispositions completed in 2018 and a small gain from a few additional dispositions completed in the first quarter of 2019.","The upsides were offset in part by the negative effect of foreign exchange on our operating results. Phil will provide you more detail when he gets to his remarks. And EPS of the quarter was up 8.3% to $1.17 per share, excluding the impact of one-time tax benefit from the successful resolution of foreign tax claims recorded in the first quarter of 2018. The results continue to demonstrate the consistency and diversity of Omnicom's operations, our ability to deliver consumer centric strategic business solutions to our clients and our best in industry creative talent combined with market-leading digital, data and analytical expertise.","In the quarter, we grew organically in every geographic region of the world with the exception of Latin America. This growth was achieved through broad participation across all of our agencies, disciplines and clients sector. Looking first across disciplines, advertising and media was up 5.1%, CRM consumer experience was down less than 1%, strong performance in our precision marketing group business was offset by negative performance in our events business. Healthcare was up 6.8% with virtually all of our businesses in this discipline performing well.","PR was down 1.5%. We're seeing some positive signs in certain areas of our PR operations and believe the growth strategies being implemented by our management teams will result in better performance. And as expected CRM execution support was down 3.3%. During the quarter, we sold MarketStar, a provider of outsourced sales, support and services based in Utah. MarketStar is a very similar business to Sellbytel, which we sold in the third quarter of 2018. As I previously mentioned we also divested a few other small businesses in our portfolio during the quarter in line with our strategy of divesting non-core and underperforming operations.","Turning now to our performance by geography. The U.S. was up 2% in the quarter, driven by strong performance in advertising and media, healthcare and our precision marketing group, offset by the decline in our events business. The Omni U.S. for the North American region, primarily consisting of Canada, was up 6.1% in the quarter. The UK was up 1.3% led by advertising and media, precision marketing and healthcare. This performance was offset by declines in our events and CRM execution businesses. Overall, growth in Euro and non-Euro region was 4%. In the Euro markets, the Netherlands and Spain have better than average growth. And Germany also performed well. France was negative in the quarter, primarily due to the loss of the specialty print production client. In the non Euro markets, the Czech Republic and Russia had very good growth. Asia-Pacific's first quarter organic growth was 2.1% as Australia, India and New Zealand performed very well in the quarter. China was negatively impacted by the delay of several projects and events. It's our current expectations that these projects will go forward but later in the year. Latin America was down 3% as another quarter of solid operating results in Mexico was offset by the continuing negative performance in Brazil. We expect 2019 will continue to be a difficult year in Brazil. Our smallest region the Middle East and Africa grew 12.8%.","Let me now discuss what we're seeing in the industry and how our strategies enable us to achieve consistent financial performance. Over the past couple of years, Omnicom initiated numerous changes in response to our clients' needs. As a result, we are continuing to adjust and reorganize our businesses and management teams. In order to improve the speed of decision making, we're organized within our network structure into 12 practice areas. The last practice area we formed, the Omnicom Retail Group was announced in March. We've expanded the number of top clients in our global client leaders group from 25 to 100.","We have further consolidated our data and analytics, and technology services and investments at Annalect. We launched Omni, our proprietary data and analytics platform. The platform is in the process of being rolled out to our top clients. We've also expanded our investments in training and development of our people so they can use these tools. We have expanded our consulting services and capabilities. And we've consolidated our production services across all major markets. And as I will get to in a couple of minutes, we continue to streamline our media offerings. Expanding on some of these initiatives, in March, we announced the formation of a new center of excellence to advance our commerce capabilities, Omnicom Retail Group.","The new group is leveraging expertise to increase conversion and transactions for clients, both online and offline. It brings together five award winning agencies with exceptional creativity, strategic thinking and deep client and category experience. The Integer Group, TracyLocke, Haygarth, TPN and The Marketing Arm. These agencies together employ over 2,500 people across 19 markets. Omnicom's retail group agencies will continue to invest in advance shopper knowledge and drive innovation and thought leadership in shopper and retail marketing. Sophie Daranyi, formally the CEO of Haygarth, a creative agency specializing in brand, shopper and retail marketing, was named CEO of Omnicom Retail Group.","Turning now to our global client leaders group, we've expanded this group to 100 clients. The responsibilities of the global client leaders include ensuring our clients are receiving the highest quality, marketing and communication services from our agencies; creating and managing agile client teams with best of breed talent and skills; breaking down existing agency silos by organizing internal teams within and across practice area groups; and offering our clients the breadth of our services as their needs change. We also expanded our C-suite consulting services. Last year, we added Credera and Levo to our other consulting services, which include Batten, Daggerwing, Sparks and Honey, TLGG and several other consulting units that have been developed organically to serve our client needs. As a result, we are increasingly changing the manner in which we engage with our clients. As these practices develop, we expect to have more opportunities to offer our clients tip of the spear solutions that tackle business firms.","During the quarter, we also made some important strategic changes in our media operations. As you may recall, about a decade ago, we formed Accuen for programmatic services and Resolution Media for search, social and performance marketing. At the time, when these services were in their formative stages, we need dedicated units with real subject matter experts to support our media agencies. Today, these services are no longer a specialty. They are at the core of how we work with our media clients. As a result, we are fully integrating these capabilities involving about 600 people in the United States alone into our media agencies, Hearts and Science OMD and PHD. With this reorganization, we've simplified our structure by expanding the capabilities of our client teams. We expect these changes to increase our speed, agility and the quality of service to clients.","To further this effort, Omnicom Media Group made several management changes to ensure that the next generation of media agency leaders have an understanding of creativity and a deep expertise in digital, data and analytics. Scott Hagedorn was named CEO of North American operations at Omnicom Media Group, following his previous positions as the CEO of Hearts and Science and CEO of Annalect. He began his career as a brand planner at RAPP. Scott will be partnering with John Swift, who was named COO of Omnicom Media Group North America. John has substantial operating experience having led our U.S media buying organization, as well as developing a number of our specialty media business units.","With Scott's move, Erin Matts, who previously served as CEO of Annalect North America, has been named CEO of Hearts and Science in the U.S. Following the integration of Resolution Media and acumen capabilities into our media brands, George Manas has been named Chief Media Officer of OMD U.S and Anthony Koziarski is taking the same role at PHD USA. Resolution Media will continue as an agency focused on non-network clients that seek dedicated performance-only media services. While we have undertaken numerous organizational changes, our philosophy to support strong brands and cultures so they can be vital incubators for creativity and innovation, as well as magnets for the best talent has not changed. We believe our approach is a significant competitive advantage in retaining and hiring the best people and in servicing our clients.","Our major brands have their own unique positioning and go to market strategies, but a common overarching theme is our commitment to the concept of connected creativity. We're using data, analytics, cultural insights and technology tools from our Omni platform to create and deliver a powerful brand voice that connects with consumer across every touch points, whether it's marketing, sales, service or support and through all mediums. It's important to distinguish that Omni service as a platform of extremely valuable information. Just as important, our agencies continue to significantly invest in educating and training their people, and hiring new talent that can interpret and use this information. This is a fundamental and constant change at our agencies and one which will allow us to remain a key partner for innovation to our clients, especially as the marketplace rapidly evolves.","As evidenced that these key themes and strategies are positively impacting our work, let me just mention a few of the recent highlights of our agencies being recognized around the globe. OMD was named Adweek's 2019 Global Media Agency of the year; in WARC, best of the best rankings, BBDO was ranked the number one network, BBDO New York received number one agency, followed by Adam and Eve, DDB. Omnicom won the world's most awarded holding company.","Ketchum was named best agency of the past 20 years at the 20th annual PRWeek awards. At the 2019 Dubai Lynx Awards, BBDO Worldwide won network of the year with TBWA Worldwide coming in second. The Media Network of the year went to OMD Worldwide. As always, these awards are a true testament to the talent here at Omnicom. We've always strived to be a great place for people to work, which includes creating a safe and inclusive environment for all employees regarding a race, religion, gender or sexuality, part of the commitment to attracting, retaining and developing the best talent, means continuing to place a strong emphasis on our diversity and inclusion efforts.","Indeed, we've made some strides and diversity and inclusion in the first quarter. For the third year in a row, we received 100% on Human Rights Camping in Corporate and Quality Index, the national benchmarking tool on corporate policies and practices pertaining to LGBTQ employees. Omnicom also received distinction of the best place to work for LGBTQ equality. And Omnicom is an official member of the Valuable 500, a global moment putting disability inclusion on the leadership agenda of businesses.","In summary, we've made significant strides in changing our services, capability and organization. We are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, which continue to reflect benefits of our strategies. While it is early in the year, we're on track for where we expect to be for the full year 2019.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the first quarter results. Phil?","Phil Angelastro","Thank you, John and good morning. As John said, our results for the first quarter of 2019 were better than our expectations. While organic revenue growth was within our expected range, our operating profit and margins were stronger than we expected.","Our results were driven by several items, including the strong performance of our agencies, the continuing impact of our cost efficiency initiatives, costs and benefits from the repositioning actions we took in the third quarter of 2018, including a favorable change in business mix in the quarter from the disposition of certain non-strategic underperforming agencies in the second half of 2018. In addition, we recorded a net gain on few smaller dispositions in Q1, which after considering the effect the negative impact FX translation had on our operating profit also had a slightly positive impact on our margins.","Turning on Slide 3. For the first quarter, organic revenue growth totaled 2.5% or $91 million. Additionally, due to the continued strengthening of U.S. dollar since the second half of last year, changes in currency rates negatively impacted our reported revenue by $122 million or 3.4%. And finally, dispositions in connection with our repositioning actions, primarily in our CRM execution and support discipline, exceeded revenue from acquisitions in the quarter as we continue to cycle through the disposals we made in the second half of 2018. The net impact from acquisitions and dispositions reduced our first quarter revenue by $130 million or about 3.6%. In total, our reported revenue decreased 4.4% to $3.5 billion in the quarter. In a few minutes, I will discuss the drivers of the changes in revenue in more detail.","Turning to Slide 1 and the income statement items below revenue. Our Q1 EBITDA was $451 million, up $1 million from Q1 of '18 or three-tenths of a percent with the resulting in margin of 13%, up 60 basis points. Our operating income or EBIT for the quarter was $429 million, up 1.7% when compared to the first quarter of last year. While our operating margin of 12.4% represented an 80 basis point improvement over Q1 of last year.","A few key points in regards to our margin improvement. We continue to seek out opportunities to increase operational efficiencies. These initiatives are primarily focused in the areas of real estate, back office services, procurement and IT and continue to positively impact our operating performance. Additionally, as we described last quarter, we continue to see benefits from the change in business mix, resulting from disposition of several non-strategic lower margin or underperforming agencies. And lastly, during to quarter, we recorded a net gain on the disposition of a few agencies, including MarketStar, a U.S. based sales support business, which after considering the effect of the negative impact of FX translation on our operating profit had a slightly positive impact on our margins.","Net interest expenses for the quarter was $46 million, down $900,000 compared to the first quarter of 2018, and down $7.1 million versus Q4 of 2018. Interest expenses on our debt increased $3.1 million in the first quarter of 2019 versus Q1 of '18. Lightening higher rates on our fixed to floating expense interest rates loss which is partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on commercial paper compared to the prior year. To take advantage of unique opportunity, in February 2019, we issued \u20ac520 million of short-term senior notes at a private placement to investor outside the United States. The notes are unsecured, non-interest bearing and mature on August 2019. As a result, in the first quarter of 2019, we were able to substantially reduce our other short-term borrowing needs, including our commercial paper issuances. The reduction in commercial paper borrowing is expected to continue through the maturity of the notes in Q3.","Interest income increased $1.6 million versus Q1 of 2018, lightening higher cash balances available for investments. And when compared to Q4 of 2018, interest expense on our debt decreased $2.9 million. Due to the decrease in commercial paper activity as described above, interest and amortization expense on our pension obligations also decreased versus last quarter. And lastly, we also saw an increase in our interest income versus Q4.","Regarding income taxes, our reported effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26.8% in line with our expected 2019 full year rate. As a reminder, last year's Q1 tax rate benefited from the successful resolution of foreign tax claims, which reduced last year's quarterly income tax expense by $13.3 million. Earnings from our affiliates was marginally negative in the first quarter of 2019, while the allocation of earnings for the minority shareholders on our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased to $16.5 million due to our disposition activity, as well as the impact of FX. As a result, net income for the first quarter was $263 million, down slightly when compared to our reported Q1 2018 net income. And after excluding the $13.3 million addition to net income from the settlement of the foreign tax claims from last year, 2019's net income would have increased 4.9%.","Now turning to Slide 2. Income available for common shareholders for the quarter was also $263 million and our diluted share count for the quarter decreased 3.1% versus Q1 of last year to $224.2 million. As a result, our diluted EPS for the first quarter was $1.17, which increased $0.03 or 2.6% when compared to our reported Q1 EPS for last year. Positive impact from the settlement of the foreign tax claims increased last year's EPS by $0.06. So excluding this item, the increase versus last year's first quarter would have been $0.09 or 8.3%.","Turning to components of our revenue change in the first quarter, which are detailed on Page 3. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. dollar's continued strengthening created large headwinds in our reported revenue. The impact of changes in currency rates decrease reported revenue by 3.4% or $122 million in revenue for the quarter. And as has been the case for the last two quarters, the strengthening was widespread. On a year-over-year basis in the first quarter, the dollar strengthened against every one of our major foreign currencies. The largest FX movements in the quarter are from the euro, the UK pound, the Australian dollar and the Brazilian real.","Looking forward, currencies stayed where they currently are. FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 2.5% during the second quarter then moderate in the second half of the year, resulting in a negative impact of approximately 25 basis points for the second half and 1.5% for the full year. But obviously, it's difficult to make assumptions on how foreign currency rates will move over the next few months let alone the balance of 2019. The impact of our recent acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by $130 million in the quarter or 3.6%, primarily driven by the Sellbytel disposition and other actions we took in the second half of last year, and a few dispositions we completed in the back half of the first quarter.","Based on transactions we completed to-date and since we will cycle through the most significant of last year's dispositions by end of the third quarter, our current expectations are that the impact of our acquisition activity net of dispositions will continue to be negative; approximately 4% for the second quarter and approximately 3% for the third quarter and for the full year.","Turning to organic growth, which was up $91 million on a global basis for the quarter, or 2.5%. The performance of our disciplines was mixed. Our advertising and healthcare disciplines both had solid organic growth in the quarter. Year end consumer experience was marginally negative due primarily to reductions in revenue at our events businesses, which offset strong performance in our precision marketing agencies in the quarter. And PR was down a bit, while CRM execution and support continued to underperform. Geographically, all regions were positive in the quarter except for Latin America with our domestic and Continental European regions having the strongest performance.","Slide 4 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the first quarter, split was 55% for advertising and 45% for marketing and services. As to their organic growth by discipline, our advertising discipline was up 5.1%. Advertising's organic growth continues to lead by our media businesses, notably the continued strong performance by Hearts and Science. While our global and national advertising agencies performed well with only a few exceptions. CRM consumer experience was down six tenths of a percent for the quarter, primarily driven by declines in our events businesses, which faced the very difficult comp, partly driven by last year's Winter Olympic in South Korea. Results for the rest of the discipline were mostly positive, driven by strong performance from our precision marketing group, branding, which also had growth, while our shopper and sales promotion businesses were down slightly.","While CRM execution and support continued to underperform this quarter. Our domestic businesses while negative versus the prior year did show improvement versus Q4. PR was down five tenths of a percent. Performance in this discipline was also mixed by geographic regions. The UK and Asia were both positive. North America was marginally negative with Continental Europe and Latin America both lagging in the quarter. And Healthcare was up 6.8%. As has been the case over the last past few quarters, growth has been well balanced with positive results across all regions.","On Slide 5, which details the regional mix of business, you can see during the quarter the split was 54% in the U.S., 3% for rest of North America, 10% in the UK, 18% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, 3% for Latin America and the balance for the Middle East and African markets. As for the details of our performance by region, organic revenue growth in the first quarter in U.S. was 2%, led by our advertising and media agencies, as well as our healthcare agencies with mixed performance from our CRM consumer experience agencies, while our CRM execution and support agencies declined.","Our UK businesses were positive again this quarter, up 1.3% and led by our advertising, healthcare and PR agencies. However, the continuing uncertainty surrounding how the British government will formalize its departure from the EU certainly clouds the outlook for the market. The rest of Europe was up 4% organically in the quarter.","In the Euro markets, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, continue to turn in strong performances across disciplines this quarter; Germany returned to positive organic growth, while France lagged; our organic growth in Europe outside the eurozone was positive as well; organic growth in the Asia-Pacific region facing a fairly strong comp to Q1 of 2018 2.1% with Australia, India, Japan and New Zealand, leading the way this quarter; our greater China agencies down organically in total for the quarter, largely from the impact of non-recurring project revenue in Q1 '18 in our events agencies in that market. Latin America was down 3% in the quarter with the continuing issues in the Brazilian economy, dragging down the region's performance overall. Elsewhere in the region, we continue to see positive performance from our agencies in Mexico. The Middle East and Africa, which is our smallest regions, was up 12.8% for the quarter.","On Slide 6, we present our revenue by industry sector. And comparing the first quarter revenue for 2019 to 2018, you can see a slight shift in our mix of business, an increase in the contribution from our former industry clients, offset with a decrease in the percentage of revenue from our technology clients, primarily resulting from the Sellbytel disposition.","Turning to our cash flow performance. On Slide 7, you can see that in the first quarter, we generated $341 million of free cash flow, including changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 8, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $135 million, down slightly versus Q1 last year, is a reduction in our outstanding common shares as a result of repurchase activity over the past year. The $0.05 per share increase in the quarterly dividend that we announced in February will impact our cash payments from Q2 forward.","Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders totaled $17 million. Capital expenditures were $27 million, down compared to 2018 due to less leasehold improvement activity. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled $7 million, reflecting a decrease in activity so far this year when compared to our Q1 activity last year. And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $284 million, reflecting an increase in the activity this year versus last year. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $130 million in the first quarter.","Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt is $5.5 billion, up about $600 million since this time last year and as of this past year end. As we mentioned earlier in February of 2019, we issued short-term senior notes of \u20ac520 million in a private placement to an investor outside the United States. The notes are unsecured, non-interest-bearing and mature this August and therefore are classified as short-term on our balance sheet.","Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.04 billion, up about $800 million compared to year end December 31, 2018 balance. The increase in net debt was a result of the typical uses of working capital and historically occurred in our first quarter which totaled about $740 million, as well as the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $130 million. These increases in net debt were partially offset by the cash we received from our disposition activity of $65 million and the effect of exchange rates on cash during Q1, which increased our cash balance by about $25 million. Compared to March 31, 2018, our net debt is down $282 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the positive change in operating capital during the past 12 months of approximately $340 million and the cash proceeds received from the sale of subsidiaries during the last year of $370 million. Partially offsetting these increases over the past 12 months was the over-spend of our free cash flow of approximately $170 million and the negative impact of FX on our cash balances, which totaled just over $200 million.","As far our debt ratios, they remained solid. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times, reflecting the issuance of euro denominated debt this quarter. While our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio fell to 0.9 times. And due to the year-over-year increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio decreased to 9.8 times but remained strong. And finally on Slide 10, you can see we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio was 25%, while our return on equity was 52.6%.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Just a couple of questions, if I may. John, maybe if you can provide a bit more color on what you are seeing behind the healthy underlying business, especially in U.S., which has seen some improvement the last couple of quarters after lagging for a couple of years. You gave some broader color. But I'm wondering if there is anything specific that's driving improvement in the U.S.? And then maybe for Phil, I think you have highlighted a couple of divestures that you've identified over the last 12 months or so, which has helped improve the profitability of the business. I guess I'm wondering if you could tell us if that's going to help improve the profitability going forward. Should we see some margin benefit the next couple of quarters? And maybe how many more of these underperforming businesses you think you still have that we could see the opportunity of further divestitures?","John Wren","Alexia, in terms of the color or our outperformance this quarter versus same quarters prior years is the marketplace is changing all the time, it's changing in a number of ways. The competition set is pretty much what competition set was. Last year -- at the end of last year, we were able to -- we had a very good run in the third quarter in terms of new business. So we're seeing some of that reflected in the performance of the first quarter, and you will see it throughout the rest of the balance of this year, that's probably the biggest single component. The other thing as you know is organic growth for the net of what to win, how your clients grow or decline and what you lose. And we've been fortunate of late not to have the leaky bucket syndrome. So I'm pretty optimistic.","Phil Angelastro","And then just follow up in terms of divestitures, Alexia. I think for future expectations for the balance of the year and the rest of the quarters, I think our expectation is for the businesses to continue perform well. And I think we would expect to achieve probably 20 to 30 basis points of improvement over the last year. First quarter relatively speaking is traditionally small relative to the rest of quarters. So the first quarter doesn't always necessarily make a definitive trend for us. But we're going to continue to focus on EBITDA as we always do and we would expect 20 to 30 basis points for the balance of the year. But we're also going to continue to invest in the business and invest for growth as we always do and try to find the right balance, so that we can find and fund sustainable growth.","In terms of future divestitures and the process we go through, I think you've seen over the last three or four years that it is a part of the process we follow. I think we're through an awful lot of what we plan to do strategically, but we're going to continue that process. We look at it every quarter and annually every year late in the year as we look at the new year and reevaluate where the businesses still fits strategically and what might be some opportunistic things that come up, which is essentially what you saw with the Sellbytel disposition in the third quarter of last year and then the market saw a disposition in the first quarter of this quarter, both of those were similar businesses, different geographies. But there were opportunities for us to take advantage of situations where we weren't prepared to continue to invest in what was needed for the future of those businesses yet we're able to find buyers that made much more sense than us for those businesses.","Alexia Quadrani","I think, that's was very helpful. Can I just ask you one quick follow up? Could you quantify the gain of MarketStar that you captured in the quarter?","Phil Angelastro","I don't think from our perspective it's significant enough to quantify. I think between MarketStar as we said as far as the gain and the translation loss we had on FX, those two together were essentially less than 10 basis points.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dan Salmon","John, maybe with your comments earlier about the competitive set not changing that much ultimately, the answer to this question maybe, no. But nevertheless, I'd be just interested in your thoughts a bit more high level. But when you look at some of the moves in recent weeks where non-traditional competitors like Accenture has been buying maybe what we viewed as a bit more traditional competitors like Droga or transaction like we saw over the weekend with Publicis and Epsilon. If I put aside everything to talk about disciplines and capabilities and where the future of the business heads, if I put that aside. If I put aside your normal discipline on M&A and valuation in the past and just what deals maybe available. And just try to isolate the variables in your head that line up to say. Does M&A in a mid to larger scale make more sense or less sense based on what's going to on around you? Do you sense any notable change in how you might look at the landscape in that sense?","John Wren","Speaking surely from an Omnicom point of view, we take these apart - as examples in two parts, Accenture buying Droga, which is a very good agency. I already have a lot of really good agencies. So that is not something that we're buying another agency, it wouldn't be of appeal to me. Hiring which we're requiring larger end consultive type of IT practices, not Sapiens of the world, because we think there was big builds of the past, but like Credera, which we did last year and a few others. We will continue to do those but I don't see them to be terribly expensive. And what Epsilon and I don't know what -- I haven't looked at Epsilon in a long time. But from what I've observed of Epsilon, they're a good company. They have some good clients. They don't have anything from what I can observe as unique or self proprietary in terms of what it does that it's if necessary is not replicated. Jonathan Nelson who is head of our -- whole of Omnicom, our Digital Practice is sitting here with us today. Jonathan, do you want to add anything on that?","Jonathan Nelson","At Omnicom, we have been working on this idea of mass personalization and scale for well over a decade. Our investments in Annalect, our platform Omni and the Precision Marketing Group, along with Hearts and Science, are just latest examples of how we're focused on this. As we proceed on this, we are really focused on three key areas. One is to keep the platforms open. As I've previously talked about, we would rather rent and partner on data and technology rather than own. That's not to say that in a few strategic instances, we won't develop our own data assets. We do develop our own data assets like our inventory graph, but we generally believe a modular open approach is best for ourselves and our customers. Two, we have been doing this on a global basis for over a decade.","Our data platform and our technology platforms have been rolled out in every major region of the world as of right now. And three, the hardest part about this is doing integration with your traditional assets at scale. Anybody who does this can tell you that mass personalization at scale is extremely hard and we have been dedicated to training thousands of our employees across all of the world in every major discipline across Omnicom for the entire time that we've been doing this. So those three things open versus close, global and integration at scale are how we're approaching this problem.","John Wren","And the final answer to your question, if I or my team felt threatened in any way, we would look for the appropriate acquisitions to complete our offerings to our clients. I simply don't feel that way right now.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question in queue will come from Adrien De Saint Hilaire with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Adrien De Saint Hilaire","Actually a very easy one, I don't think you really repeated your 2019 outlook for 2% to 3% organic sales growth. So could you just say whether you are still happy with this? Thank you very much.","Phil Angelastro","I don't think there's anything in our view that would change the outlook for the year at this point up 2% to 3% growth for the year.","Adrien De Saint Hilaire ","And also would you mind sharing how much did Accuen grow year-on-year dollar wise Q1 versus Q1?","Phil Angelastro","So actually Accuen grew in the U.S. by about $2 million, so it's basically flat. And on a worldwide basis, Accuen was down $4 million, which also is roughly flat. Going forward, or overall just to comment on the programmatic business. So programmatic business certainly in our view continues to be strong but we continue to see the transition of some clients from our performance based bundled solution to the traditional agency approach and going forward, as John had said earlier, programmatic offerings being integrated into our agencies and into the agency offerings. So we think that's the right answer for the business ultimately, because it is something that is just part of what our agencies do on a day-to-day basis. But ultimately, the business is strong and continues to perform well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Julien Roch with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julien Roch","My strategy question I admit has been asked, so I will do a more simple number question. For Phil, if FX is minus 100 basis point across the board, i. e. not a big impact from one country to another. What's the rough impact on margin, that's my first question? The second one is for a while you said that you've done the bulk of dispositions but you're looking at the portfolio on a continuing basis and you've increased the guidance from 2.5 to 3. Going forward in 2021, what's the best way of thinking about acquisition less disposition, put a flat number or put like a minus one number, because you will continue to trim the portfolio? And then, last question is interest guidance for the full year, because of the benefit of the projects until August? Thank you.","Phil Angelastro","So on FX, I think your question is a hypothetical one. If FX was down a 100 basis point what would the impact on margin be, I think the answer is it depends on where the FX positive or in this case a negative would be. But I think it's pretty direct to say if FX is up or down 100 basis points to 200 basis points, typically the impact on our margins is minimal. And in this quarter the impact that negative FX had on margins, the margin percentage was less than 10 basis points, which sometimes when FX is up or down in the neighborhood of was this quarter. We do tend to see a larger impact on our margins, on the margin percentage but that didn't happened this quarter, the FX decline was not across the board, didn't have a big impact on margin percentage when you looked at the totality of Omnicom.","As far as dispositions go, we don't forecast certainly into 2020 and 2021. I think the bulk of the dispositions we have done to date, we will cycle through by the end of Q3 of this year. The size of the dispositions we did this quarter just are not that large that they're going to have a significant impact on the number going forward. And as far as strategically, we'll continue to pursue the same strategy as far as acquisitions are concerned. We'd rather do more than less. Our capital allocation strategies are going to change to the extent that we can find accretive acquisitions that fit our strategy fit the culture, and meet the needs of what we think we work well and integrate with the business. We're going to try and find more of those deals and do more of those deals. We're not going to set an acquisition dollar target and then have an M&A group chase deals so that we can meet that target. But we're going to continue to pursue deals. We're pursuing them today but less of the right fit, we're pretty disciplined about if we are going to continue to be disciplined about it.","So, ideally, as we get out a year or two, the goal would be to have certainly back in the more acquisitions mode. The disposition process will continue but certainly the bulk of what we intended to do -- we're through the bulk of it but we're going to continue to look at opportunistic things as they come up and if they're right for the business disposition might be the right answer but the goal is to do more acquisitions certainly. On interest expense, I think we don't have -- I don't have the number in front of me. We could take that offline. But we certainly expect that the reductions that we've been able to achieve in our fee borrowings, because of the opportunistic debt offering we did, private placement we did in January or in early February, is going to reduce our CP borrowings. And we'll probably have a little bit of negative year-over-year increase in interest from our floating -- our fixed floating swaps. But we do have a debt offering coming. We do have a 10 year bond offering that's coming due that we're going to replace and there should be some savings from that offering, because 10 years ago the rate was certainly higher than we expect to refinance today. So we can take that offline and we can give you some more detail.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Michael Nathanson with Moffett Nathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael Nathanson","Can I just ask one on the numbers and then one if I could to Jonathan? So just on the numbers, when I look at salary and service change, I know there is a lot of moving pieces from dispositions and currency. Is there any way you can give me a sense of what was -- what do you think your organic growth is for Omnicom on salary and services? How do we think about it for the year? Just try to strip away all these moving pieces.","John Wren","I don't know if Phil can but I know I can. We don't really look at it that way or attempt to look at it that way unfortunately in terms of having a specific answer for your question.","Michael Nathanson","Okay, and then I guess question B is, so also you guys within that number, you can't take out what currency would be. Do you think currency is representative of -- the change in currencies represent the change in salary and service, is there anything unusual about maybe the weighting of salary and service by geographies?","Phil Angelastro","No, I don't think there is anything unusual. We actually -- I don\u2019t have it with me for the call. But we do have a constant currency calculation that we do. So we can give you a follow up what those ratios were on a constant currency basis so that you get a sense for what those numbers are without currency. We typically have that I forget to bring it with me into the room where we're having the call.","Michael Nathanson","And do you guys mind if I ask Jonathan a question. Jonathan, a question for you is last year we spent a lot of time in beginning year thinking about GDPR and the impact on the market and on agencies. I wonder when you look back on what happened last year in GDPR. What did you learned? And looking forward, what's happened within the U.S. what do think is likely turns a privacy outcomes here for the U.S.?","Jonathan Nelson","Well, I think that there will be more regulation around privacy in U.S. that\u2019s nearly inevitable with the comments made by a number of people in the industry legislation is going to happen in the U.S. At Omnicom, we did a deep audit of all of our assets looking at all of our different data providers and partners and came up with policies and procedures to protect ourselves and our clients. And what we're trying to do is find that fuzzy line of privacy and take a few steps back from it. And I think that policy has worked so far and it will likely work going forward.","Michael Nathanson","And you didn\u2019t see any material change in how you guys run your business because of it?","Jonathan Nelson","Not a material change. I mean when it comes down to actually on a day-to-day basis, of course it's evolving everyday but in the macro it keeps moving forward.","John Wren","I think we have time -- given the markets are about to open, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","John Wren","Okay, if not, we're right on time. So thank you everybody for joining the call. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude you conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&T's executive teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"16179":["Omnicom Group (NYSE:OMC) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 15, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Randall J.

Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Omnicom Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to now introduce to you today's conference call host, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Omnicom Group, Mr. Randall Weisenburger. Please go ahead.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our third quarter 2013 earnings call. We hope everyone's had a chance to review our earnings release. We have posted to our website both the press release and the presentation covering the information that we'll be presenting this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I've been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that's included at the end of our investor presentation and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially.","I'd also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we'll discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our performance. And due to the pending merger with Publicis, we'll be giving a few more non-GAAP measures than we have in the past. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.","John is going to begin the call with some brief remarks about the quarter, as well as the status report and overview of our pending merger with Publicis. Following John's remarks, I'll review our financial performance for the quarter in more detail. And then both John and I will be happy to take questions.","John D. Wren","Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call. We're now 3 quarters through 2013, and I'm pleased to say our performance for the quarter and for the year-to-date remains strong. I'm going to start with comments on the quarter and then a brief update on the proposed Publicis Omnicom Group merger. Please bear in mind that our groups are operating independently as we go through the required approval process.","For the third quarter, organic growth was over 4.1%, and operating income and margin, excluding merger-related expenses, improved over the same period of 2012. On a regional basis, our performance reflects some broader macroeconomic conditions in the global market. We continue to experience strong organic growth in the U.S. and the U.K. The Eurozone has not yet returned to growth, and our businesses in both Latin America and Asia performed well during the quarter. While we are cautiously optimistic about economic conditions, we remain focused on the things we can control.","Our results are an affirmation of the success of Omnicom's strategic priorities to drive growth: first, to invest in and retain the best talent; next, to expand our global footprint, particularly in developing markets and move into new fast-growing service areas; third, to invest in our digital and analytical capabilities and assets around the globe; and fourth, to deliver innovation and integrated solutions using meaningful consumer insights across disciplines for the benefit of our clients. We are confident that our pending merger with Publicis will only enhance the strength in these core strategies. It'll bring a wider pool of talent, a broader portfolio of best-in-class agencies and a deeper set of systems-integration capabilities.","Since we made the announcement, I have visited with many of our employees and clients. There is an air of excitement about the merger and a clear sense of opportunities it creates. For our employees, many of whom are listening to this call this morning, this merger means working for the best companies in the industry. Maurice and I and our leadership teams are committed to excellence. Creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship have always been and will continue to be priorities for our agencies. And while we share many core values, we also want our networks and agencies to have distinct, unique identities in the marketplace.","Our merger will give Omnicom and Publicis employees higher ceilings as there is no group that can possibly offer better career prospects. It will also give employees greater access to talent development programs that lead the industry. Omnicom University is just one example of a leadership program that we will extend to our colleagues at Publicis, and I'm certain Omnicom employees will also reap similar benefits from their talent development programs. As a result, our employees will have access to better training and increased opportunities for self-development.","For our clients, as our firms come together, Publicis Omnicom will continue to deliver the work and service they are used to from people who are focused on delivering the very best. There are no plans to merge individual agency brands. We are in the talent business, and people want to work for a company that stands for something. Having an agency that has its own unique identity and culture is very important. What will change and dramatically improve, however, is access to a more diverse portfolio of services, our global reach, as well as a deeper bench strength of digital and creative talent. Together, we will be able to serve our clients with exceptional expertise, collaboration and creativity in an ever-changing environment across a full spectrum of disciplines and geographies at scale.","As all of you know, the pace of change is staggering. This rapid shift has created a new world of extraordinary opportunities. New technologies are changing our personal and business lives and generating vast amounts of data that we can draw insight from. We are now able to segment our target audiences even more meaningfully and reach them even more precisely, in the right place, at the right time and when they're in the right mood. We can convey messages that are capitally nuanced based on insights, derived, in part, from the effective analysis of data.","To realize the true value of this for our clients, Publicis Omnicom will capitalize on our own technology platforms and work effectively with an increasing number of technology partners. Towards this end, there are advantages of scale. Publicis and Omnicom can leverage platforms and the investments necessary to develop and maintain them across a much bigger operation. And when partnering with technology companies, we will be able to extend our relationship across a larger group of agencies.","A good example of this strategy is Omnicom's investment in Annalect, our primary data and analytical business. Today, Annalect has hundreds of data scientists and programmers, who are working with many of our agencies across disciplines and platforms, collecting data, which is used to develop actionable insights in real time. These efforts are driving a tangible shift in how our agencies are hiring and developing their talent to ensure that they can use the data effectively to create, target and distribute content across multiple platforms.","As an example of this trend, one of our CRM agencies, RAPP, recently named its first director of applied data, a role that will serve the purpose of deriving insights and actions from our data platforms. However, big ideas and creativity will not be replaced by algorithms anytime soon. Clients are looking for ideas and execution that transcend and work across all mediums. This means cutting a 30-second commercial for the Super Bowl or placing an ad on Facebook or a 6-second video on buying[ph], a live event or any number of options.","Publicis and Omnicom have the combination of both mad men and math men, who are going to be required to win in the future. As our clients succeed in this landscape, so, too, do our shareholders. Investors in Omnicom and Publicis will benefit from 2 very strong publicly-traded companies coming together. In fact, Publicis and Omnicom have the strongest track records of financial performance in the industry. We fully expect this to continue after the merger, with strong cash flow generations for the shareholders. Today, we each have strong balance sheets, and we each have the ability to invest internally in our growth and make acquisitions as they arise.","Together, our ability, reach and flexibility grows even stronger. The proposed merger is the combination of the 2 best-managed holding companies in the industry, and the reaction from our employees and clients has been very positive. So there is no doubt in my mind that the creation of Publicis Omnicom Group is the right move, providing best-in-class marketing and communication services that will support our clients, develop and attract the best talent and enable shareholders to continue to invest with confidence in an even stronger communications enterprise.","With respect to the merger approval process, it's moving forward as expected. The process of seeking regulatory approval is now well underway in 16 jurisdictions, covering 46 countries. Given the number of jurisdictions involved, it's difficult to predict the exact timing of regulatory clearance, but at this point, it is going well. In preparation for joining together, the companies have agreed on an integration approach, and our senior management will be meeting later this month to begin the early stages of determining what the Day 1 business requirements and long-term opportunities for the combined company will be. There is still much to accomplish, but at this moment, we're on track for closing the deal in early 2014. It is also important to reiterate, until the transaction is complete, Omnicom and Publicis will continue to operate as 2 distinct companies.","Before turning the call over to Randy, who will go into greater detail on the financials, I'd like to make a few more comments on the business highlights for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Omnicom places emphasis on education and training as a key to success. Last quarter, we completed Omnicom University's Advanced Management Program at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. In partnership with Fudan University, we also held a Digital Work session. These sessions demonstrate our commitment to training as a company and to building our skills in Greater China. Ask anyone who's been through these programs around the world and you are likely to get the same answer: these are unique experiences to tackle important client and agency challenges. They help create stronger leaders, better teams and ultimately, a better product.","In September, Omnicom advanced its reputation for creativity and innovation with another great showing at Spikes, which is considered the Cannes of Asia. For the fifth consecutive year, BBDO and DDB were among the top 3 networks recognized for creativity. Over[ph] 35 agencies in 10 countries contributed to Omnicom winning more than 100 creative awards at Spikes. Many of the winning Spikes entries were the result of our agencies working together and collaborating on behalf of their clients behind the scenes.","In fact, for a growing number of our clients, our people are collaborating across disciplines and agencies more closely than ever. They are sharing insights and ideas and increasingly working together to achieve common objectives for our clients. Sometimes these teams are informal and organic, while, at other times, they are more structured and centralized. As a client-focused organization, we realize it's not a one-size-fits-all approach to servicing our clients, but, rather, understanding their unique business challenge and developing creative solutions.","A good example is the recent announcement of our partnership with Nissan Motor Company. Together, we signed a multiyear agreement for communications, advertising, marketing, media, promotions and digital services. Our success is the result of our team's ability to present benefits of integration from both a strategic and execution perspective and demonstrate the power of this model to the benefit of our client. This relationship will be managed by Nissan United. The team will include numerous Omnicom agencies, such as TBWA, OMD, Interbrand, Emanate and others. This is a unique structure for Nissan as they look to build a consistent brand promise across the globe.","Collaboration and coordination across our agencies is even more important today than ever before. You may have seen in the press that we recently appointed Troy Ruhanen, a top executive from BBDO, to a new position at Omnicom to help drive cross-agency collaboration and innovation for many of our largest clients. Troy is a builder of bridges across agencies and offices, and his global experience make him well suited for the challenge.","It has been an exciting 9 months for Omnicom, with solid financial results. Our goal now is a strong finish to the year and an on-schedule closing of our merger with Publicis next year. With that said I'll turn the call over to Randy for more details on the third quarter.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Thank you, John. It has certainly been an eventful quarter with the announcement of the merger and all of the activities that it's involved. That said, I wouldn't want the upcoming merger to distract from the excellent performance Omnicom's agencies had this quarter and through the first 9 months of this year.","To make our financial presentation easier to follow, we've added a third column of numbers labeled Non-GAAP. This column excludes the incremental costs we've incurred in the third quarter related to the merger. These costs, which are predominantly professional fees, totaled $28.1 million and net of taxes, reduced EPS by $0.08 per share. As you all know, we do not typically present non-GAAP results, but in this case, we think it will help to evaluate the relative performance of our operations. For the presentation, I will focus my comments on the Non-GAAP column, but we have the reported GAAP numbers side by side for easy reference and clarity. Again, the only difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP results are the exclusion of the merger-related costs and then the follow-on effects on taxes and obviously, the summary numbers, like net income and EPS.","So moving on. On the revenue front, as John said, our agencies are continuing to have a good year despite the relatively weak economic environment. In the third quarter, revenue came in at just under $3.5 billion. Total growth was approximately 2.5%, while organic growth was 4.1%. FX headwinds and net dispositions brought the growth rate down by 1.6%. I'll address our revenue growth in more detail in a few slides. From an earnings perspective, our agencies had another excellent quarter. The ongoing initiatives that focus on efficiency improvements and streamlining our portfolio, combined with our individual agency's intense focus on cost control, resulted in EBITA increasing 4.5% to $433 million. The resulting EBITA margin was 12.4%, which was up almost 25 basis points over last year. Operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased 5.2% to $408 million, and margins increased just over 30 basis points to 11.7%.","Looking at the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $42.8 million, up $2.5 million from the third quarter of last year and up $2.1 million sequentially from the second quarter of this year. This increase is due to the accrual of contingent interest on a remaining convertible bond. During the measurement period in the quarter, the stock price crossed the threshold requiring us to pay contingent interest on the bond, and in accordance with GAAP, we accrued the potential interest to be paid through the next call date, which is July of 2014. On the tax front, our operating tax rate for the quarter was 33.6%, which is in line with our expectations for the full year. The reported rate was somewhat higher at 34.5% because certain of the merger-related costs are capitalized and nondeductible for tax purposes.","Looking at income from our affiliates and income allocated to our minority shareholders. There were numerous ups and downs from a year ago, as well as currency variances in the quarter, with the aggregate effect being no change year-over-year. As a result of all of that, our total non-GAAP net income increased 6.8% to $218 million and net income available for our common shareholders increased by 6.5% to $212 million. The GAAP net income figures, which include the merger-related costs, was $196 million and $191 million, respectively.","On Slide 3, we compute EPS. First, as a result of stock repurchases we've made over the past 12 months, our diluted share count was down about 8.6 million shares or about 3.2% to just under 260 million shares. As a result, our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.82, representing an increase of 10.8%. As I mentioned earlier, the costs through the third quarter related to the merger reduced GAAP EPS by about $0.08, down to $0.74 per share, which was flat compared to 2012.","On slides 4, 5 and 6, we present the summary P&L and EPS information for the year-to-date period, but I'm going to leave those pages for you to read. On Slide 7, we take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to foreign exchange, on a year-over-year basis, the U.S. dollar strengthened against most of our major currencies in the quarter, except the euro and the Chinese yuan. The net result reduced revenue in the quarter by $21.7 million or about 0.6%. As a reminder, the majority of our costs are incurred in the same currency as our revenues. As a result, the FX impact on our revenue flows pro rata through to our earnings, thus having a negligible effect on our operating margins. Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are currently, we expect foreign exchange to be negative between 50 and 75 basis points in the fourth quarter.","Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, decreased revenue by $34.2 million in the quarter or about 1%. As we mentioned in July, we completed the sale of our recruitment marketing business in the second quarter, so the net decrease was in line with our projections.","In terms of organic growth, we had a very good quarter. The growth rate accelerated to 4.1%, adding $140 million in absolute terms. This increase was driven by continuing very strong performance from our media businesses, especially in the United States and in Asia, further acceleration in our specialty health care businesses and the pharma sector overall. Another quarter of strong performance from our leading PR brands and then, geographically, good performance overall in U.S., the U.K. and Russia, as well as the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America.","Turning to our mix of business on Slide 8. Brand advertising accounted for 47% of our revenue, and marketing services contributed 53%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising's organic growth was 4.8%, driven by the strong performance of our media businesses, offsetting a few larger client losses in advertising earlier in the year. Marketing services in aggregate was up 3.5%. And within marketing services, CRM was up 2.3%, primarily driven by increases in our field marketing and branding businesses; and continuing strong performance in public relations posted organic growth of 4.6%; and specialty communications increased 8.3%, again, primarily driven by the strong performance of our specialty health care businesses.","On Slide 9, our geographic mix of business in the quarter was split 52% domestic and 48% international. Turning to Slide 10. In the United States, revenue increased $57 million or 3.2%. Organic growth was very strong, up 5% or $88 million. Again, media continued to lead our domestic growth, with most of our other disciplines and industries contributing positively as well. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, decreased revenue by $31 million or 1.8%. Again, this was driven primarily by the sale of our recruitment marketing business in the second quarter.","International revenue increased $26.5 million or 1.6%. FX created a headwind causing a revenue decline of $22 million. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, decreased revenue by $3 million or about 0.2%, again related to the recruitment marketing business that we sold. And organic growth, which continues to improve although slowly and with quite a bit of variance by region, was positive at 3.1% adding $51 million.","In our larger European markets, consistent with our performance in Q2, Russia and the U.K. continued to perform very well, while Germany and France were down. Although the Eurozone markets in aggregate were down 1.6% organically in the quarter, it was an improvement from the second quarter. In Asia Pacific, we had strong performances across most of the region, with very strong results in South Korea, Singapore, China, India, New Zealand and Vietnam. And the Middle East and Latin America turned in solid organic results as well.","We've also provided 2 additional slides, slides 11 and 12, that present our geographic revenue by regional subsets: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Africa and Middle East. It's obviously the same information, just organized differently, so I'll leave those for you to read. Slide 13 shows our mix of business by industry. As you can see, there were very slight changes in our mix of business year-over-year. In the quarter, we had good results in food and beverage; consumer products; pharma, as I mentioned before; retail and telecom.","Turning to Slide 14. Our cash performance for the first 9 months of the year was outstanding. We generated a little over $1 billion of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. On Slide 15, the breakdown of our primary uses of cash for the 9 months included dividends to common shareholders of about $212 million. The year-over-year decrease reflected the acceleration of our normal early January dividend payment to December 31 of last year, and that was offset by our increase in the dividends paid per share. Dividends paid to minority interest shareholders were $81 million, and capital expenditures were $123 million.","CapEx was down from last year, when we had several large office space build-outs. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments, net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $89 million, and share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under employee share plans, totaled $492 million. As I believe most of you already know, we have suspended our stock repurchase activity since the announcement of the merger. So on a net basis, for the 9 months, our uses of cash effectively equaled the cash generated in the business.","Slide 16 shows our current capital structure. As you may recall, we redeemed $407 million of our convertible notes during the second quarter. As a result, our total debt at September 30 declined to just over $4 billion. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter increased slightly, up $30 million from a year ago to $2.52 billion. As a result, our total-debt-to-EBITDA ratio decreased to 1.9x, while our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 1.2x. It stayed unchanged from this point last year. And our interest coverage ratio is 10.6x. Obviously, all the metrics are in good shape.","And finally, on Slide 17, both our return on invested capital and our return on equity have continued to improve. For the past 12 months, our return on invested capital was 16.7% and our return on equity was just short of 30%. Well, that concludes our prepared remarks. There are several other supplemental slides included in the presentation materials that we'll leave for your review.","And at this point, I'm going to ask the operator to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","When you initially announced the transaction, there was a bit of concern about potential account losses or client conflicts. Now that you're a couple of months in, what have you heard from clients? And does the risk appear to be somewhat maybe more modest than other deals of size you've seen in the past?","John D. Wren","We have -- we've seen no difficulties thus far. There -- we've been in the business for a long time, and each one of the holding companies has long had the procedures and firewalls to deal with conflicts. If issues arise in the future, we'll deal with it. But to date, we're in good shape.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, good. And then maybe one other quick one. The euro currency markets, obviously, as you mentioned, improved to levels we haven't seen in a few quarters. I know you've talked about some moving pieces in those markets in the past, but is it your sense that you're moving off of the bottom across the entire region?","Randall J. Weisenburger","No. I think we might be stabilizing near the bottom. We had good performance in a couple markets where we have businesses that are growing not necessarily because of the individual markets, that's in Spain and Portugal. But Germany and France, Belgium, those markets in[ph] Netherlands, they were all negative.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. I guess, first, you saw some real nice growth in the U.S., improvement in the U.S. in the quarter and continued strength in the U.K. I guess, any color you can give in terms of how we should view those sort of important markets going into the fourth quarter? Will the trend continue, I guess?","John D. Wren","It's hard to say. I think it's down to the individual performance of our agencies, not necessarily economic growths. And you have to remember that this year, the fourth quarter, the retail schedule is shorter than in the past because of the late Thanksgiving.","Randall J. Weisenburger","The next quarter is also -- as you know, like the fourth quarter every year, we've been talking about it for years now, with sort of year-end project revenues, is always a little bit more difficult to forecast.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then also, I guess, my second question is, you've got obviously, a very strong balance sheet and very healthy cash flow, and now with the buyback suspended due to the pending merger, I think you'll have even a stronger cash position whenever sort of this deal -- when this deal gets done and when you're allowed to sort of step back into the market. Could you give us an update, I guess, on your priorities of use of cash maybe longer term? Can we expect a more accelerated buyback potentially, once you get the green light? I guess any comments on that front would be great.","John D. Wren","Well, as we sit here today from the Omnicom side of the table, our intention is to follow pretty similar -- follow what we've done in the past. When the new company [ph] comes into existence, there'll be a new Board of Directors, and we'll have to sit down with the Board of Directors and -- Maurice and myself, and determine what that board will authorize. So I think it's a little premature to be talking about accelerations or changes from our past behavior.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, thank you for the color you guys gave in terms of where you are on the merger and the outlook there. From the outside -- for us that are sitting on the outside, is there something we can look at in terms of a benchmark or points that we can see that's saying now progress has been made or these hurdles have sort of been overcome? I guess, I don't know if there's any answer to that question, but I thought I'd ask.","Randall J. Weisenburger","On the deal, there's -- I assume you're talking from a transaction perspective.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, yes.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Okay. So there's really sort of 4 gating items. There's the antitrust track. So at this point in time, as John pointed out, we've done our filings or at least the preliminary filings. And I think every jurisdiction -- maybe some small markets, some place we haven't gotten done quite yet, but every major jurisdiction, we've got the filings in, and we're in really sort of the information stage. We're answering questions, following up and people are evaluating it, so we don't have any news really one way or the other. It's progressing on a very good track. People spent a huge amount of time and effort getting those filings done. We did get clearance in South Korea and -- okay.","John D. Wren","Michael?","Michael O'Brien","Yes. This is Mike O'Brien, General Counsel. We've received clearance actually in South Korea, and also in South Africa, we just found out yesterday. So we have had a couple of minor victories there, if you will. And everything else that Randy described is the best way to describe it, it's in process. We're comfortable with the way things have gone so far and the conversations we've had so far, and we're optimistic, but it's still in process.","Randall J. Weisenburger","The second track is taxes. There's 3 jurisdictions that we need to get tax approvals on, and we're in process of doing that, again still early. And then there's the SEC and AMF or AFM filings, and again, that's -- we're also in process on. It's hard to determine which one of those will be the specific gating item at the end, but I think everything is proceeding as we would have expected.","John D. Wren","And as we clear major hurdles, as we go through this, we'll inform the public.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","A couple of things, please. First, just one question on the numbers. You've had some dispositions taking away from numbers a little bit in the last couple of quarters. Just wondering when we'll be cycling through that. And also, I may have remembered this wrong, but I think, as I recall, some of those dispositions actually were profitable. So my question is, would your margin have actually been a bit better had you not gotten rid of those assets during the quarter? And then secondly, on the merger again, I hear your comments and I understand what you're saying about not shutting down agencies and this is about size and scale. I'm wondering in particular about your digital businesses, though. How will you treat your data and digital operations between Publicis and Omnicom? Is it a question of merging databases? Is it a question of putting teams into larger organizations? It just seems like there's so much opportunity to gain scale, but if you intend to keep things separate, I just wonder how you plan to run it.","John D. Wren","Those -- you're talking about the various platforms that we invest in?","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Yes.","John D. Wren","As opposed to the agencies -- and when I say agencies, I mean the networks and the companies. There's an integration process that Maurice and I and our management teams have agreed to, and so we're going to valuably use the time that it takes us to get through all these regulatory issues to sit and plan what is the most sensible, profitable thing to do and what the priority in which we should act once we're allowed to act, after the deal is approved. So that process is just about to begin. And intuitively, I know exactly what you're saying. We will go through it in detail with the people who are the experts in it and make that determination in the coming weeks and months.","Randall J. Weisenburger","As far as your divestitures questions go, the biggest single divestiture we did we completed pretty much at the end of the second quarter, so that's going to take us 4 quarters to cycle on that. It was roughly $35 million a quarter of revenue, probably a little bit of variance quarter-to-quarter. And as far as the margins go, no, those companies -- if we had those companies in the portfolio, our margins would not have been higher. Those companies that we've divested, its margins, are less than Omnicom's average margin.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","A few questions, please. Each quarter, you generally will give us what your net new business wins were in the quarter. I think your quarterly target is generally about $1 billion. How did that track this last quarter, please?","Randall J. Weisenburger","It's a little bit under $900 million.","Craig Huber","Okay. Then, secondly, can you talk a little bit further about your very strong U.K. performance? Why was it so strong, please?","John D. Wren","Again, it's specific agency performance.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Specific agency performance.","John D. Wren","Really, just people in the right place at the right time and winning a few pieces of business.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes.","Craig Huber","So there's no...","Randall J. Weisenburger","Those agencies there in particular had a very good run.","Craig Huber","Okay. Because I remember last quarter, the second quarter, you guys mentioned that there's a large French account that shifted, I guess, from France to London. That helped this quarter as well or no?","John D. Wren","It probably added to the overall performance between the 2 countries, but it's not the sole reason for it.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes. It wasn't the major -- it was -- again, the revenue moved, but it was not a major driver in the quarter.","Craig Huber","And then also, concerning your merger, I wanted to ask if you could just give us further clarity or further update here on that $500 million cost savings target. Can you just maybe give us a little more clarity on what's behind that number in terms of how confident are you that you can get the $500 million number and what's the big nuggets to get to that $500 million cost savings? I think you've talked about getting there by Year 5.","John D. Wren","Yes. I believe the $500 million number we used is modest and comes from a variety of just natural things that you would expect when 2 groups this size come together. We, together, spend over $4 billion in third-party services and other type of costs, and we should gain quite a bit of efficiency in having a common insurance platform to be able to utilize what little excess rent occurs in any particular city at any particular time. Our auditors shouldn't cost as much as they do individually. There's a whole series of things buried in that, that are just natural. There's hard work and -- there's some work and planning in getting to those results, but sometimes, you have to wait until your current policies have lapsed before you can move to the next level. So it's not all Day 1. But there's a great deal of that cost that's buried in that number itself.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes. We went through when we were developing, I'll say, the potential efficiencies on that level. We started at our billings numbers and worked our way down looking at our P&Ls sort of line by line. As John pointed out, there's over $4 billion of third-party costs. There is $15 billion or $14 billion of salary and service costs. We have a number of ideas of how we can get efficiencies across the board. Obviously, each company has a lot of their own best practices. We're going to evaluate each company's best practices and move towards them. I think everybody is pretty confident that there's -- the $500 million worth of efficiencies is a pretty conservative number.","Craig Huber","And then lastly, if I could ask, you've mentioned in the past you have to spend, you think, $400 million over, I think 5, years to achieve these synergies. Is that still your -- the correct number, you think?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I don't think we have any better data than we had when we first put it out. As John also pointed out, due to the process that we're in, the 2 companies have to continue to operate separately and can share limited amounts of data and information. So we're -- frankly, as far as identifying specifics, we're not allowed further than we were, I'll say, pre-deal announcement.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Matt Chesler with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A quick first question on business trends. So you came in at 4.1% organic growth for the quarter. Can you comment at all on any major variances versus your expectations for that by geography or discipline?","John D. Wren","Just really repeating what Randy said on the call. The U.S., we were fortunate. We certainly grew faster than the economy, and that's due to specific performance of specific agencies. And I'd say the same is pretty much true in the U.K.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes. And some standout areas, our media companies have been -- frankly, for a few quarters at least, have been doing a great job. I think that's predominantly driven by their performance, just good business practices at this point, good new business wins. The pharma and health care area is rebounding pretty well also.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then based on September, are those statements as true based on how September came in, which I understand is generally a large marketing month for the industry?","John D. Wren","Yes. I mean, we don't -- September was good first, no question. We don't dissect this analysis down to that microscopic level.","Randall J. Weisenburger","We're the first guys to tell you that we even think the quarter-to-quarter analysis has flaws, if you're trying to draw conclusions at this level of granularity. When you get month-to-month, you're really trying to -- you're trying to find something that's really not there.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then just can you just comment a little bit on some of the emerging markets, just in general terms, what you're seeing going on in markets such as China and Latin America and just maybe emerging markets in general?","John D. Wren","Our performance continues to be strong. Those markets aren't growing this past 6 months in the same way that they were growing 2 years ago. But there's still good growth and there's still plenty of opportunity because there's a lot of share opportunity in those markets for us.","Randall J. Weisenburger","And they're extremely impactful because they've gotten bigger as well. So while the maybe growth percentage numbers were bigger a couple of years ago, when I look at the rank order of who's adding dollars of organic growth, because that's, ultimately, what counts, China and Russia are in the top 4 or top 5. That's impressive to me. The U.S. is always the most important market because of the size, as well as combining it with 5% growth, so certainly not an emerging market, but an extremely important growth market.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Randy finally, so you're not buying back shares currently. Are there any prospects that you may be able to buy back shares at all before the merger closes? Or should we just presume that you're out of the market until it does?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Prospects, yes.","John D. Wren","I think you have to presume that we're out of the market until the merger closes because that's, right now, what our agreement says.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I have 2. First, on the merger costs. I was wondering if you can give any color as to how much you expect to incur prior to the closure, if any costs are coming out of the normal operating expenses. But just any extra color on how you expect that to proceed. And a separate question, I was just curious, production decouplings kind of, I think, a fascinating new space. We've seen Publicis just announce Prodigious. I'm curious how much interest you're seeing from clients on the topic and how you expect that to play out going forward.","John D. Wren","There's a couple of questions there. We have -- we're in the process actually of sitting down with our production companies to see -- because we are global, we're not yet globally branded or managed globally, I suspect that will occur in the coming months as we've seen the benefits of it. Clients are, in fact, pitching or requesting bids on larger areas of its production. They used to be done more regionally. Now they're getting outside of regions. So that's an opportunity for us before we close, and then, certainly, it will be an opportunity post closing for us. With respect to merger-related costs...","Randall J. Weisenburger","I didn't actually get the question, if you'd repeat it.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Sure. I was curious if you have a sense of how many -- what your costs will be through the remainder of the merger process. And are all those costs associated with the transaction incremental? In other words, are there any costs that you're normally incurring that are incorporated in those costs?","Randall J. Weisenburger","The answer to the second part is no. The answer to the first part, unfortunately, I don't have -- a great estimate, it's a lot. A lot of attorneys running around nonstop. This is a fairly large and complex transaction, as we mentioned, on just the antitrust alone. We did economic studies on something like 47 different markets. So I suspect the transaction fees will be at least 1.5, 2x what we've already spent, I would think.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. And just a follow-up on the production decoupling topic, if I may. I'm curious if you have a point of view on the net economics of it. In other words, the notion of a standalone production decoupling business, is it a higher-return-on-capital business? Is it a lower one but it's something clients just increasingly want? I'm curious on your thoughts on the economics of that trend.","John D. Wren","Well, we actually have 3 at the moment, 3 standalone businesses, which are really serving different regions of the world. We're looking to see whether or not we should be expanding that and combining to respond to pitches. And I suspect when we're done with that evaluation, the answer is probably going to be yes. It's good business. It's a growing business. I don't quite understand where you're going with the economics of it.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Well, I guess, what we've heard from the procurement trade, certainly, is the substantial savings that comes out of the creative agency fees paid. Although it's possible that the savings that come out of what they're spending, you recoup with a higher-margin business essentially. I'm just curious if that's something that is accurate, if -- or if it's not at all.","Randall J. Weisenburger","There's -- we even -- we joke internally, production is a fat word. Production means a lot of different things because we have a breadth. Whether it's print production or creating digital websites or doing banner ads or doing TV commercials, doing postproduction, there's a lot of different aspects to production. So when you're saying creating -- when we talk about creating a production unit, we've basically been globalizing and creating 3 separate production companies for the last several years.","John D. Wren","Correct.","Randall J. Weisenburger","There are also a number of other production capabilities we have internally, and we also manage a very large amount of third-party production. I think it's well over $4 billion or $5 billion. So in looking at that whole space, it's a very interesting business. It's a business where we're managing a lot of client spend, and we're doing a lot of different pieces of the work, so we think there's a very significant opportunity bringing those businesses together and focusing on it in a more aggregated global way going forward.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just going back to Europe for a second. I was struck by your comment on Germany still being down. I mean there have been some economic indicators saying that market is starting to turn. Are you seeing any hope there near-term?","John D. Wren","It was down slightly for us in the quarter, yes. Post elections, confidence is there again, but we haven't seen signs of -- tangible signs of it really coming back in the manner that it was -- it performed in the past. But it has stabilized, as Randy said. And so we're cautiously optimistic that at the center of Europe, coming back at all is going to be Germany's performance, and we're optimistic that we'll see it.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Just to make sure we're consistent. Don't read too much into 1 quarter's set of numbers, especially when you cut it up by 1 country at a time. Our numbers are our numbers. New business activity, wins or losses, individual performance of our clients in that country, year-over-year timing and the economy affect the number. A lot of people read those numbers, they hear the number and think it's just a straight indication of the economy, economics in that specific market in the quarter and are also, generally, thinking of that sequentially from last quarter. The numbers we're presenting are year-over-year numbers and they had a lot of different things in that mix, so...","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of James Dix with Wedbush Securities.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Randy, I will make it a 2-parter then. Hopefully, I don't make it too long a 2-parter. How have you been explaining to clients the potential for better service and\/or pricing in the media buying and planning businesses as a result of the merger? Because where I'm kind of getting at is, I mean, you've talked about, say, $4 billion in third-party spending that you're doing and you came up with a synergy number on that. So I'm just curious as to whether there's any way of thinking about synergies in the much larger amount of third-party spending you do on media platforms on behalf of clients. And then, secondly, as you've gone through the merger process to the extent you have so far, has your outlook on what margins should be for Omnicom just on a standalone basis over the next few years changed at all?","John D. Wren","In the first question, because we are still functioning as 2 completely separate companies, we -- and as I earlier -- an answer to an earlier comment on the digital side and platforms, we have not yet sat down and done an evaluation to determine what we might do in the areas of platforms. We just have not. When you get into media, if you look in the traditional medias, it's a supply-and-demand business no matter how large you are, and clients have specific needs. So I don't see seismic moves in pricing our ability to control anything because of us combining. In the digital area, I think there are grand opportunities even if we weren't combining because there's an awful lot of media. And more and more budget is being shifted that way, and when that happens, if you get to a point where you can aggregate certain aspects of it and get lot -- get a full library of premium digital inventory, there's more and more you can do with it. Those benefits get shared with the client currently. That will only increase, I think, as we move forward.","Randall J. Weisenburger","As far as margins go, we've been committed for decades of using the power of the holding company to drive the efficiencies that are possible at each individual agency. And keeping -- we want to make sure our agencies, each of them, are operating at the right margin for their business or their optimal margin and using the holding company to make those margins continuously a little bit higher and hopefully, to reduce the volatility of performance. Mix of business is also an important driver in evaluating margins, overall. Not every business and every geography has the same potential margin. So as we move forward with greater size, we certainly believe there's new heights that we can drive margins, greater efficiencies to be had. I'm sure we're going to learn quite a bit from the standpoint of best practices. I'm sure that some of our agencies and some of the way we do things is fantastic, and I'm sure a lot of the ways that we're going to learn from our -- our new partners, what they do is fantastic, and the combination should get us to a new level.","Thank you, all, very much.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to introduce you to today\u2019s host for today\u2019s conference call, Vice President, Investor Relations, Shub Mukherjee. Please go ahead.","Shub Mukherjee","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our first quarter 2015 earnings call. On the call with me today is John Wren, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer.","We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release, we have posted on our website at www.omnicomgroup.com, both our press release and the presentation covering the information that we will be reviewing this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I have been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our Investor Presentation.","And to point out, that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially.","I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation material.","We are going to begin this morning\u2019s call with an overview of our business from John Wren. Then Phil Angelastro will review our financial results. And then we will open up the line for your questions.","John Wren","Thank you, Shub. Thank you for joining us this morning. I am pleased to speak to you about our first quarter results. As I am sure you have seen Omnicom had a solid first quarter with organic growth of 5.1% giving us a strong start to the year. We also met our margin targets for the quarter and are on track to meet our internal targets for the full year.","As reported in February, the strong U.S. dollar versus other currencies in the world will have a negative impact on our results for 2015. In the first quarter, 44% of our total revenue was derived from markets outside the U.S. FX reduced our non-U.S. revenue by $226 million, represent a 13.9% of international revenue and 6.5% of our total revenue. It is important to point out that our non-U.S. operations are naturally hedged as both revenue and expenses are in the same currency.","As a result, primary impact of these FX movements is in our dollar reported revenue and earnings. Phil will provide more details about the impact of the FX on our results later in the call.","Our operational results, excluding the impact of currencies were excellent during the quarter. More specifically, looking at organic growth by region, North America was up by 4.8%, primarily driven by brand advertising and more specifically, our media operations.","Our U.K. growth was very strong at 9.3%, reflecting solid results across our portfolio of agencies and discipline. Euro markets showed improvement and there are signs of stability in most countries in the region.","Growth during the quarter was 2.7%. France had slightly positive growth, Germany continued to be positive and Spain performed very well, while the Netherlands remained negative.","Outside the Euro markets, Czech Republic, Russia and Turkey outperformed during the quarter. Although, results in Euro market this quarter is somewhat encouraging, the pace of growth is still somewhat sluggish across the region. We are hopeful that the ECB actions and other structural reforms will be successful and help restore growth in the region.","Turning to Asia, it was up 6.7%, with most markets performing very well, including Australia, China, India, Korea, Singapore and Thailand. And Latin America saw growth of 3.4%, with strong growth in Brazil and Mexico, offset by a client loss in Chile. Our ability to consistently win more than our fair share of new business has helped us deliver our organic growth.","For the quarter and as we recently announced we has some very good wins including the consolidation of Wells Fargo Media and Digital business at OMD and organic. TBWA was awarded, Thomson Reuters, Travelers and the Royal Caribbean business during the quarter.","And just last week Bacardi announced the global consolidation of their creative and media across all their brands with BBDO and OMD. These are just the few of the key wins and there are many more throughout the company. I want to congratulate all of our agencies and people for their ongoing success on this front.","Looking at our bottom line, despite the currency impacts on the U.S. dollar, our net income was up just over 2% and our average share count was down over 5% from the prior year. The combined result was an increase in EPS of almost 8%, or $0.83 per share for the quarter. Overall, we had solid organic growth. Our margins remained strong and in line with our expectations and we are on track to meet our targets for 2015.","Before turning the call over Phil, I would like to make a few comments on what we are seeing in the industry and how our strategies allow us to achieve consistent financial results.","As I have discussed in our previous calls, our industry is undergoing a major transformation as new digital tools and platforms emerge with media and technology evolving at an accelerating pace. As a result, we are moving from marketing to broad audiences, to marketing to people.","A recent example of this trend in U.S. is the direction linear TV is headed. In the last few months, we\u2019ve seen announcements from Apple, DIRECTV, Dish, HBO, NBC, Sony and others on the launch of some form of web streaming service. These announcements further demonstrate consumers\u2019 desire to access content, where they want it, on the choice of their device and on their timetable.","Another consequence of the rapid transformation of the industry is the huge amount of data that has been generated from new marketing technologies and platforms. As said before, that an idea is brilliant only if the idea is both brilliantly executed and grounded in a meaningful consumer insight because the volume of data is important, our ability to drive results. Doing such is the real value we bring to the table.","As marketers, our people fundamentally meet connect brands with consumers, using all relevant insights and across all platforms and devices. With the increasing complexity of the marketing landscape, our clients demand for our services is only increasing.","As you know, Omnicom has several core strategies to drive growth in this environment. These strategies are focused around the continuing improving and developing our talent, enhancing our capabilities in new markets and in driving ideas and creativity through consumer insights.","In short, we need to ensure our people to understand and apply new technologies in their creative thinking across disciplines and we need to invest in tools and platform that enable our people to drive insight and execute marketing programs on behalf of our clients across all mediums.","To achieve this, our strategy has been for our agencies to invest in developing digital capabilities from within. For example, our media agencies are reinventing themselves into technology and analytics driven businesses. Our creative agencies are building capabilities and using insights to produce new types of creative content. And our PR agencies are now experts in navigating social media channels.","We are also continually investing in the reach and functionality of our tools and platforms. All of our agencies from PR to media, to advertising and CRM have access to analytics -- centralized analytics and technology platforms.","Of course, technology is not enough. You need smart, talented people who know how to use it. It is here that I think Omnicom truly leads our industry. Omnicom University, which is run in partnership with Harvard Business School and is considered one of the foremost executive education programs in our industry, has digital skills training and strategy embedded in all aspects of the curriculum.","And at the local level, our networks and agencies do an excellent job of training and development within the context of their specific disciplines. For example, BBDO and proximity have a practice called Digital Lab, which leverages blogs, white papers, seminars and data hackathon to keep their people on the leading edge of developments in both digital and interactive marketing.","This enables them to apply their latest knowledge in their planning and creative processes. Similarly, our media network, Omnicom Media Group has a rigorous program of online and in-person course work for all their people.","Omnicom also co-hosts regular training summits for all of our agencies in the United States, Europe and in Asia in partnership with companies such as AOL, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Snapchat, where our people are able to experience the latest technologies about rolling the marketplace. This training is critical. It is our way to ensure that our talent around the globe has the technology know-how and digital insights needed to deliver solutions for our clients.","In summary, we are heading into 2015 from a position of strength. We are on track to meet our full year growth targets and have made great strides against our key strategies objectives. Omnicom continues to be an industry leader, embracing new technologies and delivering outstanding creative results.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the numbers. Phil?","Phil Angelastro","Thank you, John and good morning. As John said, our businesses have continued their strong operating performance, delivering against their financial and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients.","Our organic revenue growth for the quarter of 5.1% was above our expectations. While our underlying businesses continued to perform well, the negative impact of FX continues to create a considerable headwind on our revenue. This quarter, the impact of FX reduced revenue by 6.4%, or $226 million. And as was the case last quarter, FX was negative across every one of our significant foreign markets.","As a result, an inclusive of the slightly positive impact from our net acquisition, revenue for the quarter was about $3.5 billion, down nine-tenths of a percent versus Q1 last year. I will discuss our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes.","FX also had a negative affect on our EBITDA for the quarter, which decreased $2.1 million to $405 million versus our reported figure of $407 million in Q1 last year. However, because the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenue and currencies in virtually all markets were down, the negative impact of FX on our operating margins was not significant for the quarter.","Additionally, we continue to see the positive impact of our efforts to increase efficiencies throughout the organization. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 11.7%, up 10 basis points versus Q1 2014. And operating income or EBIT decreased $5 million to $378 million and our operating margin of 10.9% was unchanged versus Q1 2014, primarily due to the year-over-year increase and the amortization of our intangible assets resulting from our recent acquisitions.","Now, turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $34.2 million, down $4.8 million versus Q1 of 2014 and up $4.2 million from the fourth quarter.","As compared to Q1 of last year, net interest expense was down $4.8 million, primarily due to positive impact of a floating interest rate swap we entered into during May and September of 2014, as well as the small increase in interest income from our cash management efforts, partially offset by the additional interest expense related to the issuance last October of $750 million of 10-year senior notes.","Versus the fourth quarter, the increase in net interest expense reflected a full quarter\u2019s interest on the senior notes issued during October of last year, as well as the reduction in interest income earned by our international treasury centers in Q1, when compared to Q4 driven by lower cash and working capital level, which are typical after year end. Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% is in line with our current tax rate projection for 2015.","Earnings from our affiliates was slightly negative during the first quarter. Any allocation of earnings for the minority shareholders and our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased by $1.8 million to $20.7 million primarily due to the purchase of minority interest in certain subsidiaries in 2014 as well as FX because of significant portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. As a result, net income was $209.1 million, that\u2019s an increase of $3.6 million or 1.8% versus Q1 last year.","Turning to slide three. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $2.8 million of net income to participating securities, which for us are the dividend paying unrestricted shares held by our employees, was $206.3 million, an increase of 2.4% versus last year.","You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was $247.4 million, which is down 5.4% versus last year as a result of the resumption of our share buyback program during the second quarter of 2014. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.83 per share, an increase of $0.06 or 7.8% versus Q1 2014.","Turning to slide four. We shift the discussed to our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against every one of our major currencies. The decrease in value of the euro had a largest translation impact on our revenue. But all currencies weakened significantly year-over-year versus the U.S. dollar during the quarter.","This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $226 million or 6.4%. The decline in the value of the euro represented approximately 45% of the total FX impact. Other non-euro currencies in Europe were approximately 15% and the U.K. pound was another 15% of the total FX impact.","Looking ahead, considering the steep decline in the value of all major currencies against the U.S. dollar, the freights continue to stay where they are. FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 7.5% during the second quarter and approximately 6.5% for the full year. That being said, with the current volatility in currency markets, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint what will happen to FX rates over the remaining eight plus months of the year.","Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $14 million driven by our acquisitions in Latin America, Europe and here in the U.S. over the last 12 months. And finally, organic growth was positive $179 million or 5.1% this quarter. It was another quarter with solid organic growth across all of our major markets with a few exceptions.","The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included continued excellent performance across our media businesses driven by the continuing expansion of our media offerings and new business wins, the most recent being Wells Fargo and Bacardi early in the second quarter.","Our full service healthcare businesses in our CRM and PR categories turned in solid performances this quarter. The continuation of the strong performance in the U.K. across most of our businesses as well as excellent performances in the emerging market this quarter, including Brazil, Mexico, India, Thailand and our Middle East agencies. In the euro markets, overall organic growth was positive including France for the first time in a while. And across the Asia Pacific region, our performance was strong.","On slide five, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split was 60% from North America, 10% for the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia Pacific with the remaining 4% being split between Latin America and Africa and the Middle East. In North America, in which the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances, we had organic revenue growth of 4.8%, again primarily driven this quarter by the performance of our media, full service healthcare and PR businesses.","Turning to Europe, U.K. once again had a very strong quarter. The rest of the Europe was up 2.7% led by our agencies in Germany and Spain as well as the positive performance of our non-euro markets in Europe. The Netherlands and Italy were again negative for the quarter and France crossed into positive territory this quarter albeit slightly.","We are still cautiously optimistic about Europe as we had further in to 2015, especially in view of the macroeconomic changes being pursued in the region. Asia Pacific was up 6.7% with strong performances from most of our major Asian markets, including China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea with one exception being Hong Kong.","Latin America overall was up 3.4% organically. Positive performance in Brazil which faced difficult comp versus Q1 of last year as well as Mexico was tempered by continued weakness in Chile. As we mentioned on the last few calls, the decrease in Chile was related to the loss of the significant local client in that market, which we will finish cycling through in the second quarter of 2015. In the Africa and the Middle East regions, although off a small base was up 10.6% led by a strong quarter from our businesses in Qatar, the UAE and South Africa.","Slide six shows our mix of business for the quarter, which again was split evenly between advertising and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 7.7% and marketing services overall was up 2.7%. Within marketing services, CRM was up 2.6%, almost all of our categories within the CRM discipline were up a bit year-over-year. Public Relations was up 3.1% and Specialty Communications was up about 2.6% on the strength of our full service healthcare businesses.","On slide seven, we present our mix of business by industry sector. There were no meaningful changes in this mix during the quarter, despite the significant impact of FX which was a good indication of the diversity of our portfolio of clients.","Turning to our cash flow performance on slide eight. In the first quarter, we generated $322 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of cash on slide nine, dividends paid to our common shareholders increased to $126 million, reflecting the 25% increase in our quarterly dividends that was approved in the second quarter of 2014. Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders totaled $25 million.","Capital expenditures were $38 million. Acquisitions including earn-out payments and net of proceeds received from the sale of investments totaled $32 million and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $256 million. Since we restarted our share repurchase program in mid May, post the termination of the merger, we spent about $1.25 billion purchased about 17.4 million shares net. All in we outspent our free cash flow by about $156 million in the quarter.","Turning to slide 10 focusing first on our capital structure. As a reminder, we issued $750 million in 10-year senior notes, a 3.65% during the fourth quarter of 2014. This coupled with the $75 million adjustment to our debt carrying value related to the in-the-money amount of our interest rate swap as required by U.S. GAAP increased our total debt to $4.6 billion as of March 31, while our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion.","The increase in our net debt of $1.1 billion over the past 12 months was driven primarily by the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $681 million as well as the negative impact of FX translations on our cash balance over the last 12 months of approximately $415 million.","Net debt increased by $891 million compared to year end, as a result of the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balances of approximately $140 million, the use of cash in excess of free cash flow for the quarter of $155 million and the typical use as a working capital that historically occurred in our first quarter. Although our net debt has increased, our ratios remain very strong.","Our total debt to EBITDA was 2.1 times and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times. And due to both, the decrease in our interest expense and the increase in EBITDA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.9 times.","Turning to slide 11, we continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of prudently priced acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 18.6% and return on equity increased to 36.3%.","And finally on slide 12, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 through Q1 2015, which totaled $10.2 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the some of which during the same period totaled $11.2 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 109%.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides on the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we are going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Shub Mukherjee","Excuse me, Operator -- just I forget to mention -- before we start the questions, we are happy to have Daryl Simm, CEO of Omnicom Media Group with us here today for the Q&A session.","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani, representing JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. John, I think in your opening remarks, I think you mentioned that you are on track to meet your internal target. I am sure if that was the margins or just organic growth or just in general. I guess my question is, can you update us on, I guess, your targets for organic growth for the year and also for margin if that was what you\u2019re implying?","John Wren","Sure. This is terribly conservative, Alexia, I think from the point of view that with currencies moving and the changes around the world, we\u2019re very comfortable by keeping our revenue target at 3.5% and -- whereas I am not 100% ready to forecast margins for the balance of the year, our internal goal starting now for the second quarter is to hold our margins from what they were the prior year.","Alexia Quadrani","And then any impact if you can highlight -- I am sorry if I missed this, the impact on a programmatic on the organic revenue growth rate in the quarter?","Phil Angelastro","Yes. Alexia, the programmatic business grew sequentially from Q4 to Q1 by about 10%.","Alexia Quadrani","Okay. And then since you have Daryl in the room, just one more and maybe Daryl can update us on I guess what you\u2019re seeing generally in advertising trends going into the second quarter, I guess any commentary about upfront would be great? Thank you.","Daryl Simm","Well, it\u2019s still -- Alexia still early from in terms of confirmed client budgets for the upfront of course. But on the other hand, we do have expectations and the expectations are that the trends that we\u2019ve really seen, I would say over the past 18 months or so, are going to continue. And what that means on balance, we\u2019ve seen of course above average growth in digital and that\u2019s been driven by premium video which we see continued increased interest.","And on the TV upfront side, I think we should expect a continuation of the kind of cautious approach that we saw this past year between upfront and short-term naturally. Some clients are going to want to secure specific properties, particularly if they have initiatives during the year. But outside of that, we see a somewhat cautious approach. For those of us that have been following the upfront for a long time, I think we are used to the past where the upfront was really a selling time for the entire year that set the market and it really has become I think the beginning of the annual sale season. And it\u2019s an important part of it, that\u2019s the beginning of the year -- of the sale season.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Bank","Okay. Thank you. I want to follow up on some of the kind of the broad thematics. I think John opened with resisted temptation to drill down further on the quarter. And I think used opportunity to ask some sort of bigger picture questions here. And it seems to me that as we speak with industry players on the advertiser side, the agency side, the media operating side, the biggest thing now I will talk about in terms of technology offering us and we\u2019re really beginning to see it is kind of more efficient achievement of reaching impressions we target, right. That\u2019s the part of all this.","And in the long run, people really seem to think that advertisers will increase budgets as long as the return on investment is positive. But in the short run, I am not so sure, there seems to be such pressure on the multinational public companies with their FX pressures and dealing with shareholders that I don\u2019t -- I am not really sure how much of that efficiency they are reinvesting. And how do you feel about that right now? Do you think clients are redeploying the savings that you\u2019re bringing them in terms of the efficiency of reach, or they sort of banking it? And how do you see that developing over time? Thanks for the long question.","John Wren","Yes. Sure. I would say many clients are reinvesting those efficiencies and there are few and that as you suggested have other challenges which they put in front of them, they are still supporting their brands, but maybe not to the level that of the efficiencies. I think clients start -- each brand starts with targets and goals and objectives that they have to reach. And if we\u2019re able to assist them in achieving those targets in a more efficient way, which is the hope, the money doesn\u2019t always have to be reinvested back directly into advertising.","For the most part, that\u2019s not a bad thing for an Omnicom. The principal way that we earn our revenues and profits are really in helping clients navigate through the complexity of this new marketplace and where audiences are, how to reach them, how to obtain quality content so they\u2019ll be interested in it. So where something which might have been invested in say traditional TV in the past, if we found an alternative way to get that audience for less money, our part of that might have increased, whereas the traditional TV seller might not have -- might see the decline in their sales.","David Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen","Hi. It\u2019s Tim Nollen from Macquarie. I wanted to ask about your comments on the upfront market, the TV market. Clearly, seeing some of the changes coming, you talk about a lot more streaming activity going on. I wonder if you could talk about from the agency perspective, from Omnicom\u2019s creative and maybe from volume perspectives, what are doing that might be a little bit different this year with the TV companies to work beyond, just the TV ad sale into a broader behavior or targeting ad sale, incorporating TV and digital viewing?","John Wren","Daryl, you might want to try this one?","Daryl Simm","Yes, absolutely. I mean, this is something we\u2019re very interested in. In fact, as we look at video, video is across a number of different platform, some of it coming from the so-called traditional providers, others coming from full episode providers like Hulu, others coming from more pure digital plays like the YouTube, the Yahoo\u2019s, the AOL\u2019s and what not.","But as we go into sale season, what we\u2019re seeing are real initiatives that are coming from some of the more traditional providers in terms of not just offering of digital video but offering of -- I would say packages or ideas and concepts that allow us to bridge between -- more aggressively between the conventional sale and the digital capability and the digital products that they now have.","And I anticipate that that\u2019s going to be an ever more significant part of the conversations going ahead. And we\u2019ve certainly seen coverage over the past few days of I think leaders of major media companies discover and they like talking about that very concept. And it\u2019s something that both, our clients and we as agencies are very interested in discussing how we extract more value for our clients using that kind of approach.","Tim Nollen","So does that mean -- you think maybe that what we consider traditional definition of TV advertising they become our archaic. I mean, it\u2019s -- how content they consumed? And 'TV' lose a share of ad revenues that that might not necessarily matter as long as there more and more dollars been placed across different points of viewership, is that a fair assessment?","Daryl Simm","Yes. I think from a high level, that\u2019s exactly right. But you also need to consider that when we look at movement of video, it\u2019s not necessarily exclusively away from television simply because its site sound and motion. Advertisers look at their plan and their strategy to reach consumers holistically and they are zero basing it year-on-year increasingly as opposed to simply looking at it within a bucket called television and reallocation. It\u2019s coming from a number of different sources. So I think we have to look at the whole environment in a much more fluid basis than we had in the past as you assess those kinds of company.","Q - Tim Nollen","Great. Thanks. Can I ask one more question please it\u2019s totally unrelated? John, you\u2019re talking about your emphasis on training. It struck me on these things a bit more about you\u2019re trending focus on economy universe at this time in the previous calls. I just wonder how you look at an organic development, organic talent development versus acquisition which have been fairly slow. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an apples-to-apples comparison or if you can maybe talk a bit more about that please and your expenditure of capital on that?","John Wren","Sure. Well, training, we opened Omnicom University in 1995 and it\u2019s been dedicated through recessions to good times to bad times. So we at the top put a lot of time and attention into training and developing our people. And that is also true if you go to each one of our major subsidiaries. With the environment and the changes in the environment, what we started in \u201895 is more important today than it\u2019s ever been [Indiscernible]. Not only do our data sciences and I\u2019d say your people need to keep up with all the changes that are going on, our creative people, our account people, everyone of our employees has to be very current in terms of watch out there how it can be used to creatively create the tools and products that we need.","So we\u2019re very pleased to have the foundation that we have and we keep it adjusting and adding to it. And that asset which was developed in \u201895, for a long time was really principally based just in the U.S. Over the last couple of years we\u2019ve taken that throughout our entire global portfolio and we\u2019ll continue to do that. And I forgot the first part of your questions.","Q - Tim Nollen","Acquisition?","John Wren","Acquisitions. We just formed the new dedicated acquisition group, one that we even had in several years. And we\u2019re looking at quite a number of opportunities, probably on a more formal basis than we have in the last several years. And so I expect over time, we will be doing more but nothing -- no big banging type of things. Sensible acquisitions -- midsized that fit, what we see as our strategic growth areas, both in the United States in certain product areas and in certain key emerging markets.","Phil Angelastro","Yeah. I mean, just to add on that, I think we\u2019ve always been consistent in saying and it still holds true. But as we approach our capital allocation process to the extent that we can find more acquisitions that need or fit in strategy requirements, we\u2019re going to try and do more acquisitions in anyone given year than less.","We don\u2019t have a fixed box of acquisition dollars and\/or share buyback dollars that we intend to spend going into a year. So, I think the pipeline is good and to the extent, we can do more than we\u2019ve done in the past and in a particular year, we will. But to the extent that we don\u2019t find deals that meet our strategic requirements or the fit requirements then we\u2019ll continue to operate as we have.","John Wren","And to give you a very timely example, when we\u2019ve done with this call, my next two hours after that is with an acquisition candidate.","Q - Tim Nollen","Great. Thanks very much for the color.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Bill Bird with FBR. Please go ahead.","Bill Bird","Good morning. I might have missed it, John, but could you give the net new business figure for the quarter and maybe speak to just the new business pipeline overall? Thank you.","John Wren","So, Phil, you have the number?","Phil Angelastro","Yeah. The number was just below $1.1 billion for the quarter. That doesn\u2019t include -- does not include the most recent Bacardi one.","John Wren","In terms of the pipeline, it\u2019s pretty good. We have one or two. We\u2019re going to wind-up defending, but for the most part the people and client -- potential clients we are talking to, we feel very good about it.","It\u2019s changed here little bit. You still get formal bids and competitions, but increasingly, we are getting assignments as we did like in Bacardi, which did not require a bid. There was a consolidation with certain objectives that approved. We are going to help that company reach.","So it\u2019s healthy, always could be. We have a very good track good record. So the more or somebody else business that goes into review, yeah, the more -- the better opportunity is for us to win. So, but it\u2019s pretty decent though.","Bill Bird","And what are your current thoughts on the phasing of your stock buybacks and your leverage? Are you at a level of leverage that\u2019s consistent with your target or could you see it going higher?","Phil Angelastro","I think our leverage is probably right where we have historically been, right around that. And our focus is primarily on maintaining our rating at that principal focus in terms of how we look at our capital structure.","So I think it\u2019s probably safe to say that, you shouldn\u2019t expect to see the next 12 months in terms of buyback activity to be anywhere similar to the last 12 months. Over the last 12 months we\u2019ve bought back about a 1.250 billion of stock. So we have some catching up to do as we had discussed last May.","I don\u2019t think you can expect the activity be at that level. Certainly, we will continue to look at it in context of our free cash flow as far as continuing to pay dividend. What acquisitions are out there that we do endeavor to do, is going to reduce the number. But certainly the activity prospectively as we look at the next 12 months is going to be down relative to the last 12 months.","Bill Bird","Thank you.","Operator","We will go to line of John Janedis representing Jeffries. Please go ahead.","John Janedis","John, since your last call, there has obviously been a lot of talk around rebates and general business practices across the industry? Can you remind us to what extend you use them and the transparency with clients? I am just try to understand the risk if any to Omnicom?","John Wren","Yeah. I\u2019ll let Daryl -- better I\u2019ll let Daryl, who heads the group, answer that first and then I will add my comments.","Daryl Simm","Right. Well, there\u2019s certainly been a lot of coverage on it. But, certainly, from our standpoint, our media agencies in the U.S. don\u2019t seek rebates and the U.S., of course, is not a rebate based marketplace from a negotiation standpoint.","So in terms of our media agency clients, in the U.S. they receive all value that gets negotiated on their behalf. Whatever that form is, whether it\u2019s discount, whether it\u2019s other quantitative benefits, whether its qualitative benefits.","And they are negotiating in a very competitive marketplace. So our buyers are pushing hard to, frankly, extract maximum value out of those vendors in order to meet our individual client expectation.","And of course, all of the clients that we engage with, we have comprehensive contracts that govern not only the services, but we provide them. But they specify performance requirements as well. So that\u2019s kind of cornerstone of trust I think in terms of how we run our business.","John Wren","And I am happy for the question, because there has been a lot of innuendo and comments against the industry, and we know how we operate and have consistently operated. So clearing the air on this is a positive thing. One other thing is, we are fully participating, I think, the ANA after having allowed that presentation to occur and there is now, I think, a working group between the ANA\u2026","Daryl Simm","And the AAAA\u2019s.","John Wren","\u2026 and the AAAA\u2019s to, yeah, to go through this\u2026","Daryl Simm","Yeah. To go through the presentation that we have provided at the ANA.","John Wren","It was somewhat odd to me that no specific allegation was came against anybody, even though in that presentation that had redacted contracts and other things. So we are little bit confused. We don\u2019t find it helpful. So as quickly as jointly the ANA and the AAAA\u2019s can get to the conclusion the better off we will all going to be.","John Janedis","Yeah. Thanks, John. Maybe separately, I think, you have been somewhat cautious on the potential for U.S.-based multi-nationals to adjust budgets based on the moves in currency? Is there any evidence of that and do you think that risk has diminish somewhat for the year?","John Wren","There is a sense. I don\u2019t have the proof. But U.S. economy appears to me to be getting stronger and if history guides anything, those budgets will increase as demand increases for and clients are going to support their strongest growth areas. So I\u2019m cautiously optimistic, I am going to, I am just not willing to publicly forecast the year more than what I can see at the moment.","John Janedis","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Craig Huber representing Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Craig Huber","Good morning. I\u2019ve a few housekeeping questions. First, programmatic, you touched on this briefly, but in dollars how much programmatic training efforts on that half of your clients help your revenue on year-over-year basis in the quarter, please?","Phil Angelastro","In the first quarter that number was about $40 million of year-over-year growth in the quarter versus the first quarter of last year.","Craig Huber","Okay. Then also for your share buybacks in the quarter just on the same page, what was the gross number of shares you bought back and what was the net number of shares, please?","Phil Angelastro","Just give me a second to get that number. So in the quarter the buyback number was in shares, I think, was 3.4 million shares.","Craig Huber","Do you have that net number?","Phil Angelastro","I don\u2019t have the net number handy but we can get that. We can get that for you.","Craig Huber","Okay. And then also your comments on acquisitions, I think you said that you have a new team that\u2019s looking at acquisitions on the corporate level. Should we -- and further you may start to do some larger acquisitions that just sort of tuck into -- you mentioned midsized. In my mind, you have been more doing tuck-ins over there, over the many years, maybe -- giving a much larger company looking maybe something little bit larger than you historically have done?","John Wren","Really, it all comes down to the opportunity but the areas that we\u2019re focused on are geographic in nature, which means that there are not -- they certainly fit within our historical profile. And different forms of partnerships over the last several years, we\u2019ve formed over 100 plus partnerships with various companies either in technology and some other areas.","In very rare instances but a couple we might be interested in becoming partners with some of those folks. But if you\u2019re characterizing what I said and thank you for asking the question, they are going to be -- they are not going to be large. They are going to be closer to our historic pattern than us developing any new pattern. Let me put it that way.","Craig Huber","Okay. My last question please, on the U.K., you obviously had very strong performance of 9.3% of organic growth. Is there anything one time in nature there? I just want to get little -- more clarity why it was so strong there and how do you feel about that market for your operations for the rest of the year? Do you think that\u2019s possible to be up in the high single digits for the rest of the year?","Phil Angelastro","I think our view is especially in the first quarter which is relatively small quarter. You can\u2019t draw too many trends when you start narrowing it down to regions or disciplines et cetera. So the more you narrow that number especially in a quarter, a 90-day period we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to drive the trend for that particular, in this case, country.","Our businesses in the U.K. have been performing very well, very consistently actually over some time. And they have done very well in the market. We expect them to continue to perform well as the year goes on. But I -- I don\u2019t think I\u2019d say we expect based on our internal forecast today that we are going to be in the high single digits to low double digits for the U.K. the rest of the year. Some of that could be a bit of timing in the quarter. Some of it could be just a fact that is first quarter and number is relatively small number compared to the number for the year. So I wouldn\u2019t draw too much of a trend other than the trend that our businesses in the U.K. continue to perform well is one that we expect to continue.","John Wren","I echo exactly what Phil said. I guess, we were aided by the change in management of one or two major subsidiaries and they\u2019ve had -- they've gotten off to a great start. So the market share and not the economy in the U.K.","Craig Huber","Can I just sneak in one more question please? I appreciate your guys\u2019 comments on the upfront market. Talking of linear TV as you call it here for the upfront market, do you guys think it\u2019s possible this year that CPMs for traditional television in the upfront could actually be down this year?","John Wren","Obviously, it\u2019s a supply and demand market place and there are still supply issues in the linear TV market place that keep pressure on price beyond, I think what you might reasonably normally expect, defining your ratings would be less value at lower prices not necessarily the case. I think the major part of that formula is going to be the balance between the long-term and short-term strategies that sellers take in this market place.","I would add I think that CPMs of course have one way to look at the market place. I think the general trend here is a longer term trend is more significant and that is that generally speaking, our clients are moving to -- many clients at least are moving to -- looking at business measures.","What do the aggregation of the investments that they are making across media types do to move their business with the data capabilities that we have? And they are somewhat less inclined to focus simply on what maybe called process measures, which are the CPMs reaching frequencies, is becoming increasingly an overall ROI discussion with our clients. But specifically to your question on CPM, I think the balance between long-term and short-term strategies from sales standpoint will dictate that.","Operator, we are getting closer to the market open. So, I think we have time for one more call. Thanks, Craig.","Operator","All right. Our final question today then will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019d sort of pick up on the programmatic question maybe broaden little bit for Daryl and for Phil. So the -- I think the comps got harder for you in the first quarter on programmatic but the number was bigger than at least we expected. Can you assume that\u2019s mostly are all domestic and if I strip that out, it looks like the organic U.S. growth, maybe a little bit, maybe around 3%, maybe a little bit less, which is slower than it\u2019s been for the last three quarters? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve looked at it that way.","And if you think that\u2019s the right math, I just want to get your commentary on whether that business is bigger than you thought and what the impact is to your overall organic growth? And then I will -- since it\u2019s a last question, I will ask Daryl. One of the things on programmatic we\u2019ve heard is just a lack of premium inventory, generally particularly around video. The TV networks have been very reluctant to move into these platforms and even some of the digital players are nervous about it. Can you just give us an update on whether you are seeing a change there and whether that\u2019s something that you think can make this business grow even faster in 2015?","Daryl Simm","Yeah. Well, I think it can certainly help the business grow faster. But if we look at the programmatic business today, there is no question that the great majority of it, as it exists today is display-based business. But the client requirements that we are seeing from the plans that we put together show a great demand for programmatic videos. So it did cross my mind that the demand is there and where there is demand, generally speaking, we will see supply respond to that. But the availability of -- I would say premium video is not simply a programmatic. A question it goes beyond that, as our clients looked at it, both programmatically and as alternatives in the upfront marketplace because content and context are so important to the kind of clients that we have. So if there is the -- whether it\u2019s the content has the right affinity or whether it\u2019s simply just wholesome enough for their brand is key and access to that kind of bringing video is key to growth. There is no question of the demand therefore.","Ben Swinburne","Yeah. Thank you.","Bob Livingston","On the specifics to your question, Ben, so the programmatic growth was not just U.S. only. That\u2019s pretty much went many markets throughout the world now. We started that ramp up back in Q4 of \u201913. The growth in the quarter itself relative to Q1 of \u201914, we thought was pretty good. Again, we are not really drawn too many trends on one particular quarter as it relates to the rest of the year.","I don\u2019t think the first quarter is going to tell the story for the year. But I\u2019d say the programmatic business in Q1 of \u201914 was probably still continuing to ramp up and the performance this year in the first quarter was good. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve drawn any trends at that level of growth that, that number is necessarily going to continue throughout the rest of the year.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you.","John Wren","Okay.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to introduce you to your host for today's conference, Vice President of Investor Relations, Shub Mukherjee. Please go ahead.","Shub Mukherjee","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our second quarter 2016 earnings call. On the call with me today is John Wren, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Phil Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer.","We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release. We have posted on our website, www.omnicomgroup.com, this morning's press release along with the presentation covering the information that we will review this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I've been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation. And to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectations, and that actual events or results may differ materially. I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. You\u2019ll find a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.","We're going to begin this morning's call with an overview of our business from John Wren. Then Phil Angelastro will provide our financial results for the quarter. And then we will open up the line for your questions.","John Wren","Thank you, Shub. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. Second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.4%, continuing the pace we set last quarter and in line with our expectations. We also met our margin targets for the quarter and remain on track to deliver a 30-basis-point margin improvement for the full year 2016 or 13.7% EBITDA versus 13.4% in 2015. For the second quarter, EBITDA margin was 15.2% versus 14.9% last year.","Our results were solid during the quarter even in the face of continued currency headwinds. In the second quarter, 44% of our total revenue was derived from markets outside the United States. As a result, foreign currency in the second quarter reduced our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. It's too early to fully assess the impact resulting from the ongoing Brexit discussions and upcoming U.S. elections. So far the most significant effect is the continuing weakness of the British pound on our reported revenues.","Additionally, when combined with backdrop of recent terrorist related events, clients have become more cautious with the most immediate effect being the cancellation of some customer events, which has had an impact on some of our share and businesses. Phil will provide more details during his remarks.","Looking at our organic growth, it was broad-based across geographies. Our strong consistent performance over many years is a testament to the strength of our services and the diversity of our offerings across the portfolio.","By region, North America was up 3.2% with our media, advertising, and specialty health businesses performing quite well during the quarter. Our growth in North America reflects in part the new business we captured in the United States in 2015 as well as the continued strength of our digital and data driven platforms. Revenue from some of our 2015 new business wins start in the second half of this year and recent new business wins like Volkswagen media start in 2017.","In terms of client trends, we continue to see growth in digital media despite increasing concerns around digital measurement, viewability, and fraud. We also see modest growth in TV budgets, which is fueling the stronger upfront U.S. TV market with pricing up double digits in many cases. Please note these increases while good for the TV business do not directly correlate to an increase in revenue to us.","Our UK growth was 3.3% with specialty healthcare and public relations having very strong performances in the market this quarter. In the euro markets, Spain and Germany were positive; France and Netherlands were slightly negative for the quarter as those countries continue to experience tepid economic growth. Outside the euro markets, we had very strong growth with the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Turkey, generating solid results.","Looking ahead, it is still too early to know what the impact of Brexit will be for the advertising market in Europe. What is clear is that the UK decision to leave the EU creates uncertainty and may slow down decision-making in many markets. Our agencies continue to operate without disruption in the UK and Europe. Over time, we expect the volatility and the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote to subside and for our agencies to adapt to the post- Brexit marketplace. Omnicom remains committed to serve the needs of our clients in the UK and European markets and to our people who provide great value to them.","Turning to Asia, second quarter organic growth was 4.5% with almost all of our markets showing positive results. India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam were exceptionally strong in the quarter. And Latin America grew 1.7% with Mexico well into double digits, which more than offset the negative performance in Brazil. While Brazil continues to be a challenge, we saw better performance compared to the first quarter of this year. We are hopeful that this trend will continue and that the recent changes in leadership and economic policies as well as the Olympics later this summer will have a lasting positive effect.","Looking at our bottom line, EPS increased 7.9% to $1.36 per share for the quarter versus $1.26 per share for the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of currencies, EPS would have been higher for the quarter. Phil will provide the details during his remarks.","Our results follow a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.55 earlier in this quarter. Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance for the quarter and the first half of the year.","Turning now to media and the ANA report, which was released earlier in June, as we said from the offset, our U.S. media agencies do not seek or retain rebates and return to clients all value negotiated in the form it is received. In the case of one global digital media provider, there is an incentive provision in our agreement that includes the U.S. This incentive continues to be returned to all clients in the U.S. on a pro rata basis according to their spending with this provider. We have contacted our clients to review our agency buying protocols, reassure them of the practices we follow, and address any questions they have.","At Omnicom, we maintain strong compliance controls in both meeting the spirit of our client relationships and the terms of our client contracts. Our outside counsel formerly asked ANA, K2, and Ebiquity to share any specific findings relating to Omnicom, so we can ensure continuing contracting plans, no findings have been provided. It is our hope that after the Ebiquity report is released, the ANA and 4A's restore the joint task force that was suspended earlier this year so that a meaningful and clear agreement on joint practices and principles can be reached between advertisers and agencies.","With respect to our media operations, we continue to outperform the industry. Volkswagen recently selected Omnicom Media Group's PHD as its global media agency following a lengthy review. It was a huge win for PHD covering all VW Group brands including Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Fiat, , Skoda and commercial vehicles. Volkswagen indicated that our team stood out versus the competition by offering new digital data and analytical techniques for improved media targeting.","In addition to VW, PHD also won media assignments from Delta Air Lines and Carnival Cruise Lines and our OMD media agency won Ancestry.com business. These results follow the win of P&G's North America media business and the creation of our third media network Hearts & Science, which launched with integrated data analytics and marketing science capabilities into its core media service. What we\u2019ve been seeing in media, we are now experiencing more broadly across our advertising businesses as more clients are focused on leveraging data to inform creative messaging decisions.","In several new business opportunities clients are asking us to increase the collaboration of our media and creative services in order to maximize these benefits. The changes we are seeing underscore the importance of talent and capabilities we\u2019ve assembled in Annalect, our data and analytics platform, which is integrated through sources across many of our agencies allowing our creative talent to bring new insight and value to clients.","Across Omnicom we continue to expand our capabilities and simplify our service offerings through internal investments in our agencies and through acquisitions. We recently announced the formation of two groups: one that aggregates our diverse offerings in the global healthcare industry into Omnicom Health Group and one that combines the strength of all Omnicom's public relation firms Omnicom PR Group. Both groups made their first acquisitions in the second quarter.","Omnicom PR Group acquired, Rabin Marti, a healthcare consulting firm that focuses on global public health issues including chronic disease, enhancing women's health, and preventing the spread of infectious disease. Rabin Martin\u2019s deep expertise in global public health is an important in growing specialty area as an increasing number of our clients see the need to address critical health issues in the world.","Omnicom Health Group\u2019s first acquisition was BioPharm, an agency that specializes in multichannel marketing programs for pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients. Founded in 2005, BioPharm has an impressive client roster, which includes 17 of the 25 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Omnicom's Health Group is organized by service offerings into four primary categories based on clients needs: professional, patient, payer, and regulatory, evidence and medical.","To further our capabilities in professional services, we recently launched DDB Health. DDB Health includes five professional healthcare agencies spanning the U.S. and Europe. Omnicom Health Group now has creatively inspired dedicated partnerships with each of our global creative networks: TBWA\\WorldHealth, BBDO Health Work, and DDB Health. I'm happy to report that we are seeing good results strategically and operationally from both Omnicom Health Group and Omnicom Public Relations Group.","We're also in the process of forming another group comprised of our independent national agencies including Goodby, Silverstein, GSD&M, Martin Williams, and Zimmerman among others. While these agencies will continue to go to market as independent brands, we believe placing them in a singular group will provide benefits through the sharing of best practices across their management and operations.","Finally, I recently returned from the Cannes Lions Festival. I am always impressed when I meet our creative talent from around the world. I am proud to report the caliber of our creative continues to be outstanding. We proved once again we have the best people in the business producing award-winning campaigns for our clients. Here are a few of the highlights demonstrating the depth and breadth of our challenges.","Nearly 90 Omnicom agencies won almost 300 Lions from 27 different countries across more than 20 categories. Omnicom Media Group including OMD and PHD earned the most media alliance of any media agency holding company scoring a grand total of 15 awards. BBDO placed second and DDB was fourth in the network of the year category. And finally, [indiscernible] BBDO won the title of Agency of the Year. I want to congratulate all of our people and our agencies for their outstanding work.","Our investments in talent, technology and partnerships are making a difference for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these areas as the marketing environment increases in complexity.","In closing, we achieve our goals for organic growth, margins and profitability in the second quarter. While it is impossible to predict the effects of Brexit as well as the impact of the U.S. presidential elections, we remain cautiously optimistic for the second half of the year and on target to achieve our 2016 plan.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?","Phil Angelastro","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the second quarter of 2016, our business has once again delivered on their financial and strategic objective while continuing to deliver best-in-class services to their clients. Our organic revenue growth of 3.4% for the second quarter was in line with our expectations and keeps us on track to meet our organic growth target of 3% to 3.5% for the full-year. As has been the case for the last several quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to create a negative FX headwind on our revenue. For the second quarter, the reduction was 1.6% overall or about $63 million.","Net acquisitions added 0.3% to revenue this quarter in addition to the Grupo ABC acquisition in Brazil that we closed during the first quarter. In the second quarter, we added Rabin Martin, a healthcare public relations agency and BioPharm, a specialty healthcare agency late in the second quarter. As a result, total revenue for the quarter was just under $3.9 billion, an increase of 2.1% versus Q2 of last year. I will discuss our revenue growth in further detail in a few minutes.","Moving down the P&L below revenue, our Q2 EBITDA increased 4.3% to $590 million and the resulting EBITDA margin 15.2% represented a 30 basis point increase over Q2 of last year. The margin improvement, which is also in line with our expectations for the full year of 2016 as a result of our continuing efforts to leverage scale as we continue to pursue efficiency initiatives in the areas of real estate, back office services, information technology, and strategic purchasing across the entire organization.","Operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased 4.3% to $562 million with operating margin improving to 14.5% in line with the increase in our EBITDA margin. Now turning to the items below operating income, net interest expense for the quarter was $44.8 million, up $4.7 million versus the first quarter of 2016 and up $10.2 million versus Q2 of 2015. The increase in net interest expense versus the first quarter was primarily due to the termination of the fixed to floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. ","As you know, in April, we issued $1.4 billion of tenure senior notes and redeemed $1 billion of notes that reach maturity on April 15. Although we incrementally added 400 million in debt, it had little effect on interest expense as rates have declined compared to when the 2016 notes were issued. Interest income earned in Q2 was lower compared to Q1 of 2016 as a result of lower interest earned on our cash balances, which were lower on average during Q2. ","Similarly, as compared to Q2 of last year the increase in net interest expense of $10.2 million was primarily related to the termination of the fixed to floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. Additionally, our interest income on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by negative FX translation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%, which is down slightly versus Q1 of 2016 and the prior-year as well, as result of some small tax planning items. ","Earnings from our affiliates total $2.8 million for the quarter down a bit versus Q2 of last year. The allocation of earnings to minority shareholders in our less than fully on subsidiaries decreased by $3 million to $25.8 million. The decrease is primarily a result of two factors; first, the impact of FX because a large portion of our less than fully-owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. and second, the purchase of minority interest in certain subsidiaries over the past year. As a result, net income was $326 million that's an increase of $12 million or 3.9% versus Q2 of last year. ","Turning to Slide 3, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after allocation of $2 million of net income to participating securities was $324 million, an increase of 4.5% versus last year. You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 239 million shares, which is down 2.7% versus last year, as a result of repurchases of shares over the past year. ","As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.36, up $0.10 or 7.9%, versus Q2 of 2015. On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS, and other information for the year-to-date period, and for the year to date results are essentially in line with the results for the quarter, I will just give you a few highlights . Our organic revenue growth of 3.6% during the first six months of the year, the FX headwind reduced revenue by 2.2%. ","Factoring in the increase from acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.1%, our revenue increased on a year-to-date basis by 1.5% to just under $7.4 billion. EBITDA increased 4.1% to just over $1 billion. As a result of the initiatives we mentioned over the last several calls, both our EBITDA and operating margins on a year-to-date basis have increased consistent with the increase from Q2. ","And on Slide 6, you can see our six month diluted EPS with $2.25 per share, which is up $0.16 or 7.7% versus 2015. Turning to Slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. Starting with FX for the quarter, the net impact decreased our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. The dollar remains relatively strong overall and when compared to Q2 of 2015 strengthened on a reported basis against most of our major currencies, including the pound, the reis, the Chinese Yuan and the Australian and Canadian dollars. ","However, the U.S. dollar weakened on a reported basis against the euro and the yen. Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are, the negative impact of FX may reduce revenue by about 1.5% during the third quarter and for the full-year. That being said, given the result of the Brexit though and the current volatility in the pound, as well as other global currencies, this estimate is certainly subject to further change as we move through the second half of the year.","Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increase revenues $13.2 million in the quarter or 0.3%. Along with the acquisition of Grupo ABC in Brazil during the first quarter, this figure includes the impact of the acquisitions we\u2019ve made in the U.S. and Europe over the past 12 months. The net figure also includes the impact of some strategic dispositions that we\u2019ve completed as well. ","Going forward, we expect the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions will continue to be positive by about approximately 50 basis points per quarter. Finally, organic growth was positive $129 million with 3.4% this quarter. It was a solid quarter of growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Brazil, France, and the Netherlands. ","The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued strong performance across our media businesses, as well as several of our advertising brands, our full-service healthcare businesses, which turned in solid performances and despite weaknesses in France and the Netherlands the euro markets overall had positive organic growth . ","The Asia-Pacific region also had solid performances across almost all of our markets. And in Latin America excellent performance by our agencies in Mexico, which offset the continued challenges experienced in Brazil. Further highlighting our regional mix of business on Slide 8, you can see during the quarter the split was 60% for North America, 9% for the UK, 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia-Pacific, 3% for Latin America, and 2% for Africa and the Middle East. ","Turning to the details of the performance by region on Slide 9, in North America we had organic revenue growth of 3.2%, driven by the continued strong performance of our media businesses, as well as several advertising brands and our full-service healthcare businesses. In Europe, the UK had organic growth of 3.3% on the strength of our specialty healthcare and PR businesses. ","The rest of Europe was up 4.3%, led by our agencies in Spain and the Czech Republic with a solid performance in Poland and Russia as well. Germany was also positive, while the Netherlands and France lagged with negative growth. The Asia-Pacific reason was up 4.5% most markets growing very well during the quarter including greater China and Japan. Although relatively small, we also saw double-digit organic growth from many of our emerging market countries in the region, including India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. ","In Latin America, strong performance by our agencies in Mexico offset continued weakness in Brazil as the region was up organically 1.7% for the quarter. Brazil was down once again, but the negative impact this quarter was better compared to Q1 of 2016. However, it is still too early to tell when the political and economic situation will stabilize. In Africa and Middle East, which is our smallest region was slightly negative. ","Slide 10 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter, the split was 53% for advertising services and 47% for marketing services. Our advertising discipline was up 7.7% in the quarter led by the performance of our global media businesses and several of our advertising brands. ","While CRM was down 2.7%, the results were mixed across businesses and geographies. The reduction in CRM was driven primarily by our events, field marketing, and point of sale businesses. PR was flat this quarter. As we mentioned the last quarter's call, we expect this performance to continue to improve as we move through the second half of the year. And specialty, medications was up 4.4% organically. The solid performance was driven by Omnicom Health Group with several new business wins by our full-service healthcare agencies. ","On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. When comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2016 to 2015 you can see there was some minor shift in the distribution of our client revenue by industry, but nothing particularly significant. Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 12, you can see that in the first six months of the year, we generated $722 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. ","As for our primary uses of the cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $243 million. Keep in mind though the 10% increase in our quarterly dividend that we announced back in April was effective with the payment we made in early July. The cash flow impact of the increase will be seen starting in Q3. Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders totaled $52 million. This is down versus last year, due to the purchase of additional shares from our local partners in prior periods. ","Capital expenditures were $78 million, acquisitions including earn-out payments totaled $360 million, and stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $352 million. All in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $362 million in the first half of the year. ","Turning to Slide 14, regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at June 30, 2016 of just over $5 billion is up about $490 million from this time last year, reflecting the incremental $400 million increase in our borrowings related to the debt issuance back in April, as well as an increase in the non-cash fair value of our debt of about $90 million, directly related to and offset by the positive fair value of the respective interest rate swaps on our debt, as required to be reported on the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP. ","Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.5 billion, up $310 million versus the June 30, 2015 amount, primarily resulting from two non-cash items in the quarter. The increase in debt from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and the reduction in cash from the negative effects of FX translation at the balance sheet date from our foreign cash balances. ","Additionally, positive change in operating capital of approximately $250 million was more than offset by our overspend of free cash flow of $290 million. Net debt increased by $1.546 billion, compared to year-end, as a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $362 million and uses of working capital that typically occur on our first half of the year of approximately $1.1 billion. ","As for our ratios, they\u2019ve increased slightly, reflecting the increase in our debt since this time last year. Our total debt to EBITDA was 2.2 times and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.6 times. Due to the increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio went down to 11.4 times, but it remains quite solid. Turning to Slide 15, we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. ","For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 18.4% and return on equity increased to 45.3%. And finally, on slide 16 we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10 plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2006 through Q2 of 2016, which totaled $10.1 million. And the bars, show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.2 billion or cumulative payout ratio of 111%. ","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we\u2019ve included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your view, but at this point we are going to ask the operator to open the call for questions.","John Wren","Excuse me operator, before we start the questions, we are happy to have Daryl Simm, the CEO of Omnicom Media Group with us here today for the Q&A session. We\u2019ve had him with us before and we thought having him with us today would be helpful for those listening. So, if you could get started with the Q&A that would be great.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes in the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani ","Thank you. Just two questions please, the first one is, just looking at your organic growth and your guidance, your performance in the first half, your guidance for the full-year, if you look at the midpoint of the guidance it does sort of imply a little bit of a deceleration in the back half, yet I think you\u2019ve mentioned the kick in of accounts I think one on July 1 might be a bit of a benefit in the back half. You think that's just an element of conservatism just given the economy and all that or is there something else that we are not seeing? Then I have a follow-up.","John Wren ","I think as I said in the final paragraph in my prepared remarks is we remain cautiously optimistic. We have the Olympics coming up in just a couple of days, and if our CRM business - it's events start coming back that should benefit us quite a bit in terms of our organic revenue growth would be.","Phil Angelastro ","You are right. There is still quite a bit of uncertainty out there in terms of what the Brexit really means, how soon it may or may not have an impact in the US elections, the Brazilian economy etc. So, we are - while we are optimistic we're certainly cautious at the same time.","John Wren ","I would say the fundamentals of the businesses are sound though across\u2026","Alexia Quadrani","I'm sorry just to be specific on the, maybe Phil or either John on the commentary you had on the ANA, I appreciate all the color you gave John around that in your opening remarks, but just more specifically on the, when you look at the contract negotiations going forward in light of these findings on this reported I should say, do you think that they there will be more cumbersome? Do think they will be more costly in any way? I mean, is there any sort of indirect maybe hit that we are not necessarily assuming out there?","John Wren","I will throw that one to Daryl, who would have a more specific\u2026","Daryl Simm","Yes. I think I will start the answer to that the question by saying that we certainly followed the - following the release of the study contacted all of our clients as we mentioned in the remarks to review the buying practices that we have within our agencies, and we received fairly supportive feedback from the majority of them. Some of them have asked for clarification specific to their business and naturally we\u2019ve answered that, but all these clients ordered us on a regular basis and that continues to be the case as we move forward. So, specific to your question, naturally there is more scrutiny in the area, but the contracts that are written between ourselves and our clients are as you might expect very comprehensive in nature and we don't see any change in that.","Alexia Quadrani","If I could just squeeze one more in, since we\u2019re lucky enough to have Daryl on the phone, Darrell on the upfront, the strength in the upfront that we\u2019ve seen, how much of that do you think is, I think John you mentioned double-digit price increase in some cases, how much of that is just a shift out of scatter sort of the reallocation, how much of it is overall maybe a slight increase to our strength in the TV market?","Daryl Simm ","You definitely hit one of the factors. A year ago, we did see, over the past year I should say we did see some significant scatter premiums so part of the move is undoubtedly some advertisers moving more to the upfront to avoid the experience they had a year ago paying those big premiums, but I do think there are couple other factors contributing to the price increase itself. You've got the pattern of diminished audiences, so there is less supply there. We\u2019ve also seen some advertisers that while they are continuing to grow their digital budgets there is a tap at the brakes in that space as some react to concerns about the view ability or fraud matters. We see the demand is up some points. The prices are up higher than the increases in revenue because of the decreases in supply and we will have to see as the year unfolds whether those revenue increases hold and scatter.","Alexia Quadrani ","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes they line of Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dan Salmon ","Hi good morning everyone. John, one of the comments you made in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you are seeing some increased caution from clients and that it\u2019s particularly being seen in the CRM division. Could you maybe just expand on that a little bit and then I\u2019ll have maybe a follow-up for Daryl as well.","John Wren ","Sure. We\u2019ve seen in a couple of areas and those tend to be gross businesses, so the revenue impact is actually larger than in some other cases. Earlier in the year, we saw -- when the oil prices fell, we saw some Middle East countries that we had done events for, canceled those events in an effort to not knowing their future. That oil seems to be stabilizing, those may come back next year. And then with Paris and San Bernardino in a bunch of other terrorist type of, either domestic or planned, clients really are taking a hard look at some of the events that they would typically throw and they pull back on them, they canceled them where they could. But not certainly every event, but it was enough to have an impact of a couple of percent on our growth in the quarter.","Dan Salmon ","Great and then maybe just a follow-up for Daryl, you mentioned the capping of the brakes in digital around some of the issues on transparency, fraud otherwise, I'm going to assume that that is largely outside of the big two of Facebook and Google and that they are continuing to gain share within your budgets, is that a fair observation that it's some of the middle to longer tail sites and properties that feel that break tapping as a result of caution around the ecosystem a bit?","John Wren ","I think, what you are seeing is a general concern among some advertisers that's causing if you will the tapping of the brakes, while the issues may exist in some pockets more than others it does have a - it does soften the overall growth of the category. So, indeed there are areas that are more problematic than others, but it's an overall budget tapping of the brakes that we see among some advertisers at the moment.","Daryl Simm ","The only thing that I would add is this a growing feeling on the part of big advertisers that you can't grade your homework when it comes to measurement and with more money being dedicated to digital new standards are going to have to get agreed to so they can measure the ROI or the efforts that they are putting in.","Dan Salmon ","Great, thanks both.","Operator","You next question comes in the line of Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen ","Hi, thanks. I would like to follow up on your comments on Brixit John, just wondering can you say if you saw any weakness in the UK heading into the vote. Can you give any further color or commentary on any client reactions to the vote? And do you think there would be any spillover effects beyond the UK and I'm actually wondering if we could spend this positively and wonder if any potential slowdown in the UK might mean clients would allocate spending to other regions like the US if the economy here remains fairly strong. And then a follow-on, but related question perhaps more for Phil. Talking about the FX impact, I hear what you said about the impact on revenues. I'm assuming the impact on earnings from pound dollar would be almost nothing, but I just want to clarify that. And then if there's anything to know about interest expense FX impacts from here on? Thanks.","John Wren ","Sure. Well, Brixit with recent and I think there will be uncertainty until we get greater color, they\u2019ve just changed governments on some of the trade arrangements that the UK is able to enter into with the rest of Europe, its biggest trading partner. So, there could be shifts, there have been voices about banks making moves, but I think it's way too early to tell. The biggest impact is that we were in [indiscernible], and when you look at the demographics everybody from the UK that was there went to bed Thursday night thinking that the vote would fail and it passed. So, there is still a lot, a bit of uncertainty. We represented everywhere, so if there's a shift from one market to another, we can easily follow it and pick it up without any real destruction to our business.","Phil Angelastro","Just picking up specifically on FX impact, the impact on margins this quarter was maybe 5 basis points negative, probably a little less. I think we are finding although, FX is not always intuitive at the connection between the impact it has on revenues and our margins because it depends on where the FX movements are, what market they are in and the relative margins of those markets, generally we find when FX is plus or minus 1%, maybe 2% typically doesn\u2019t impact our margins that much, there could be exceptions, but we haven't found that this year yet. And as far as interest expense goes, and\/or interest income, FX might have as we\u2019ve experienced in the last year, year and a half here might have somewhat of an impact on our interest income on our cash balances overseas, but not on our interest expense.","John Wren ","But we weren't in pounds, too much prior to the vote is a matter of precaution.","Tim Nollen ","My question on the FX impact was really pound\/dollar and assuming your costs are there as well there probably is minimal impact on FX from the pound\/dollar exchange rate just be clear, it's just those two currencies?","Phil Angelastro ","Yeah I think that's right. I think certainly the revenues we earned and our cost base whether it's people, rent, etc. is almost all in the same currency in the UK. So, we don't think it will have negative impact on us, as far as our margins go.","Tim Nollen ","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Stabler ","Good morning thanks very much. I've got one for John, one for Phil and then a quick one for Daryl if I could. So, John, I wanted to go back to your comments on the CRM segment, you noted and called out some of the issues around events and I think those are all very understandable. However, when we look back over a longer timeframe, it does look like the segment has been underperforming, so I was just wondering if you could update us on kind of the larger assets within the CRM segment and if there any other trends that you could point out in terms of client desirability and services in there and whether adjustments would be made etc. So that's for John. Phil, wondering if you could quickly update us on the programmatic Accuen contribution from the digital media pass through and then finally for Daryl, fully understand that your response to ANA, I think we all appreciate the comments. Just wondering if you think the appetite for opaque models will change it all as a result of that report. Thanks very much.","John Wren","CRM and some of the bigger assets are like Rapp Collins, Proximity of various brands that we have. We've recently made some management changes in those areas because we're unsatisfied with the pace of growth that we have. Looking at it longer term, as you get into addressable TV and you get into measure things more closely we believe CRM is going to become more and more important as you look forward. So, we are making investments, we are making changes and going through quite a bit of effort in the whole area.","Phil Angelastro ","On your specific question related to Accuen, the growth this quarter was $18 million, which I think is what you are looking for right Peter?","Peter Stabler ","Yes. Thanks. And then Daryl any quick thoughts on the appetite for opaque models unaffected or\u2026?","Daryl Simm ","Yeah. When it comes to principle-based models it's too early I think to tell. It is, soon after the ANA study has been released. The clients still express a high level of comfort, but having said that we have been growing the programmatic business in the early days on a direct response ROI outcome-based models and we are seeing a shift that is towards more brand-based advertisers in looking for more effective targeting, they're looking for engagement and I think as this continues to evolve we will see a reduction in the share of programmatic that's on a performance basis or in a principle based model. Of course all of those clients that are participating on that basis are opting in to that model when it's principle based in programmatic.","Peter Stabler ","Got it. Thanks so much.","Phil Angelastro","What we said before Peter is even though Accuen has been around for two or three years now in full operations, we're happy to provide our clients with those services using whatever model they prefer. Ultimately, we want to go in and grow our EBITDA dollars first and foremost whatever model they are comfortable with, we're happy to provide it to them and were going to see how it continues to evolve as it gets more mature and, as Daryl had said, as more clients move more of their budgets into programmatic.","Peter Stabler","Thanks, Phil.","Phil Angelastro","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Tom Eagan from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Tom Eagan","Great, thanks. Daryl, I wonder if you could clarify a comment you made about the digital platform concerns. You mentioned client impacting their budget. So are budgets lowering? And\/or are they migrating dollars to TV? And then I have a follow-up.","Daryl Simm","The budgets are not going down. The budgets are still growing in the digital space. I would say the pace of growth among some advertisers have slowed for the reasons that I mentioned, but they are still growing.","Tom Eagan","And so is the \u2013 any slowing of the growth in digital, is that being offset by growth in TV?","Daryl Simm","It\u2019s certainly one of the \u2013 one of the factors that is helping lift the television marketplace in the U.S. that we are seeing at the moment.","Tom Eagan","Okay. And then just secondly, you may have said this already, John or Phil, but could you give us a sense of when we might expect to see the billings form P&G and VW and Carnival impact the revenue line? Thanks.","John Wren","I think even though we\u2019ve got a modest transition from P&G in the second quarter, we take over full responsibility starting July 1 and Volkswagen doesn't start until January 1 and I believe it's a multiyear contract.","Tom Eagan","Any of the other wins?","John Wren","Generally on most of the other wins \u2013 until a week ago \u2013 but there is normally at least a 90-day lag before \u2013 between winning the business and seeing the first dollar of revenue.","Phil Angelastro","We got a clock. There is quite a bit of activity every quarter in terms of both wins and losses. It's not all wins. There is quite a bit of turn especially when you consider depending on how you count them, we've got 1000 agencies or more.","John Wren","Right.","Phil Angelastro","So the model does tend to help us be a little bit less volatile and a little more consistent at Omnicom level at least.","John Wren","I would also add that, sitting here today, I have more hunters than I do farmers, so we are doing pretty well in new business though.","Tom Eagan","In Q1 John, you mentioned that the net win was about $4 billion, you expected the net win would be $4 billion for the full year, is that numbers still good?","John Wren","Phil? You \u2013 probably better.","Phil Angelastro","In terms of the \u2013 I can tell you for the quarter \u2013 second quarter, the net number was about \u2013 just about $950 million that excludes Volkswagen and Volkswagen has been reported in the press at depending on whence report you read between $1 billion, $1.5 billion or $1.6 billion and $3 billion of billings. We don\u2019t really put a lot of stock in this billings number but people certainly seem to want it, so we do our best to provide it. And frankly, we are happy to let people choose whichever number they want to put on the Volkswagen one as far as billings. We don't yet have a sense for what our revenue numbers going to be from Volkswagen, it's going to take some time to get a better handle on that and ultimately that's what our focus is.","John Wren","Right. Did that answer your question? I am far more comfortable that it would exceed $4 billion now than I was when I first made the prediction.","Tom Eagan","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Dix from Wedbush. Please go ahead.","James Dix","Good morning, gentlemen. I had three I think fairly short ones. I guess just geographically what was your growth in China, I'm not sure I heard that in the quarter and obviously people are interested in it because of the macro. Then secondly, what was the impact of all your pass-through revenues on organic growth in the quarter? I know Phil you gave the impact from Accuen, but just beyond that was there any impact that we should be thinking about? And then finally, I guess for Daryl, maybe anything in particular that surprised you about the growth of U.S. TV advertising over the past year? You mentioned a couple of factors, which you think have gone into it, but anything which given your expert perspective has struck you as surprising including anything that's come out of the upfront would be interesting. Thank you.","Phil Angelastro","On the China question, growth in greater China was probably a little bit over 3%, 3% to 3.5% for greater China. As far as the pass-through impact on revenue, we just don't track it that way. We're focused on our revenue growth overall, we don't kind of pick and choose what we may consider to be good or bad. We report in accordance with GAAP. We don't have a hybrid revenue number. We expect our agencies and our managers to manage the full P&L and not pick and choose what can be excluded or included. So we just don't track it that way.","John Wren","And I might add that there is -- under GAAP there is revenue associated with every dollar of recorded revenue. So unlike some other people who operate under different stock exchanges, we don't use headline numbers.","James Dix","Okay. I just want to make because you did call out CRM declining, is it fair to say that there tends to be more pass-through revenue in that type of business \u2013 event business?","John Wren","In the event of section \u2013 part of that business, there tends to be where you are taking responsibility for partying; you are contracting out to get services performed by third parties. That tends to be more of a principal transaction.","James Dix","Okay. So we might have seen a little bit more impact on that this quarter just because of what you talked about already?","John Wren","Absolutely.","James Dix","Yeah, okay.","Phil Angelastro","The other thing to keep in mind for us is those businesses certainly aren't new. We had all of them for quite some time.","John Wren","Correct. And businesses like [indiscernible] so we like the proximity, which is also part of CRM, tend to be more like agency, they tend to be fees.","James Dix","Okay, great. And just on the TV market?","Daryl Simm","Yeah, I can't say that there are major surprises there. I mean the advertisers [indiscernible] site, sound and motion and they will continue to be in terms of the most effective way to represent and engage with consumers their brands. So, as I said earlier, the strength that we see in the marketplace is the combination of, I would say, a modest increase in terms of budgets and a decrease in terms of supply and a concern about higher rates that were paid a year ago, our major contributors to the kind of strength that we see in the upfront. So, no, I don't see any, I would say significant surprises in that and nor am I surprised that again for the reasons I mentioned earlier that there is a tap of the brake among some clients that are concerned about their message getting through for reasons of [indiscernible].","James Dix","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Young from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Tracy Young","Yeah, hi. I will keep this quick. I guess just following up on your comments regarding CRM and your expectation that business should improve in the second half, do you think that\u2019s related to seasonal or just your expectations that that's going to improve? And then in terms of the net income to controlling interest that line, do you think that based on your comments earlier, do think that will decline versus last year on a full-year basis? Thanks.","John Wren","Well, we are about to go through our six plus six forecast meetings starting in about two weeks where I would have a lot more specific information about what our expectations are in terms of events, but we did see some impactful slowdown in the quarter from things that were canceled. So I remain optimistic, but I don't \u2013 Omnicom is not run quarterly, it's run over a longer period of time, so as long as the services we are providing are still a value to our clients, we will continue to make investments in them.","Phil Angelastro","Yeah, I think we always say in any one particular quarter don't draw a trend, I think we have seen though in the event businesses here more than just one quarter of a bit of deceleration. Sometimes those things take a little time to cycle. So, again, we'll have a better sense after we spend more time going through the next six months of the year with the management teams as where we are going to shakeout for the year.","Tracy Young","Okay.","Phil Angelastro","And as far as minority interests, our concern on controlling interests declining for the rest of the year. I think we actually hope it doesn't because that means that the businesses with minority owners are performing better and we're getting \u2013 they're getting their share of a larger piece of pie.","Tracy Young","Yeah.","Phil Angelastro","But there is a bit of \u2013 we did acquire some additional interests within the last 12 months or within the last six months I'd say that might bring that number down a bit. And the rest of it, the bigger impact frankly on that number typically is FX, so it's possible that FX will reduce numbers, it\u2019s possible FX will have positive impact on that number depends on what market it's in.","Tracy Young","Okay, thank you very much.","Phil Angelastro","Sure. I think we have time for one more question operator.","Operator","Okay. That question comes from the line of Richard Tullo from Albert Fried. Please go ahead.","Rich Tullo","Hi, guys. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I thought it was a pretty good performance in very challenging times. My first question is on the nature of the events in CRM, are these more like music festivals, large-scale events, or they regionally targeted in South America only to Zika or is it just business cycle related?","John Wren","Well, the events go across great amount of activities. One which didn\u2019t repeat this year was in one of [indiscernible] and that was based on education. In China, with the changes of what the Chinese government is doing a lot of luxury goods producers have cut back on the type of events that they are throwing in those markets and in places like Paris where there's been tragedies, we've seen a couple of events cut back or slowdown, so they are not music festivals.","Phil Angelastro","Yeah, it could be events related, I mean it could be entertainment related, it could be sports related, it could be \u2013 and typically mostly is specific clients and product driven, it can be related to conventions, it could be related to auto shows, new car launches, really run the gamut of the type of events that those businesses will put on for its clients and it is a global business. Although \u2013 I think it could change relatively quickly both up or down.","Rich Tullo","Okay. And this next question is for Daryl, in regard to the upfront, was the 10% gain attributed on the linear TV feed? Is there bigger gains on the video-on-demand advertising that's being sold? And is digital being bundled into that 10% more and more?","Daryl Simm","There's not a lot of digital bundled into that 10% number when a agreement is reached with the kind of vendor you might be thinking, although, at an increasing amount. However, the clients are as, I mentioned just a few moments ago, are focused on site, sound and motion and on increasing their digital spend in the video space. So, there continues to be a swing in terms of the share of budget in digital to video fairly aggressively. So you can take from that what you will in terms of the price strength of the video in the digital space.","Rich Tullo","Excellent. Thank you very much for taking my questions.","John Wren","Okay, thank you, everybody. Thanks for joining the call today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"16192":["Omnicom Group Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. If you need assistance during the call, please press star then zero. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to introduce to your host for today\u2019s conference, Vice President of Investor Relations, Shub Mukherjee. Please go ahead.","Shub Mukherjee","Thank you for taking the time to listen to our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. On the call with me today is John Wren, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Phil Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer. ","We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release we have posted on our website, www.omnicomgroup.com, this morning\u2019s press release along with the presentation covering the information that we will review this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I\u2019ve been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation, and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and that these statements are our present expectation and that actual events or results may differ materially. ","I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom\u2019s performance. You will find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.","We are going to begin this morning\u2019s call with an overview of our business from John Wren, then Phil Angelastro will provide our financial results for the quarter, and then we will open up the line for your questions.","John Wren","Thank you, Shub. Good morning. I\u2019m pleased to speak to you about our fourth quarter and the full year results. As we will report this morning, we were very pleased with our performance for 2016. Strategically, we remain focused on growing and developing our talent, investing in new businesses, and expanding our capabilities in digital, data and analytics, making strategic acquisitions to better service our clients, and continuing to execute on internal organization, operational and diversity initiatives. ","The results of our strategies are reflected in our solid financial performance for the year. We achieved our target for organic growth, exceeded our margin target, and delivered earnings per share growth for the year of 8.4% or $4.78 per share. Additionally in June, we increased our quarterly dividend 10% to $0.55 per share and for the year returned to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases over a billion dollars.","As we wrap up the year, I will cover our fourth quarter and the full year results and then spend some time on our goals heading into 2017. ","Organic growth in the fourth quarter was 3.6%, bringing organic growth for the year to 3.5%. FX reduced our revenues in the fourth quarter by 1.8% and 1.9% for the full year. As we enter 2017, we expect FX will continue to be a headwind. Phil will provide more details about the impact of FX later in the call. ","Our fourth quarter organic growth is a tale of varying performances across our portfolio. Overall, North America increased 6\/10ths of a percent. Growth was very positive in certain disciplines, including public relations and our media businesses. These positive results were dragged down by a few of our CRM businesses, particularly in branding, field marketing, and events. These are project-based businesses with lower visibility than many of our other services.","The U.K. was up 8.5% in the quarter as brand advertising, media, healthcare and public relations were all very strong. With respect to the potential impact of Brexit in the U.K. and the rest of Europe, we\u2019ve not seen any meaningful negative impact on our operations to date. ","Our European region was up 6.2%. In the euro currency markets, Germany and Spain were in low single digits while Ireland, Italy and Portugal all significantly outperformed. In our non-euro markets, the Czech Republic, Poland and Russia delivered very strong results.","Asia Pacific growth in the quarter was 9.5%. We had solid performance across almost every market, with India, Japan and New Zealand leading the way.","Latin America underperformed for the quarter as Brazil returned to negative growth, dragged down by continuing political turmoil which more than offset another very good quarter in Mexico. Earlier in 2016, we purchased Grupo ABC, the largest independent advertising and marketing communications group in Brazil. While Brazil\u2019s economic environment remains extremely challenging, given the strength of all of our assets, we are hopeful that we will begin to turn the corner in 2017.","On the margin front, we increased our EBITDA margin for the quarter to 14.9% versus 14.5% in the prior year. We exceeded our 2016 goal to deliver 30 basis point EBITDA margin improvement for the full year. In fact, I\u2019m pleased to report that we were able to achieve a full-year increase of 40 basis points, giving us an EBITDA margin of 13.8% for the year. This margin expansion reflects the success of our efficiency programs which Phil will discuss during his remarks.","For 2016, we generated over $1.6 billion in free cash flow and returned almost $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong.","Looking forward, our practice of the use of free cash flow, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases remains unchanged, as does our commitment to a strong balance sheet and maintaining our investment-grade rating. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with our performance for the quarter and for the full year.","In the face of numerous global, economic and political events in 2016 that affected an already tepid macroeconomic environment, we continue to address the things we can control. Our management teams remain laser focused on attracting and retaining the best talent, quickly adapting to delivering services better and faster for our clients, and managing our costs.","Let me now turn to some of our successes in the fourth quarter and in 2016. It was a very busy end to the year, especially for our advertising and media operations following another year of significant new business wins. We launched a new agency, We Are Unlimited, to service the McDonald\u2019s business which we were awarded last August. The group is based in Chicago and has people from seven Omnicom agencies together with teams from some of our key partners. Our PHD Media agency expanded its presence in more than 30 cities around the world and service the Volkswagen business it picked up in June, as well as a number of other global accounts it won, including Carnival and Delta Airlines.","Hearts & Science, our newest media agency which was launched earlier in \u201916, now counts both Procter & Gamble and AT&T as its clients. The agency has established new network offices in Atlanta, Dallas, Toronto, Puerto Rico, London, and Dubai in the second half of the year, and it will be soon launching an office in Tokyo after recently winning a large part of P&G\u2019s business in Japan in partnership with Hakuhodo. ","Our major client wins and hundreds more smaller wins across our entire group are a testament to the success of our strategies. These wins share a common thread - our investments in our people and in our digital data and analytical capabilities, our ability to act in an agile fashion to meet our clients\u2019 needs, which is grounded on a long established culture of creativity and collaboration that is the common DNA at Omnicom. Annalect, our cornerstone data, marketing and sciences group continues to be an important part of our success. Clients recognize that with Annalect, we have the ability to apply marketing sciences to drive sharper, more relevant and dynamic creative to the most receptive audiences.","Across Omnicom in 2016, we continued to expand our capabilities, simplify our service offerings, and making investments in our agencies and through acquisitions. Earlier in the year, we formed Omnicom Health Group and Omnicom Public Relations Group. More recently, we formed a group comprised of independent national agencies, including Goodby, Silverstein, GSD&M, Martin Williams and Zimmerman, among others. ","The agencies within these practice areas continue to maintain their strong independent brands and cultures. With strong leadership in each of these groups, we can better share expertise and knowledge across the management teams, maintaining and creating more career opportunities for our people, and we can better target our internal investments and pursue acquisitions to support outstanding brands within the specific practice areas. At the same time, we continue to drive innovation in connected solutions for our clients across practice areas through our expanding global client leaders group. These leaders support our largest accounts fueled by programs that increase our ability to share intelligence and collaborate with partners.","Most important, the practice areas and global client leaders provide the capability to better leverage our resources and, when requested, create the bespoke solutions for our clients. The matrix structure has been very successful to date, and several new practice areas will be launched in 2017.","Also, we continue to make selective investments, partnerships and acquisitions to expand our capabilities and geographic presence. In December, Critical Mass, a global digital agency made an investment in Prolific, a leading mobile-focused agency based on Brooklyn. Prolific\u2019s core capabilities include mobile strategy, design and engineering. ","Also in December, we completed the acquisition of Grupo Sancho, a premier marketing communications group in Colombia. BBDO has been a minority shareholder in Sancho since 2000. We are now taking the partnership to a new level by fully integrating them into Omnicom. Grupo Sancho\u2019s network of agencies already includes many of our leading brands. Sancho BBDO is a top creative agency in Colombia. Our global media networks, OMD and PHD, are part of Grupo Sancho, and together with our ownership of DDB Colombia we now have a fully managed media operation in the country. Proximity, our global CRM network is also part of the group. ","Turning to our operational initiatives, we remain focused on delivering efficiencies across the group. We are constantly challenging our people to find ways to manage their costs agency by agency. As part of the process, we continue to review the individual performance of our agencies to ensure each of them are implementing strategies to deliver organic revenue growth and EBIT growth. It\u2019s important to note that we recently increased our focus on evaluating our portfolio of agencies that are faced with challenging growth and EBIT prospects in an ever-changing marketplace. We plan to continue these evaluations as part of the process for assessing where to best deploy our investment dollars. A likely result for 2017 is we expect disposition revenue in excess of accretive acquisition revenue.","On a regional and global basis, we are leveraging our scale in the areas such as information technology, real estate, back office services and purchasing to deliver further cost improvements. Our margin improvement in 2016 was driven by these regional global and local initiatives, and we expect these efforts will drive further value for us in 2017.","Our goals for 2017 remain consistent. We will continue to hire and develop the best talent in the industry, we will relentless in pursuing organic growth by servicing and expanding our offerings to our existing clients and winning new business, we\u2019ll continue to pursue high growth areas and opportunities through internal investments and acquisitions, and we\u2019ll remain vigilant on driving efficiencies throughout our organization, increasing EBITDA and shareholder value.","With these goals in mind, our objective in 2017 is to increase our EBITDA margin 30 basis points from the 2016 level of 13.8%. Our revenue growth target for 2017 is similar to our target for 2016. Despite anticipated growth in the U.S., it\u2019s not known how changes in U.S. policies will impact non-U.S. trading relationships. ","In 2017, we also continue to make meaningful steps on our board refreshment process, which we started in 2016. Refreshment is ahead of schedule with two board members having retired in 2016 and another scheduled to retire in May of 2017. In their place, two new members have already been added to the board and more are being recruited.","At Omnicom and our agencies, we\u2019ve always strived to be a great place for people to work. Part of that commitment is a strong emphasis on talent development and diversity. Since 1995, Omnicom University has focused on leadership programs for our senior managers. Along with our agencies\u2019 many professional development programs for our people at all levels, we remain strongly committed to investing in our talent in a way that sustains and accelerates our growth ","I was also very proud at last year\u2019s Cannes Lions Festival to have joined our industry peers to launch Common Ground, an initiative where we pledged our collective support to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Omnicom selected to focus on education for our sustainable development goal. ","With respect to creating a diverse and inclusive workforce, our commitment is to start at the top, with Omnicom\u2019s independent board of directors now including five women and three minority members. In 2016, we expanded Omni Women chapters in North America, Europe and Asia. We also launched Open Pride, a resource group committed to inclusion and diversity efforts across Omnicom. We\u2019re extremely proud of our efforts to create a better workplace for our people. The Human Rights Campaign Foundation recently recognized these efforts by naming Omnicom one of the best places to work for LGBT equality. ","It\u2019s the depth and diversity of our talent that allows us to continue to be recognized in the industry. Here are a few highlights: BBDO topped the Gunn Report as the Most Creative Network for the 11th year in a row. For the third consecutive year, adam&eveDDB was named Campaign Magazine\u2019s Agency of the Year, and PHD was Global Media Network of the Year. Ad Age named PHD Media Agency of the Year, adam&eveDDB International Agency of the Year, BBDO B2B Agency of the Year, and DDB\u2019s Alma Multicultural Agency of the Year. At the Campaign Asia Pacific Agency of the Year Awards, TBWA, DDB and BBDO won Creative and Digital Agencies of the Year in Tokyo, New Zealand and China. ","In closing, I want to recognize and thank the people at our agencies for the world-class integrated campaigns, outstanding new business wins, and the great work that enabled us to deliver these results.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the fourth quarter and the full-year results. Phil?","Philip Angelastro","Thank you, John, and good morning. This year, our agencies performed well in meeting the objectives of their clients as well as winning new business. As John said, our businesses once again met the financial and strategic objectives we set for them. ","For the fourth quarter, our organic revenue growth was 3.6%, and for the full year the total organic growth was 3.5%. As for FX, the negative impact of currency rates increased slightly in the fourth quarter versus what we saw in the last two quarters, driven in large part by the continued weakness of the British pound when compared to last year\u2019s reported revenues. ","Including the positive impact from our net acquisition activity, total revenue for the quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 2.1% versus Q4 of 2015. In a few minutes, I will go into further detail regarding our revenue growth.","Turning to the income statement items below revenue, operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased 4.6% to $602 million, with operating margin improving to 14.2%, a 30 basis point margin improvement versus Q4 of last year. Our Q4 EBITDA increased 4.5% to $631 million. The resulting EBITDA margin of 14.9% represents a 40 basis point increase over Q4 of last year. The increase continues to be driven by our ongoing company-wide internal initiatives to increase efficiencies, particularly in our back office operations. FX had a negligible effect on our operating margins for both the quarter and the year. ","Now turning to the items below operating income, net interest expense for the quarter was $40.2 million, down $1.8 million versus the third quarter of 2016 and up $3.4 million versus Q4 of 2015. Our gross interest expense was down approximately $700,000 compared to Q3 of 2016. This was driven by a reduction in our commercial paper activity during the fourth quarter, which was partially offset by a decrease in the benefit from our fixed to floating interest rate swaps. The increase in three-month LIBOR rates reduced our benefit relative to last quarter and will continue to do so as short-term interest rates move upwards.","Interest income from our international treasury centers was higher in the fourth quarter when compared to Q3, resulting from the higher than average cash balances that we typically carry at the end of the year. As compared to Q4 of last year, the increase in gross interest expense of approximately $5 million primarily is due to the reduced benefit from our swaps which resulted from the termination in January of 2016 of the fixed to floating rate swaps on our 2022 notes. As a reminder, we added $400 million in debt when we issued our $1.4 billion 2026 senior notes last April. The net effect of the reduction in rates on the new notes meant that we were able to replace $1 billion of debt without a significant increase in our interest expense. Interest income was a bit higher when compared to Q4 of 2015, resulting from higher interest earned on the cash held by our international treasury centers. ","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.5% and for the full year our effective tax rate was 32.6%, which was slightly lower than the prior year rate of 32.8%. ","Earnings from our affiliates totaled $1.4 million for the quarter, down a bit when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease is due to the acquisition of a majority interest in an affiliate earlier in the year. ","The allocation of earnings to minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $2.5 million to $30.1 million. The decrease was primarily the result of the purchase of additional minority interests in certain subsidiaries over the past year. As a result, net income was $350.3 million. That\u2019s an increase of $18.7 million or 5.6% versus Q4 of last year.","Now turning to Slide 3, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $1.6 million of net income to participating securities was $348.7 million, or up $20 million or 6.2% when compared to last year\u2019s Q4. We can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 237.8 million, which due to share repurchases is down 2.5% versus Q4 of last year. As a result, diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.47, up $0.12 or 8.9% versus Q4 of last year. ","On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS, and other information of the full year. Since the annual results are essentially in line with the results for the quarter, I will just give you a few highlights. While organic revenue growth was 3.5%, the FX headwinds reduced revenue by 1.9% or a little over $280 million. Factoring in the increase from acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.3%, our total 2016 revenue increased by 1.9% to $15.4 billion.","Operating profit increased 4.6% to just over $2 billion, and EBITDA increased 4.7% to $2.11 billion. Consistent with our fourth quarter performance, our operating margin increased 30 basis points and our EBITDA margin increased 40 basis points versus the full year 2015 results. On Slide 6, you can see our 12-month diluted EPS was $4.78 per share, which is up $0.37 or 8.4% versus 2015. ","Turning to Slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. The negative headwinds from FX increased slightly this quarter versus the previous two quarters. There was some increase in the volatility of the foreign currency markets after the U.S. election, while the continuing weakening of the British pound after the Brexit vote in late June remained a significant drag. On its own, the FX impact of the pound\u2019s decline reduced our revenue by $75 million in the fourth quarter. As for our other major currency moves in the quarter, they effectively netted themselves out in total.","While the dollar strengthened in Q4 against the Chinese yuan, the euro and the Mexican peso, the dollar weakened in the quarter against the Brazilian real, the Japanese yen, and the Australian dollar. As a result, the net impact of FX decreased our quarterly revenue by $75 million or 1.8%. ","As we enter into 2017, if currencies stay where they currently are, based on our most recent projections, FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 1.25% during both the first quarter of 2017 and for the full year; however, making any assumption on how foreign currency rates will move over the next two, let alone 11 months, is highly speculative at this point.","Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue $13.9 million in the quarter, or 0.3%. We expect the net impact of acquisitions net of dispositions will be negative in Q1 of 2017 as we cycle through the Grupo ABC acquisition, which we completed in January of 2016, and as John commented earlier, as we continue to reevaluate our portfolio of businesses and focus on opportunities for growth.","Finally, organic growth was positive $149 million or 3.6% this quarter. For the quarter, we had positive organic growth across all of our major markets, with the exception of Brazil and the Netherlands. Some highlights of our growth this quarter include our advertising discipline, which performed well in the face of difficult comparisons to the growth of over 12% that was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2015. ","Strength of our media businesses, including Hearts & Science which is now ready for its first full year of operation in 2017, as well as the solid performance of certain of our full service advertising agencies continued. ","Our public relations businesses performed well across most of our markets, coming off the relatively easy comp of Q4 of 2015. Our PR discipline was also helped a bit in the quarter by some work related to the election.","Our full service healthcare businesses had another strong quarter, albeit relative to a down quarter in Q4 of 2015. Our Omnicom Health Group agencies saw particular strength internationally. ","On Slide 8, highlighting our regional mix of business, you can see during the quarter the split was 58% for North America, 9% for the U.K., 17% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, and with Latin America, Africa and the Middle East making up the remaining portion. ","Turning to the details of our performance by region on Slide 9, our organic revenue growth from North America was up 0.6%. In particular in the fourth quarter, we saw positive performances from our PR and media businesses, which was offset by declines in our field marketing, branding, and events businesses, as well as our research agencies. ","In Europe, the U.K. had organic growth of 8.5% with similar good performances by brand advertising, media, PR, and specialty healthcare. The rest of Europe was up 6.2% organically in the quarter. Within the euro zone, Germany returned to positive organic growth after its negative performance in Q3. Italy, Portugal and Spain also performed well, while France was marginally positive and the Netherlands continued to struggle. Growth in Europe outside the euro zone was strong and especially notable in the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia and Switzerland. ","The Asia Pacific region was up 9.5%, and we continue to see organic growth across most major markets in the region, including Australia, India, Japan, greater China, and New Zealand. Africa and the Middle East, which is our smallest region and starts from a low base, had growth this quarter driven by project business and was up double digits organically. ","One region that was down organically in Q4 was Latin America. After a positive third quarter which included some Olympic activity, and in the face of continued uncertain macroeconomic conditions, our agencies in Brazil had negative growth in Q4. Revenues were down by about 14% organically in the quarter. Partially offsetting the negative results from Brazil in the region, our agencies in Mexico continued their strong performance.","Slide 10 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter, split was 56% for advertising services and 44% for marketing services. As for the organic growth performance, it was mixed. Our advertising discipline was up 4.6%, a solid performance compared to Q4 of 2015 given the double digit growth we had in the discipline in Q4 of last year. Our growth in this discipline continues to be led by the performance of our media businesses, which performed well across almost all markets. Our performance was also bolstered by the good performance of a number of our full-service advertising agencies.","CRM was up four-tenths of a percent for the quarter, and the results were mixed across businesses and geographies. Our direct and digital marketing agencies and our shopper businesses had a strong performance in the quarter; however, the performance was more than offset by declines in field marketing, branding, and our research businesses. PR was up 7.7% this quarter, and as I said earlier, positive performance of PR was broad-based across most of our markets, although coming off easier comps versus the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. Specialty communications was up 5.7% organically with our Omnicom Health Group agencies performing well, mostly notably in foreign markets, recognizing however that this is compared to easier comps versus Q4 of last year.","On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. In comparing the full year revenue for 2016 to 2015, we can see there were no major shifts in revenue.","Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 12, you can see that we generated just over $1.6 billion of free cash flow during the year, including the positive effect of changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $505 million. As a reminder, the 10% increase in our quarterly dividend was effective with the payment we made in July, and therefore only half of the payments this year were at the higher amount. The cash flow impact of the higher payments was partially offset by a lower share count due to repurchase activity. Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders totaled $87 million. This is down versus last year due to the purchase of additional shares from our local partners.","Capital expenditures were $166 million, a reduction compared to 2015 resulting from a decline in leasehold improvements, lower spending on technology purchases, as well as an increase in our equipment leasing program. ","Acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled just under $500 million, and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $554 million. All in, we outspent our free cash flow by just over $200 million for the year.","Turning to Slide 14, regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at December 31, 2016 of $4.95 billion is up about $380 million from this time last year. This increase resulted from the incremental $400 million of borrowings related to the debt issuance back in April. Our net debt position at the end of the year was $1.93 billion, down $25 million compared to December 31, 2015. The decrease was principally due to the positive change in operating capital of approximately $325 million, which was offset by the overspend of our free cash flow of just over $200 million for the year, as well as the negative impact of FX on our cash balances at year end.","As for our debt ratios, they remain solid. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.2 times, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was below 1 at 0.8 times. Due to the year-over-year increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio, while still quite strong, decreased to 11.0 times. ","Turning to Slide 15, we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio improved to 24.3% while our return on equity increased to 49.8%. ","Finally, on Slide 16 we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10 years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2007 through 2016, which totaled just under $10 billion. The bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $10.5 billion, resulting in a cumulative payout ratio of 106% over the last decade.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we\u2019ve included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. At this point, we\u2019re going to ask the Operator to open the call for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi, thank you. I\u2019ve got a couple of questions. The first really is sort of zoning in on the weakness in the branding and the field marketing businesses that you highlighted. Does any one of those of the two stand out as a particular drag, and I think you also mentioned research as sort of an areas of weakness too. So I guess really wanted to dig in to see if one is particularly weaker than the other, do you think it\u2019s more structural or cyclical, or do you think it\u2019s competitive in nature, you might be losing share there, and I guess are you committed to those businesses? I think you mentioned you\u2019re going to reassess everything and look for potentially a pick-up in divestitures. Would those naturally be the area of focus? And then I have a follow-up.","John Wren","You\u2019ve got it. You hit the nail right on the head. Field marketing, which is not a strategic business to us, was particularly weak in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s typically a business that you need big box stores to hire people in to do promotions and to do some other things. It\u2019s clearly on my list as a priority, because I don\u2019t think the future for that business is anything even remotely close to what it has contributed in the past.","In speaking to some of our credit card clients, the amount of online purchasing that went on in the fourth quarter this year was--it\u2019s hitting a tipping point, so we can still get some value out of the business, but it did harm our organic growth.","In terms of research, we\u2019re never very deep in research. We have several companies in that area. They tend to be custom research shops. That with digital is changing - it\u2019s not going away, but we are planning further consolidation in that area.","In branding, branding really--the outlook in the branding businesses has always been--the backlog has always been six to eight weeks, and we\u2019ve had some difficulty with some of our rebranding efforts the entire year, it also reflected itself in the fourth quarter. We have experts--that\u2019s a business I\u2019m quite certain we can turn around, because we have very, very smart people. It\u2019s just a speed bump at the moment, and it will be getting better as you go through \u201917.","Alexia Quadrani","Then just to follow up, you mentioned on the growth outlook in 2017, organic growth outlook should be similar to 2016. Should we assume that\u2019s very much weighted towards international growth over the U.S., given the relative U.S. sluggish performance, at least in the back half of the year? How quickly can the U.S. bounce back, I guess dependent--is it dependent on how quickly some of those divestitures potential happen? Lastly, just given maybe elevated divestitures this year, should we assume maybe a little bit of a pick-up in the buyback?","John Wren","In terms of our revenue outlook, personally I\u2019m more optimistic than I\u2019m willing to say on the call. I\u2019m very confident about our ability to increase our margins just through a continuation of the efforts that we\u2019ve had to date, and they continue into this year. In terms of what the U.S. government\u2019s doing, I can\u2019t figure it out. I do believe that animal spirits have been kind of released in the U.S., and with the fixes that we have and we\u2019re planning, I\u2019m not concerned about Omnicom, I have just no clue as to what the impact on trading is going to be. Until something other than an executive order gets signed and a law gets passed, we\u2019re just being conservative. The one thing we don\u2019t want to do at this time of the year is to staff in anticipation of growth. It\u2019s always better to hire after you\u2019ve gotten growth. ","Philip Angelastro","Yes, and as far as the buyback question, Alexia, I think--I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see much change, actually. If we accomplish a couple more divestitures than we might have in prior years, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to directly lead to an increase in buyback activity. The primary driver of that is going to be how many acquisitions do we do once we get beyond paying our normal dividend. If we find some additional acquisitions that fit our criteria and strategy, we\u2019re going to want to pursue those acquisitions, that will have an impact on buybacks. The availability of those acquisitions and the number of acquisitions we close probably that will impact the buyback more so, either resulting in more or less free cash available for buybacks than the dispositions will.","Alexia Quadrani","Okay, thank you very much.","John Wren","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Roch with Barclays.","Julien Roch","Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First question is could we get the contribution of Accuen into growth in Q4, and then there\u2019s more and more talk and actually action of competition from consultants, like Accenture would come to my mind in the U.K., you had a couple of creative wins from consultants. So I wanted to see your point of view on that and whether you are starting to actually see consultants in big pitches against Omnicom. Thank you.","Philip Angelastro","So I\u2019ll take the first one. On Accuen, Julien, the growth number for the fourth quarter was $33 million in terms of the contribution, which brings the full year to 86 in terms of revenue growth from that business. As we\u2019ve said before, the programmatic business continues to evolve beyond just the original core group of advertisers who were focused primarily on achieving an ROI. Overall, we expect the programmatic business to continue to grow, whether it\u2019s through a bundled offering we have or the more traditional model. We\u2019re happy to take the business growth either way, whatever our clients would prefer, but we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we continued to see reduction in the share of programmatic that\u2019s executed on a bundled basis and growth in programmatic that\u2019s executed on a traditional basis.","John Wren","To answer your second question, Julien, I\u2019ve anticipated the consulting firms attempting to pick up some aspects of what we do for at least--seriously, for the last 20 months. We have not run into them, though, in terms of in pitches for serious pieces of business as of yet, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re very vigilant about and we also have plans to start to hire, and we have been hiring, people with similar skills to the ones that they have to supplement the normal work that we do. ","So we have a lot of competitors, but so far our batting average has been very good, but we\u2019re very vigilant on the topic. ","Julien Roch","If you haven\u2019t seen them yet encroaching on your business in big pitches, have you conversely started to encroach on their business, and one piece of business that you might not know--not have won five years ago because you have a more rounded offering, or similarly that\u2019s something to come as well?","John Wren","Well, I\u2019m not sure I got your question completely, but our business has change completely over the last five years, and I expect it\u2019s going to--that pace is just going to continue. We make significant internal investments in math, data, data analytics, and that--as we go into \u201917, those are only increasing, also the type of people, the type of skills that we have.","One major advantage that Omnicom has that we\u2019re able to capitalize on is we have built most of what we win on internally, or we\u2019ve hired and incorporated these people into the Omnicom DNA. When a company starts trying to gather these skills through acquisitions, it doesn\u2019t normally play very well within groups when you go in, and clients don\u2019t want to see people who are just meeting each other for the very first time, or have different cultures. So we capitalize on that quite a bit. It\u2019s been--I know that eventually when I\u2019m gone, it will be remembered as a strategy. I don\u2019t know if it was a strategy or just good luck, but that\u2019s what I believe.","So we\u2019re going to continue on the pace, but that\u2019s where I spend my time - looking, talking, learning, both from clients, from their needs, and from where we think the marketplace is going.","Julien Roch","Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks, good morning. One for John and one for Phil. John, we all on the call I think hear Marc Pritchard\u2019s comments or read his comments from last week. You\u2019re probably in a better position than anyone at least on this call to talk about what the audience was or is targeted for those comments. How much do you think of his frustrations are being expressed at digital media platforms, ad tech companies, or his agency partners like Omnicom? Anything that you think the industry or Omnicom needs to do to address some of those issues, and maybe just comment on the state of the digital media landscape given there\u2019s just a lot of focus there.","Then Phil, just on the margin guidance and the dispositions, I just want to make sure we understand clearly. It sounds like the expectation is net of acquisitions and dispositions, that will be a drag on revenue in \u201917. I just want to make sure that\u2019s accurate. Then second, is there a margin impact from that net disposition? I assume there\u2019s still marketing to this, is there probably lower margin, but I wanted to hear any comments you had.","John Wren","Sure. I won\u2019t pretend to speak for Marc, but I\u2019ll tell you what I believe he was saying, because I\u2019ve heard not only publicly in Marc\u2019s comments but I\u2019ve heard it in any one of a number of places. The amount of spending that\u2019s being done on digital is increasing and has been, and will continue; but we have to be able to measure the effectiveness of the media and we have to be able to have a standardized, or get close to a standardized ad verification strategy to track and to measure, and to eventually value what we\u2019re willing to pay for or what clients are willing to pay for. The other challenge is the varying devices in which you can receive messages, and it\u2019s I think most people\u2019s guess that mobile will be the largest platform where--because it is the most mobile platform for people to get their content. ","In terms of what we do, we\u2019ve personally installed integral ad science verification to make sure that our client has default protection--","Philip Angelastro","And we\u2019ve been doing that for several years now. ","John Wren","Yes, not just for them but since we\u2019ve been doing it, and it just becomes challenging and at some point, almost the equivalent of a good housekeeping seal of approval is going to have to get adopted for subscribers and publishers of content, so you have automatic faith - this is my view - in what you\u2019re buying is what you\u2019re getting. So it\u2019s almost like being in--you\u2019re not quite in the little leagues, we\u2019re in tee-ball at the moment, but the amount of money that is being spent requires these standards to get created, to get accepted by the various people spending money, because there\u2019s an awful lot of money being spent.","Ben Swinburne","Got it, thank you.","Philip Angelastro","So on the margin front, we certainly expect--I guess first on the dispositions, as far as the dispositions that we\u2019ve completed to date, we expect they\u2019ll have a small positive impact on margins, but the vast majority of the margin improvement that we expect that John talked about in his prepared remarks are not based on assuming acquisitions we\u2019re going to incur. It\u2019s largely going to continue to be driven by our efficiency initiatives.","To the extent that we\u2019re able to dispose of a couple businesses that we go through in our evaluations, which will start in a couple weeks, incremental dispositions in \u201917 are largely going to be businesses that have margins on average, because of performance issues largely and the type of businesses they are, the revenues may come down more, as John had referred to, and there may be some margin improvement as a result of that. That\u2019s not really factored into a significant portion of the margin improvement that we expect that John referred to in his earlier remarks.","John Wren","I don\u2019t often speak about what happens in my board meetings, but we concluded one last week when--I have my own wish list within Omnicom. We are interested in growth and we are interested in profit. I made a prediction about how fast I can move, Phil just sat there very politely and grinned and said, you may not be that lucky. But it\u2019s a serious, earnest review and we still think there\u2019s value in the companies that we\u2019re targeting, but I\u2019m of the firm belief that 36 months from now that value will be greatly depleted from where it is today, so it\u2019s time to act.","Ben Swinburne","Got it, thank you both.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis","Hi, thanks. Just a couple quick ones for me. First, given the large account wins in the back half of last year, should we expect organic growth to ramp throughout the year, or are there other factors we should consider?","John Wren","Well, we\u2019re trying to grow as fast as we can, is the answer. There\u2019s elements that we speak about on these calls and that you see that make up organic growth. The first one and the most obvious one is when we win new business obviously, because that can be calculated and other people speak about it and reporters report on it. What also comes out of that is where clients have a decline or change their spending habits a little bit, and we have a lot of clients, so a little bit amount of money can drag that down a bit, so it\u2019s a net number that you\u2019re seeing, not a gross number.","But we\u2019ve been doing very well and our clients, I think especially the U.S. clients, are--and they tend to be multinational, they\u2019re bullish. They\u2019re hopeful, there is confidence out there, so as long as something geopolitically doesn\u2019t get screwed up or--you know, India didn\u2019t have the greatest quarter for the Indian economy because of the change in currencies. There are some decisions which get made which impact other parts of the business from time to time, quarter to quarter, very difficult to look at it on a 90-day basis.","Philip Angelastro","Yes, in terms of the wins themselves, though, the more important part of the wins of, say, P&G, AT&T and Volkswagen were how we\u2019ve been able to establish or significantly enhance the platforms we have for growth within PHD in the case of Volkswagen, and Hearts & Science newly created in the case of P&G and AT&T. We think those platforms provide us with some significant growth opportunities. The actual amounts of revenue on the initial win, while very helpful and certainly very helpful to the businesses that won the work, they\u2019re not in and of themselves material to our overall results, and there\u2019s certainly a lot of other factors that add and some that detract from our organic growth profile - John touched on them, certainly.","So we\u2019re more bullish about the benefits that we got from those wins on what our future growth profile can be going forward, but we\u2019ve got to look at the overall portfolio, which is pretty diverse and hopefully balanced, and not everything is always going to be hitting on all cylinders.","John Janedis","That\u2019s helpful.","John Wren","Sitting here today, the platforms and the agility that we have brought into our abilities out of market, it changes all the time, you can never get too comfortable with it, but it\u2019s working today and we continue to evolve.","John Janedis","Maybe a related question, John, just on the U.K. and European growth. It\u2019s been, I\u2019d say, a bit more resilient than I think the market would have expected, given the macro headlines. Have you been gaining share there, and as you think about your outlook, do you expect that region to moderate?","John Wren","Well, we certainly have--there\u2019s two things we have. We have some of the greatest agencies in the world in our major European markets, and so they\u2019re very attractive to clients. We also--if we dissected our client base, we don\u2019t have large banks and things that are highly regulated that some of these recent changes will probably impact going forward, so we\u2019re not going backwards, we\u2019re going forwards for the most part. We have to see what\u2019s going to happen with the elections that are coming up in Europe. This time last year, I would have never predicted--the day before Brexit, we were in Cannes. I didn\u2019t predict that vote. I certainly didn\u2019t predict the presidential outcome. God knows what\u2019s going to happen in France and a lot of other key markets in Europe, so all we can do is make sure we maintain the quality of our agencies, continue to be agile as hell, and fight for every single dollar of revenue and profit we get, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.","John Janedis","Thank you.","Philip Angelastro","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Our last question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan Salmon","Hey guys, good morning. I just had a few questions, John, on the full service agencies. There were a couple things that you mentioned that were of interest. One, you called them out for strength, whereas in the advertising segment we\u2019ve seen that really driven by media and continues to be strong, but you mentioned them specifically. I\u2019m just curious, is that largely around share gains or is there something different going on with the way that they are approaching the business, either more horizontal approaches or whatnot where they may be playing the lead role? ","Then second, I think on the McDonald\u2019s business specifically, you mentioned obviously a number of Omnicom agencies involved, but you also mentioned some key partners on the team, and we\u2019ve read a little bit recently about companies from some of the large digital ad sellers like Google and Facebook more frequently embedding themselves with agency teams. Is that what you\u2019re speaking about there, and whether it is or not, can you tell us about how much you\u2019re seeing that happening across your business these days? Thanks.","John Wren","Sure. Well, we do go to market differently, and one client you point out is one where we certainly have. We\u2019ve brought people in from different skills, we are working differently, some of our media scientists are the people briefing creative people as to what audience we should be attacking, as opposed to traditional type of account people that you would have had in the past. Everything is a bit more bespoke in some of the larger ones. They\u2019re working much more closely in fewer silos than ever before.","It wasn\u2019t so much the Googles or the Facebooks, although they\u2019re very supportive of Omnicom. It was more like other vendors that the client has selected and uses, like in some cases it\u2019s Adobe, in some cases it\u2019s Salesforce or CRM. To date, we\u2019ve been able to draw lines and figure out, this is what your role is, this is what our role is - by the way, here\u2019s your desk because I need to speak to you every day and we want to improve communications. We\u2019ve just gotten better at. We were always a pretty good partner, but I believe not just top management but also upper middle management and middle management has gained confidence in the way that we can interface and work with some of these people. So we\u2019re just building it--we\u2019re building it for the client, with the client\u2019s interests in mind, not necessarily the traditional - and I\u2019ve been around a long time - silos or particular agency brand. It\u2019s morphing, it\u2019s changing because the marketplace has. ","Dan Salmon","Great, thank you.","John Wren","You\u2019re welcome.","Philip Angelastro","Thank you all for joining the call today. We appreciate it, and we\u2019ll talk to you after the first quarter is over. Thanks.","John Wren","Thank you. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference today. We\u2019d like to thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"16182":["Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call July 22, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Randall Weisenburger - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","John Wren - President and Chief Executive Officer","Analysts","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Julien Roch - Barclays","William Bird - FBR","James Dix - Wedbush Securities","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Omnicom second quarter 2014 earnings release conference call. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I'd like to introduce you to today's conference call host, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Omnicom Group, Mr. Randall Weisenburger. Please go ahead, sir.","Randall Weisenburger","Good morning. Thank you for taking time to listen to our second quarter 2014 earnings call. We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release. We posted on the omnicomgroup.com website, both our press release and the presentation covering the information that we'll be reviewing this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I have been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that's included at the end of our investor presentation, and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially.","I'd also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measure in the presentation material.","We're going to begin the call with an overview of our business from John Wren. Following John's remarks, we will review our financial performance for the quarter, and then both of us will be happy to take your questions.","John Wren","Good morning. Thank you for joining today's conference call. As I am sure you've seen, Omnicom had a very strong second quarter with organic growth up 5.8% over the same quarter last year, and we are on track to meet our revenue and margin targets for the full year.","Our results this quarter speak for themselves. Our agencies and our people have stayed focused on servicing their clients and building their businesses. At almost 6%, this is the best organic revenue growth rate we've posted since the third quarter of 2011.","Since the beginning of the year, we have won approximately $2 billion of new business, including such well-known brands as Johnson & Johnson, CVS, Sony, Heinz, Dixon, and several new assignments in the pharmaceutical sector.","During the quarter, we resumed our longstanding policies of returning our free cash flow to shareholders. In May, we increased our dividend by 25% and resumed our share repurchase program. Since mid-May, we've repurchased over $550 million in stock.","Examining our performance, I'll point several factors, which contributed to our revenue growth. The biggest driver was our performance in United States, which was extremely strong with organic revenue growth of 8.8%. This growth was fueled by our media operations, including continuing strong results in search, social and programmatic trading.","U.K. also continue to perform well, with mid-single digit growth driven by strong performances in media and public relations. In other parts of Europe, Germany was positive for the third straight quarter, while France continue to be negative. And in the larger developing countries, such as Brazil, India and Russia, we experienced strong double-digit growth.","Our agencies also performed well in China, with high-single digit growth. Our margins were up nominally due to several factors, which Randy will address in his remarks. But overall, I'm very pleased with our operating and financial performance, as we go into the second half of the year.","Let me now provide you an update on the progress we're making against our core strategies to drive growth. These strategies share a goal of helping us meet the rapidly changing needs of our clients, by giving them access to the best people and the latest technologies, where and when they need it.","They are the same, as you've heard before. Attracting, retaining and developing top talent; expanding our global footprint and moving into new service areas; building our digital and analytical capabilities, by investing in agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies; and delivering big ideas, based upon meaningful consumer insights across all marketing communication channels.","Our progress is really a reflection of the caliber and contributions of the talented people, and that showed itself again this year in Cannes. Omnicom won more Grand Prix and Gold Lions combined than any other holding company.","Let me mention just a few of the highlights from this year's festival. Adam&Eve DDB in the U.K. was named Agency of the Year, winning a total of 22 awards, including four Grand Prix Lions. Our media networks, OMD and PHD, dominated the Media Lions Category with 16 Lions.","BBDO and DDB were among the top-three networks for the eighth consecutive year. And as a testament to the diversity of our service offerings from our largest creative networks, BBDO, DDB and TBWA, all won Grand Prix awards across multiple categories.","I want to congratulate all of our people and agencies for their outstanding work that made Cannes 2014 such an amazing showcase for our industry. The premium on big creative ideas has never been greater, but as I have said before, an idea is brilliant, only if brilliantly executed.","As I look at the talent in Omnicom, I want to specifically mention several changes, which have been announced in the past several weeks. Troy Ruhanen has become the President and the CEO of TBWA, succeeding Tom Carroll, who continues to serve as Chairman. This move demonstrates our emphasis on well thought out long-term succession planning.","Troy was identified as a potential network leader some time ago, and Tom Carroll and I decided together, that when it came time, Troy would be the right leader for TBWA. His experience in leading Omnicom agencies across geographies, disciplines and categories, makes this a seamless transition that will further enhance TBWA's capabilities and reputation.","Troy has been with Omnicom for over 10 years and is now one of five network heads with long tenures. Troy's prior role at the holding company will be assumed by Peter Sherman, who recently rejoined Omnicom from J. Walter Thompson. Peter will be working to ensure we are driving agency collaboration and innovation for our largest clients.","And in terms of our ability to attract talents from the outside, last quarter we also filled two very important and strategic positions. Alexei Orlov joined as CEO of RAPP and Emma Sergeant joined as President of DAS Europe, industry veterans with significant agency and client experience.","Having experienced network and agency leaders, who know each other well is increasingly important, because collaboration has become the new normal. The lines between disciplines have been blurred. Clients more and more want integrated solutions.","Turning now to our progress on expanding our capabilities. We made an important acquisition last quarter, the TBWA Worldwide acquiring Heimat, which is a leading, independent advertising agency in Germany. Heimat will merge with TBWA's existing operations in that market.","Also in Europe, RAPP announced its acquisition of Haygarth, a. U.K. based brand and retail agency. This is a smart transaction that will combine Haygarth's expertise in digital shopper marketing with RAPP's globally focused data insight and technology expertise.","Yesterday, Omnicom's DAS Group announced the acquisition of an interest in In Press, a leading PR company in Brazil. In Press has been an affiliate of Porter Novelli's network since 1999. As you know, Brazil is a key market for both our clients and our businesses, and formalizing this partnership will provide opportunities for growth in years ahead. In addition to these acquisitions, we continue to make internal investments in our networks, agencies and platforms.","On the topic of digital strategies, I will remind you of what I said in our last call, about the way Omnicom breaks down the broad category of digital. First, we've always believed that anything that can be digital, will be, and that means pretty much everything we do.","We have long encouraged and helped our agencies to invest in digital skill sets and talent, and they all have. Whether in brand advertising, shopper marketing, PR or any of our disciplines, all of our agencies have developed and hired talent to embed digital capabilities in our core offerings.","Second is an area of data and analytics. New platforms that enable market as to identify and reach the right people at the right time in the right place, and even when they are in the right frame of mind. For us that's analytic, with more than 1,200 professionals in 45 markets. Analytic is the resource for all Omnicom companies.","Third, is an area of technology-driven marketing, such as e-commerce and m-commerce, where firms like the Lloyd, IBM, Wipro, and agencies like Sapient compete. We have some capabilities in this area and we see it as a potential opportunity for further growth.","Looking at analytic, we distinguish its capabilities by forming global relationships with major technology and media companies, rather than making bets on specific platforms. And we continue to be the first movers in employing the latest media, technology, data and e-commerce tools through more than a 100 partnership agreements, where we are levering on behalf of our agencies.","Last quarter, Omnicom signed a first of its kind agreement with Twitter. There are at least three important features with this agreement. First, it gives first look to Omnicom's creative teams, a format being developed by Twitter. Second, it provides design and strategic collaborations from Twitter for all of Omnicom's agencies.","And finally, it integrates Twitter's recently acquired mobile ad exchange, MoPub with Accuen. I mentioned at the beginning of the call that one of the main drivers of Omnicom's second quarter performance was our media operations, which includes search, social and programmatic trading.","For Omnicom, those capabilities are captured within Annalect. Over the last three-and-a-half years Annalect has produced game-changing tools in the area of analytics and built one of the industry's larger data management platforms.","They have also assembled a talented team of data scientist from other industry fields. Some of these analysts are now being deployed within our advertising network, so it's BBDO working directly with our account teams and clients. And to further deliver on this front, Annalect recently hired a Chief Analytics Officer, who will expand our data science practice across Omnicom.","Before handing the call over to Randy, I'll close it by saying, it was a solid quarter for Omnicom on all fronts. We posted the strongest organic growth we have had in quite a while, and we're on track to meet or 2014 revenue and margin target. Our buybacks have been resumed and we've increased our dividend.","I said recently that Omnicom is strong, innovative, energized and ready for the future, and that is certainly the way we feel this morning, based upon our second quarter results. I want to thank all the people at Omnicom; our many stakeholders, who have supported us along the way; and our very, very important and supportive clients.","And with that, I'll turn this over to Randy, and then he and I will be available for questions after. Thank you.","Randall Weisenburger","Thank you. As John pointed out in his comments, our agencies have done a great job and are on a good track. Over the course of the last year, they've remained laser focused on serving the need to their clients, and they've continued to make excellent progress against both their strategic and operational objectives. And as you can see, they've again delivered excellent financial results.","Revenue for the quarter came in at $3.87 billion, up 6.4%. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by very strong organic growth of 5.8%. And for the first time in 10 quarters, FX was positive, at least from a revenue perspective. I'll go into more detail on our revenue growth in a few minutes.","Moving down to P&L. First, I want to point out that we've now fully recognized all of the expenses related to the terminated merger. During the quarter, the pre-tax cost, which were predominantly professional fees, totaled $1.8 million. For the six months, the total is about $8.8 million.","In addition, for tax purposes, after the termination, we were able to deduct any previously capitalized cost associated with the merger. As a result, this quarter, we realized an $11 million tax benefit.","The net EPS benefit this quarter was about $0.03 per share and for the six months it's about $0.01. Because these numbers are not significant and they're behind us, we've eliminated the non-GAAP presentation, we've shown for the past few quarters.","Back to the P&L. EBITDA increased 4.7% to $574 million in the quarter and resulting EBITDA margin was 14.8%, down about 25 basis points from last year. The decline in margins was due primarily to three things. First, although FX this quarter was positive for revenue, it had about a 10 basis point negative impact on operating margins.","In several of our larger higher-margin markets, primarily Australia, Brazil, Canada and Russia, FX was very negative and negatively impacted our margins. Also in the U.K., where we have much of our European corporate infrastructure, while FX was positive to revenue, it also inflated those corporate costs, again hurting our margins.","In addition to FX, our margins were hurt to some extent by our mix of business in the quarter. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, we had approximately $1.8 million of cost related to the merger in the quarter.","When we analyzed our businesses unit-by-unit in their local currencies, in aggregate, operating margins showed modest improvement year-on-year. Operating income or EBIT performed similarly. It was up about 4.9% for the quarter to $548 million and our EBIT margin was down by 20 basis points.","Turning to Page 2, and looking at the items below operating income. First, net interest expense for the quarter was $33.7 million, down $7 million year-over-year and down $5.3 million from the first quarter. The decrease in net interest expense is primarily related to the benefits we are realizing from the fixed to floating interest rates swaps we entered into, related to our 2022 senior notes, which we executed early in the second quarter.","We had gotten to the point, where virtually all of our debt structure was fixed rate. With this change, we're now about 25% floating rate and we are evaluating, moving closer to a 50-50 structure by yearend.","Our quarterly reported tax rate of 31.1% reflects the impact of approximately an $11 million tax benefit we recognized in the quarter related to the previously incurred merger expenses, which will require to be capitalized for tax purposes prior to the termination of the merger.","Our underlying operating tax rate continues to be about 33.2%. And while we're always looking for ways to improve the efficiency of our tax structure, given where we are currently, we expect our operating tax rate for the year to stay around 33.1% or 33.2%.","Earnings from our affiliates increased $1.1 million in the quarter to $4 million and the allocations of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less-than-fully-owned subsidiaries also increased $1.1 million to $33.2 million. As a result, net income increased 12.3% to $325 million.","On Slide 3, we show the allocation of net income to participating securities, which are the unvested restricted shares held by our employees. The remaining net income available for common shareholders increased 13.2% for the quarter to $319 million.","This chart also shows our diluted share count. As you know, we restarted our share buyback program in mid-May. In the quarter, we bought back about 7.9 million shares net. But since we didn't start buying until midway through the quarter, the share buyback is not yet fully reflected in the weighted average share count.","As a result, the share count for the quarter is down only marginally year-over-year. Given our overall strong performance in the quarter and the $0.03 per share benefit I mentioned earlier, EPS increased about 13% to a $1.33.","On Slides 4, 5 and 6, we present the P&L information for the six months to date. To save some time, I'll just give a few highlights. On Page 4, revenue was up about 4.8%, driven predominantly by organic growth. EBITA increased about 4% to $981 million and our EBITA margin was 13.3%, down about 10 basis points.","Included in EBIT is about $8.8 million of merger related costs, which brought margins down about 10 basis points and FX negatively impacted margins by another 10 basis points. The underlying operating margin year-over-year was actually up about 10 basis points.","On Page 5, net interest expense for the six months is down $9 million, primarily due to the interest rate swaps we completed in Q2 as well as good cash performance. The reported tax rate was 32.2% brought down by the $11 million tax benefit I mentioned. And equity and affiliate income was down $1.5 million and the minority interest allocation was up $4 million. This all resulted in net income increasing 7.3% to $531 million.","On Page 6, you can see the weighted average share count is flat and EPS increased 8% to $2 per share. On Slide 7, we start reviewing our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX. While, overall it was positive, it was very mixed. On a year-over-year basis, the dollar weakened against both the euro and U.K. pound, however, it strengthened against the currencies in a number of our other significant markets, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Russia and South Africa.","The net result increased our revenue for the quarter by $26 million or about seventh-tenth of a percent. Looking ahead, if FX rates stay where they are currently, we expect FX to be positive to revenue by about a 125 basis points in Q3 and by about 26 basis points in Q4.","Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by $5 million. Fortunately, we've now cycled through the Q2 2013 sale of a recruitment marketing business. And with the transactions that we've completed through June 30, we currently expect acquisitions net of dispositions to add about 50 basis points to our revenue in both the third and fourth quarters.","And most importantly, organic revenue growth was positive $213 million or 5.8% this quarter. It was a strong quarter with positive growth across each of our disciplines and most of our major markets, with the exceptions being France and Canada. The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included excellent performance across our immediate business driven by both new business wins and the continuing development of new media.","Also, our agencies in the emerging markets continue to perform very well. This quarter we had excellent performance in Brazil, China, Columbia, India, Malaysia and Russia. And we continue to see very modest recovery in Europe.","Slide 8 covers the year-to-date results, which are basically in line with the quarter. Slide 9 shows our mix of business for the quarter, which again was split about evenly between advertising and marketing services. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising was up 10.5% driven as I mentioned by the excellent performance of our media businesses and marketing services was up 1.5%.","Within marketing services, CRM was up 1.1%, with mixed results across businesses, mostly driven by individual agency performance. Public relations was up a very solid 4.1%, and specialty communications was up about 20 basis points. However, the underlying performance looks generally good. We're just up against the difficult comp number from last year in our healthcare businesses, which had growth of almost 10%.","Flipping to Slides 10 and 11, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split was 57% for North America, 29% Europe, 10% Asia-Pacific, with the remaining business split between Latin America, and Africa and the Middle East.","Turning to the details on Slide 11. In North America, we had organic revenue growth of 7.9%, driven this quarter by the performance of our media and PR businesses. Our other major regions all had positive organic growth as well. Europe was up 2.1%, led by continuing strong performance in the U.K. and Russia. Solid performance in Germany, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, and as I mentioned France continued to struggle.","Asia-Pac was up 5.1%. We had strong performances across most of the region, with Australia, China, India, Malaysia and South Korea leading the way. Latin America was up 7.8%, again led by strong double-digit performance in both Brazil and Columbia. And Africa and the Middle East was up 2%.","On Slide 12, we present our mix of business by industry sector. Keep it in mind, these are year-to-date figures and are total growth, not just organic growth. As you can see, the larger changes year-over-year were in our retail, telecom and other industries group. The retail sector increased on the strength of new business wins over the past few quarters. And within other, we've benefited from both new business wins as well as increased spending from our services, multi-industry conglomerate and government clients.","Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 13. First of all, it was a pretty good quarter. We generated almost $760 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital during the first six months of the year.","As for our primary uses of cash, on Slide 14, dividends paid to our common shareholders was $212 million. This was up significantly from last year, when we paid our normal Q1 dividend in the fourth quarter of 2012, and it reflects the recent increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.50 a share.","Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders increased with performance and FX changes to $66.5 million. Capital expenditures of $92 million was up about $23 million from the same period last year. The increase is a combination of timing differences and a couple of larger office relocations during the period. Acquisitions, including earnout payments, net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $105 million.","And finally, stock repurchases net of the proceeds we received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $554 million. As I mentioned earlier, we restarted our share program in mid-May and have so far purchased about 7.9 million shares net. As a result of all of that, we outspent our free cash flow by about $270 million for the six months.","Turning to Slide 15, focusing first on our capital structure. As of June 30, it remains effectively unchanged compared to last year. But as you may be aware, in June, we called our convertible notes for redemption at the end of July. Our net-net position at the end of the quarter was $2.5 billion, an improvement of about $120 million from last year.","Our total debt to EBITDA ratio at the end of June stands at 1.9x and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.2x. And due to both, the decrease in our interest expense and the increase in EBITDA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 11.2x.","On Slide 16, you can see, we again delivered excellent returns on both total invested capital and common equity. While both return figures were impacted by the suspension of our share repurchase program over the last year, we remained very strong with return on invested capital of 16.9% and return on equity of 31.5%.","And finally, on Slide 17, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from fiscal 2004 through June 30 of this year. That totaled $9.4 billion. And the bar show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and the net share repurchases, the sum of which during that same period totaled $10.1 billion for cumulative payout ratio of just over 107%. And now that concludes our prepared remarks.","There are a number of other supplemental slides included in the presentation materials for your review, but at this point we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question today comes from the line of David Bank representing RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","There are two quick ones. First I think in the very beginning of your commentary you had said that you felt like you were on track for your full year revenue growth and margin targets. Could you remind us of what it is you're on track for? And then the second question is, kind of more big picture, as you look across the landscape now, especially having a hard time to contemplate, I think the contrast in business mix with you guys in Publicis, but if you look more broadly to all of your competition, how would you say your business mix differs from other major players in the landscape? And how does that impacts margin performance, both sort of near-term and longer-term.","Randall Weisenburger","I think we started the year telling people that we expected organic growth to be in the 4% to 4.5% range for the full year. We do think it bounced around a little bit. And we said, flat to up 10 basis points in margins, I think right now we certainly think from an operations or efficiency standpoint that our companies are making all the right moves and the underlying operating performance is there.","The FX headwind is tougher than we expected starting the year. So if you wait a week, FX will change, which way it changes I am not sure, but if it stays where it's at, flat margins will be probably the better end of what we can achieve given that FX impact. We also had $8.8 million in these numbers of merger expenses, going through that isn't something that we were contemplating, we were saying flat to up 10 basis points of margins, either.","Your second question was mix. Every one has got a little bit of, obviously different mix. It's hard to know exactly what the revenues or margins from each of the different businesses people have are. Certainly WPP has a fairly large research business that I don't think any of us has of that type or magnitude. They have a large media business. Publicis has a large media business. We have a large media business, but on a relative scale, that would be a smaller percentage of our business, than say it would be for Publicis, not a 100% sure from a WPP standpoint. We think it would be a bigger percentage.","We have I think much larger field marketing and marketing services businesses, things in the area of branding, field marketing, events, promotions, those sorts of things. I'm not sure from an IPG standpoint, the relative size of those businesses and its mix. I know ours is quite a bit larger than Publicis or WPPs.","Everyone talks about digital, we tend not to. We don't actually think digital is a so called business. Digital was a medium or a technology that we want every one of our businesses, irrespective of their underlying discipline to be utilized and to figure out how to provide a better service to their clients and to grow their revenues. That that probably covers it, I think.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets","And anything about the near-term business mix that would make sort of margin performance different from the peer group or those all sort of more broader, bigger picture, longer-term issues, or you know contrasts?","Randall Weisenburger","Well, business mix can move your margins around a little bit. It affected us a little bit this quarter. It all depends on which business is doing well. I'd say one of the reasons that I have told people that we're focused more on margin dollars than margin percentages, if we have a company that comes in that can win a client, win the next $100 million piece of business, that's going to generate $6 million or $7 million of operating income, if it doesn't require capital, that's something that we wouldn't say, don't do it. We think that would be very positive for shareholders, very positive for our business overall.","If we were focused only on margins that would be a piece of business that would be dilutive to our reported margins and the natural outcome of that would be to not pursue that business, even though it's economically very accretive to shareholders. So that's not been our focus. We want each of our businesses to be as efficient as possible, and to grow their businesses economically for all of our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","Just a couple of questions. My first question is on the impressive organic revenue growth you guys saw in the quarter. I know you gave a lot of detail what was behind it and I appreciate that. But if you were to pinpoint, I guess, what was the delta this quarter to give it, the best quarter you've seen in several years as you highlighted it, I guess what was different this quarter?","Randall Weisenburger","I'd say a few things and John can comment too, if he wants later. First is less negatives. So most of our businesses did fairly well, so we didn't have a lot of, I'll say headwinds in any one spot. So that's always a plus. Our media businesses did very well. A lot of that is some new business wins that happened last year in the third and the fourth quarter, and some this year in the first quarter. So that rolling through was very helpful.","Our Accuen is doing well. That was up I think $30 million or $40 million year-over-year. So that's a business that, it's kind of I'll say, a new-ish business. It's been around I guess for a couple of years, but is starting to have more attraction, as is everyone's, and ours is doing quite well. We think our technology is very good and industry-leading.","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","Just a follow-up question then on Europe. You've seen some better performance in Continental Europe. Maybe France continues to be real negative, I think its sorts of an industry-wide issue. I guess, how much are you dependent on that stabilizing or can you continue to see better performance or some signs of recovery, further signs of recovery in Europe with the trends still staying weak?","John Wren","This is John, Alexia. I think Europe, we're pleased that it's stable to flat from what we see right now. We're not expecting any grand move from there. There is no one country that's going to lead all to us, one country that's going to lead Europe out of this current malaise that it's in, in reverse, we don't see anything backing up beyond what we've already seen.","Randall Weisenburger","And critical is individual agency performance. Agency even in a difficult market, goes out, wins a few clients, comes up with innovative ideas for their clients, and they're going to be able to drive their topline revenue. So that we can't loose track of that, obviously economic headwinds make it more difficult, but the individual agencies need to perform. And fortunately ours has been doing a pretty good job.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","I have two questions. I guess my first one is that, appreciate the new revenue regional breakdown you guys gave. I was just wondering when will you be making available perhaps back to sort of beginning of last year on quarterly basis of those breakdowns, just so we can all update our models for that? Will there be an 8-K going up soon on that?","Randall Weisenburger","I wasn't planning on it. Let me try to pull the numbers together and see what we can do.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","It would just be very helpful I think for everybody. I've had a number of questions this morning from analyst out there.","Randall Weisenburger","Okay.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","And then also just you've mentioned what the net share buyback was in the quarter. Just wondering what was the gross amount of shares that you guys bought back in the quarter, please?","John Wren","8,031,000, plus I think there was 147,000 shares that we effectively bought, if I am reading this right, for the exercise for -- basically with holding taxes on the exercise of restricted stock. So it's effectively bought in. They weren't open market purchases really.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","And then also just talk on the revenue breakdown. You mentioned, U.K. was up I guess mid-single digits organically. What was the euro on the old basis if you have it, the euro-denominated markets, just so we can compare to what people were estimating in the quarter?","John Wren","I don't have it, sorry.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","And then lastly, John, if I could ask you, you mentioned a bunch of internal investments that you guys were doing here, which is ongoing theme with Omnicom for many years, obviously. Is there anything you'd want to highlight that you're doing differently here on the internal investments that you can talk with us about, please?","John Wren","Well, we're following very much the patterns and making similar investments as we've made for at least the last eight, 10 quarters. We spend a lot of money on education, development of our people and that spread throughout the globe now in a fairly consistent basis. There is a lot of investing that's going on in Annalect and all the associated digital capabilities that we're increasingly able to do. And I see that is something we will only continue and increase as time goes past, because we're spreading those tools and that capability into the creative departments of our various agencies at this point.","Randall Weisenburger","In another way, worth mention is the eg+ platform.","John Wren","Production and digital.","Randall Weisenburger","That will be -- it is off to a great start. It will be, I predict, a fairly high growth area over the next several years.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Julien Roch representing Barclays.","Julien Roch - Barclays","The first one is on revenue. WPP has moved from reporting all, telling us to focus on revenue to gross margin, because of the proprietary revenue they're taking on with Xaxis. And this morning, Publicis said there was $17 million to $18 million of principle revenue in their numbers. I was wondering whether there is some of that in your revenue, if we could get a number or if it is actually zero. That's my first question.","The second question on the very good Q2 organic, I know you said it was due to individual agency performance, to your focus on technology, but Publicis had a pretty dire quarter. And when you look at what Interpublic has reported, what WPP and Accuen are supposed to report, clearly everybody is taking market share from Publicis this quarter. So do you feel there's a bit of your revenue lines coming from that is my second question?","And then the third question is on share buyback. Historically, you're doing all of your cash flow in buybacks and dividend. You have other spend last quarter to catch up the pools, due to the merger. So could we get a sense of -- I mean what quarters will you have spend and kind of the run rate of buyback for the coming quarters?","Randall Weisenburger","Let me take a shot at that.","John Wren","Sure. Go ahead.","Randall Weisenburger","So first of all, we obviously all report in accordance with GAAP or IFRS. I think they are reasonably consistent on the points. So if we end up taking principal position, basically buy an asset that we're reselling to a client, we'll need to take it on a principle basis. I don't fully understand everyone else's business. I did hear what WPP said. I have not yet heard what Publicis said. The WPP numbers for Xaxis, again, I don't fully understand everything that's there.","I think our business that's like that as Accuen, and as I mentioned in my comments, Accuen is doing very well, year-over-year growth was about $40 million for us. How much of that you'd attribute to, in services or just the media cost, because the way it makes its money is it buys media and sells it. So it's obviously, its service intact is embedded in that number, but that year-over-year growth number is about $40 million for us.","I am probably skipping questions too, because I don't remember exactly what it was. But I remember the share buyback question. What we told people coming out in I guess mid-May is that we were going to resume our share buyback. We wanted to refocus that our first priority is to pay a solid dividend. We've been increasing our dividend fairly substantially over the last several years, we did it again.","We're up to just shy of probably $500 million a year of dividends. We want to make all of the acquisitions that we can that are accretive for our shareholders that are on strategy for Omnicom to build our business for the long-term. And then the balance, we're going to balance out our capital structure with share buybacks.","We had accumulated quite a bit of cash during the period that we were not buying in stock. So we estimated that we buy about 1.25 billion of shares by the end of the first quarter of 2015. So we have made a lot of progress towards that this quarter with $550 million or so. We didn't say, the specific timing of how fast we would do that, we'll obviously keep track of it and stay focused on our overall business.","John Wren","Second question had to do specifically with Publicis. And plus we've won a lot of business this past quarter, I don't believe Publicis is where we have gotten it from. I think our wins really have come from Interpublic and from WPP and that's where the growth and expansion has come out of. Some of it hasn't been announced yet either. It will get announced shortly, but that's principally where it's been.","Julien Roch - Barclays","Again, just if you can refer upon Accuen, and thank you very much for giving the $40 million figure. But you had said everybody is doing it differently. And you said, you don't fully understand what exactly it's been doing. So on this business, the $40 million of revenue is something you take and then you buy and sell to clients. So I assume that you make no margin on that $40 million, or you just make the normal margin on what would have been the all commission, so say, 5% of $40 million and then a $0.15 margin on that. So is that correct?","Randall Weisenburger","No, the business is a little bit different than that. We're taking ownership of media. We're placing a principal -- I want to say bet, but principal bet. We are buying specific media and we are reselling that at a hopefully an increased price in most circumstances since the profit that we make, our revenue or our return is going to be based upon the difference between that purchase price of media and the sale price of media. Well, we then have to provide all of the services, all of the underlying technology, build the platforms, do the insights and take the risk.","So it's a little bit of a different business model than straight agency-type model. And again, I think everyone is accounting for that is probably pretty similar. I don't know if there is a difference in IFRS and GAAP. The size of people's businesses or how they specifically trade that, that's business-by-business.","John Wren","I think there are some pretty vast differences. They are small numbers, first of all, at this point, but there is some vast differences in the way. I think WPP approaches it versus us. In our case, it's an opt-in, it's not all of our clients, it's only the clients that choose to participate in it.","I even think one of our competitors has an independent sales force and is going out and trying to resell inventory that it might own to non-clients, other agencies in some cases. So at this point, it's early days, this business isn't fully developed, and we're just reporting what we did. So I don't know that you can draw a straight line and compare all the groups at this moment.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of William Bird with FBR.","William Bird - FBR","John, you talked a bit about some of your businesses that are seeing high client demand like Accuen. I was wondering if you could talk about, maybe some of the other services that are currently in greatest demand, particularly by those clients that tend to lead the ad market? And then, Randy, I was wondering if you could just talk about salary trends, the negative leverage in the quarter, and what you expect going forward?","John Wren","Well, the clearest businesses in terms of media growth that we have are the media and media-related activities, and that's because of the complexity of the marketplace and the changing channels. I see that only increasing in the near-term, as share of budgets and clients goes to video display versus where it's being spent now, which is a more traditional TV in some cases.","So in the near-term there'll be greater media growth there. Also the other trend is clients, as evidenced in Nissan United, are looking for increasing help in us taking responsibility for simplifying a complex marketplace in order for them to achieve their goals and objectives.","And so there are shifts going on within the business, realignment of some of the activities, some of the ways we approach and we administer activities. So those are the two principles for us at the moment. And then, the healthcare industry, separately, as an industry, has been very active.","Randall Weisenburger","Your negative leverage question. We didn't have negative leverage in the quarter. Obviously, on an aggregated basis, the margins were down. I went through this. Three primary drivers to that; first was FX; second was the merger cost that we went through; and then, third was mix.","The statement I made is that if we actually go agency-by-agency, so we basically like-to-like in the common currency, margins were up a little bit, not a significant amount, but 4 basis points or 5 basis points at least. So from a salary leverage standpoint, we did not have negative salary leverage in the quarter.","Operator","Next we'll go to line of James Dix with Wedbush Securities.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities","Just one question, honestly, and following up a little bit on what you called out, John. I mean, I assume if you looked at your clients and you looked at their medium mix over time, it's been shifting to be a little bit more towards setting large digital platforms in a way from setting the traditional ones. Are you seeing any change in the rate of that trend, if you look at that medium mix, in particular for search, social and programmatic that those channels which you called out? And if you're seeing a change in trend there, do you think that's having any impact on the spending that's going to your media agencies, who you've called out is having particularly strong growth?","John Wren","The answer is, I believe, it is. Can I pinpoint it or predict it with any grand accuracy, no. In speaking to my media leadership, they believe more and more the shift is now permanent and it's only going to increase, as we're able to measure and increasingly measure results. And there is a lot of chatter in clients in terms of a desire to spend more money in this area. But we haven't seen a wholesale move.","You know, what we've seen is the same trend that has been developing for the past several years, just continuing. But everybody is working in it every single day. There is going to be an increasing shift. I don't know if that's helpful, but truly what we see at the moment.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities","And you specifically, previously called out the visual, video display versus traditional TV. I mean is that part of the shift that you think is -- ","Randall Weisenburger","Yes, that's going on. Facebook is getting a lot smarter. Every one of the key players getting more competitive offering, different ways to do things, which are proving to be effective.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities","And I guess, my second part of the question is just, do you think that's having an impact on the spending that's going to your media agencies, on the fees or other types of revenue streams you're getting there?","Randall Weisenburger","I mean the amount of work that goes into some of these, I'll say, newer mediums is a greater amount of labor. Our agencies are generally getting paid for insights and creativity. The less of the executions they're doing is much broader, because of all these different mediums. The complexity of these new mediums is higher. So the labor required and the insights required is more.","We're kind of at a stage that I think people need to be careful about on a longer-term basis. These are new mediums that are finding their spot in the world as a very useful medium. The old mediums, the traditional mediums, are also very useful for their right spot. So the breadth of opportunity is increasing, but I'm not sure anything is getting eliminated. They're just being utilized differently.","So inevitably with anything new, you're going to see a very rapid growth period, once people find out it's appropriate use, but then it should level off at some point in time, whether that's a year from now or five years from now or 10 years from now. It's impossible to say because, frankly, new valuable uses of each of these new mediums is coming along everyday, as smart people with great creative ideas and insights figure out more and more ways to utilize it.","Randall Weisenburger","And thank you, everyone, for taking the time to listen to our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and using the AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect."],"16318":["Omnicom Group Inc.

Please go ahead.","Shub Mukherjee","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our second quarter 2019 earnings call. On the call with me today is John Wren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Philo Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer. We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release. We have posted to www.omnicomgroup.com this morning\u2019s press release along with the presentation covering the information that we will review this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I\u2019ve been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statement and other information that we have included at the end of our presentation, and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectation and that actual events or results may differ materially. I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom\u2019s performance.

Good morning. I\u2019m pleased to speak to you this morning about our second quarter results. We had another good quarter with organic growth of 2.8%, which is in line with our internal targets. Total revenue was down 3.6% due to the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and acquisitions net of dispositions. EBIT margin was 15.4%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the prior year, and EPS for the quarter was up 5% to $1.68 per share.","The results continue to demonstrate consistency and diversity of Omnicom\u2019s operations, our ability to deliver consumer-centric strategic business solutions to our clients, and our best-in-industry creative talent combined with market-leading digital data and analytical expertise. ","Organic growth in the quarter was broad-based across our agencies, disciplines and client sectors. Looking first across disciplines, advertising and media was up 4.4% with both advertising and media practices experiencing good growth in the quarter. CRM consumer experience was up 1.9%. Our precision marketing and digital agencies had double-digit growth in the quarter. This growth was offset by negative performance in our events business, which had difficult comps as compared to the prior year. As expected, CRM execution and support was down 2.6%. Healthcare continues to be one of our best performing practice areas with growth of 8.4%. Omnicom health group has the top agencies in the world serving the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries and the group is very well positioned for continued growth, and PR was down 1.3% in the quarter. ","Turning now to our performance by geography, the U.S. was up 3.2% in the quarter driven by strong results in advertising and media, healthcare, and our precision marketing group, offset by declines in our events business and in CRM execution and support. Beyond the U.S., the North American region primarily consisting of Canada was up 11.8% in the quarter. The U.K. was 5.7%. Our agencies in the U.K. had solid results across advertising and media, healthcare, precision marketing and PR, offset by declines in our CRM execution and support business. Overall growth in the euro and non-euro region was 1.5%.","In the euro markets, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, performed well. France had negative growth as it continued to be impacted by the loss of a specialty print production client. This impact will not cycle out until the first quarter of 2020. Our events businesses in France also had a negative performance due to difficult comps versus 2018. In the non-euro markets, the Czech Republic, Russia and Switzerland had better than average growth.","Asia Pacific organic growth was 1.9% led by New Zealand and Japan. China had negative growth. Latin America was down 2.4% primarily due to the continuing challenges we face in Brazil. While we took several actions in the first half of 2019 to rationalize our operations in Brazil, we expect 2019 will continue to be a difficult year. ","Our smallest region, the Middle East and Africa, was down 8.3%. Lastly, as Phil will discuss in more detail during his remarks, in early July we issued \u20ac1 billion in both eight and 12-year bonds at very attractive interest rates of 1.2%. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our performance this quarter.","Omnicom\u2019s success is ground in our steady focus on our growth strategies. We continue to hire and develop the best talent in the industry with a fundamental commitment to creativity and diversity. We remain focused on relentlessly pursuing organic growth by expanding our service offerings to our existing clients and winning new business, continuing to invest in high growth areas and opportunities through internal initiatives and acquisitions, and we remain vigilant on driving efficiencies throughout our organization, increasing EBIT and shareholder value.","Let me now discuss what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace and how our strategies enable us to sustain our financial performance.","Having recently returned from the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity, a key takeaway was the return to celebrating creativity as the most sought after force in our industry. Before I speak about our creative IP, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes on the tools we\u2019ve built to support our creators.","In 2009 we launched Analect, our core data analytics and insights group with the responsibility for consolidating and developing our data and tech stacks. Analect was established to deliver more effective and targeted media for our clients. It has been instrumental in enhancing the services and capabilities of our media business over the years. ","Last year, we took another step forward when Analect launched our people-based precision marketing and insights platform, called Omni. Omni provides data and analytics, cultural insights, content inspiration, and tech tools to inform powerful and connected brand strategies orchestrated across every touch point, whether it\u2019s marketing, sales or service, and through all media. These tools are developed to empower our people to derive better outcomes and results for their clients, and they are available across our media, creative and CRM agencies. ","Importantly, our data and analytics strategy is focused on three areas. First is ensuring that the platforms remain open. We prefer to rent the right data and technology that can improve our agility and client integration at any point in time, rather that invest in legacy data assets and platforms that can easily become obsolete. Second, we are making selective, focused investments to develop and integrate differentiated tools in one place in support of the services our agencies offer, and last, we have prioritized these capabilities in our key markets.","While we have been and remain keenly focused on the importance of data analytics and technology, we also realize they can only take us so far. Our investment in data and analytics has been made with the understanding that they are tools in service of creativity and content. As I\u2019ve said before, our true source of differentiation, our IP, is our ability to bring deep consumer insights to our clients in lockstep with brilliant creative ideas driving business results. We are delivering on this promise by continuing to invest in our agency brands. ","Omnicom was founded by creators. Creativity which is in our DNA is bred through deep culture that must be nurtured over time, in our case, since our formation. It is not something that can be acquired or sold. We have also encouraged our agencies to maintain their unique positioning and go-to-market strategies. This differentiation attracts top talent and leads to breakthrough ideas and results for our clients. ","Our creativity supported by data and insights was a key reason for Omnicom\u2019s success at the annual Cannes Lions Festival. For the second consecutive year, we were named Holding Company of the Year with approximately 123 of our agencies across 35 countries winning over 200 lions. Speaking to the strength of our individual brands, all three of our creative networks - DVB, BBDO, and TBWA, placed in the top five of Network of the Year category.","In addition, we were extremely pleased to have Jeff Goodby and Rich Silverstein, founders of Goodby, Silverstein and Partners, receive this year\u2019s Lion of St. Mark Award. As the Chairman of Cannes Lions said, this award was given to Jeff and Rich because of their profound influence not only in creating groundbreaking work but also inspiring others to create great work too. It was a proud moment to see their legacy recognized.","One of TBWA\u2019s longest standing clients, Apple, was also honored this year at Cannes as the 2019 Creative Marketer of the Year. This award recognizes an organization that demonstrates sustained creative excellence and distinguishes itself by embracing collaboration between partners and agencies to produce truly outstanding creative campaigns. Cannes Lions is just one example of how our agencies excelled this quarter.","Let me just mention a few other recent highlights of how our agencies were recognized around the globe. At the 2019 One Show Awards, Omnicom was named Creative Holding Company of the Year and DVB was named Network of the Year. FleishmanHillard was named Large Agency of the Year at the 2019 Sabre Awards. At this year\u2019s D&AD Pencil of the Year, DVB was ranked number one network of the year with BBDO coming in at number two. At the 2019 ADC Awards, TBWA was named Network of the Year, and for ad agency A-lists, both Goodby, Silverstein and Partners and TBWA were honored in the top five. These awards reflect our outstanding creativity and talent.","People drive our business success whether they are pitching new business, helping our clients to create powerful brands, designing interactive web experiences, or planning multi-platform media campaigns. We support them with a diverse inclusive environment that nurtures their creative energy. This means diversity in backgrounds, race, gender, age, and experience. Omnicom\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with our board of directors. I\u2019m proud to report that Omnicom was recently recognized by Fortune Magazine as only one of six Fortune 500 companies that have more women than men on its board of directors. ","At a broader level, Omnicom was part of history last month as a platinum sponsor of the first ever World Pride Celebration in New York City, which also marked the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising. Working closely with New York City Pride, several Omnicom agencies joined forces to provide branding and PR work for this year\u2019s celebration, including Interbrand, RAP, Siegel+Gale, TBWA, World Health, Harrison and Star, FleishmanHillard, Ketchum, Porter Novelli, and Rx Mosaic. It was an incredible team effort with planning and execution taking place over the course of two years. We\u2019re proud to celebrate our LGBTQ employees and show support for the greater community the best way we know how - through our work.","In summary, we made significant strides in changing our services capability and organization to better serve our clients while always staying true to our commitment to creativity. We are pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter, which continued to reflect the benefits of our strategies. As we move into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to deliver on our internal targets for the full year 2019. ","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?","Phil Angelastro","Thank you John, and good morning. As John said, results for the second quarter of 2019 were in line with our expectations. Our operating results continue to be drive by outstanding client service provided by our agencies and net new business wins, along with positive impact that our efficiency initiatives have had on our cost structure and the benefits from the change in mix resulting from our repositioning actions.","For the second quarter, organic revenue growth totaled 2.8% or $108 million. The continued strength of the U.S. dollar over the past 12 months created an FX headwind, reducing our reported revenue by $100 million or 2.6%. The reduction in revenue from dispositions made during the last 12 months primarily in our CRM execution and support discipline exceeded revenue from acquisitions in the quarter. As a result, our second quarter revenue was reduced by $148 million or about 3.8%. In total, our reported revenue decreased 3.6% to $3.7 billion in the quarter. We will discuss the drivers of the changes in revenue in more detail in a few minutes.","Turning to the income statement items below revenue, our Q2 operating profit, or EBIT, was $574 million with a resulting operating margin of 15.4%, which was up 30 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2018, and our EBITDA for the quarter was $595 million, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 16%, up 20 basis points compare to last year\u2019s Q2. We continue to see benefits from the change in business mix resulting from the disposition of several non-strategic or underperforming agencies over the past year. We also continue to seek out opportunities to increase operational efficiency throughout our organization focused on our real estate, back office services, procurement, and IT support services. These actions continue to positively impact our operating performance.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $50.2 million, down $2.3 million compared to the second quarter of 2018 and up $4.2 million versus Q1 of this year. Interest expense on our debt increased $2.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus Q2 of 2018. This was driven by higher rates on our fixed to floating interest rate swaps which were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to a reduction in commercial paper activity compared to the prior year.","As you may recall, this past February we issued \u20ac520 million of zero percent short term senior notes in a private placement to an investor outside the United States. Those notes will mature in August of 2019. As a result, we\u2019ve been able to reduce our other short-term borrowing needs, including our commercial paper issuances, which lowered our interest expense year-over-year. The reduction in commercial paper activity relative to 2018 is expected to continue through the maturity of the notes next month. ","Interest income increased $2.5 million versus Q2 of 2018 as a result of an increase in our cash balances available for investment at our treasury centers. When compared to Q1 of 2019, interest expense increased $3.6 million primarily due to commercial paper borrowings during Q2 compared to no CP borrowings during Q1 of 2019. Additionally, interest income from our treasury center activities decreased versus Q1. ","As you are aware, in early July we took steps to refinance some of our debt. I will provide more details related to this later on in the presentation.","Regarding income taxes, our reported effective tax rate for the second quarter was 24.9%, lower than our projected effective tax rate for the full year 2019. The reduction during the quarter was primarily related to the net favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in various jurisdictions which resulted in the recognition of net deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2019 of approximately $11 million. We expect our effective tax rate for the third and fourth quarters to be in line with our previously estimated tax rate of 27%. ","Earnings from our affiliates was $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2019, relatively flat compare to Q2 of 2018. The allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased to $23.4 million primarily due to our disposition activity as well as the impact of FX. As a result, net income for the second quarter was $370.7 million, up 1.8% or $6.5 million when compared to the $364.2 million in Q2 of 2018. ","Now turning to Slide 2, our diluted share count for the quarter decreased 3.2% versus Q2 of last year to 220.9 million shares. As a result, our diluted EPS for the second quarter was $1.68, which is an increase of $0.08 or 5% when compared to our reported Q2 EPS for last year.","On Slides 3 and 4, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information year to date. I will give you just a few highlights. ","Organic revenue growth was 2.7% during the first six months of the year. FX translation decreased revenue by 3% and the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions reduced revenue by 3.7%, though for the year-to-date period revenue totaled $7.2 billion, a decrease of 4% compared to the first six months of 2018. EBIT totaled just over $1 billion and our year-to-date operating margin of 13.9% was up 50 basis points when compared to the first six months of 2018. Our six-month diluted EPS was $2.85 per share, which was up $0.12 or 4.4% versus the first six months of 2018. ","Turning to the components of our revenue change in the second quarter, which is detailed on Page 5, on a year-over-year basis the strengthening of the dollar continues to create a significant FX headwind in our reported revenue. The impact of changes in currency rates decreased reported revenue by $100 million or 2.6% for the quarter. As has been the case since the third quarter of 2018, the strengthening in the second quarter of 2019 was widespread. On a year-over-year basis, the dollar once again strengthened against every one of our major foreign currencies. The largest FX movements in the quarter were from the euro, the U.K. pound, the Australian dollar, Chinese Yuan, and the Brazilian real. Looking forward, if currencies stay where they currently are, the negative impact on our reported revenues is expected to be approximately 1% for the third quarter and 0.5% in the fourth quarter, resulting in a negative impact for the full year of between 1.75% and 2%. ","The impact of our recent acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by $148 million in the quarter or 3.8%, in line with the impact we\u2019d previously projected and primarily driven by the Sellbytel disposition and other actions we took from the second half of last year through the first quarter of 2019. We will cycle through the most significant of last year\u2019s dispositions by the end of this coming September. Based on transactions we\u2019ve completed to date, our current expectations are that the impact of our acquisition activity net of dispositions will continue to be negative by approximately 3% for the third quarter and 1.5% for the fourth quarter, resulting in an anticipated negative impact of 3% for the year.","Turning to organic growth, it was up $108 million for the quarter or 2.8%. By discipline for the quarter, we again saw mixed performance. Advertising and healthcare led the way with solid organic growth. Our CRM consumer experience businesses also performed well this quarter, while PR and CRM execution and support continued to lag. Geographically, our U.S. and U.K. businesses had the strongest performance. Asia and continental Europe were also positive overall, although performance was mixed with several markets facing difficult comparisons to Q2 of last year, while our two smallest regions, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa, both were negative for the quarter. ","Slide 6 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the first quarter, the split was 56% for advertising and 44% for marketing services. As for our organic growth by discipline, our advertising discipline was up 4.4%. Advertising\u2019s organic growth was led by our media businesses along with solid performances by most of our global and national advertising agencies. CRM consumer experience was up 1.9% for the quarter. Strong performance from our precision marketing group was partially offset by reductions at our events businesses, which faced difficult comparisons back to Q2 of 2018. Also within the discipline, branding saw good growth while our shopper and commerce businesses were slightly positive.","CRM execution and support continued to underperform this quarter. Positive performance by our field marketing businesses in continental Europe was more than offset by the negative performance from our merchandising and point-of-sale businesses, as well as our specialty production businesses. PR was down 1.3%. Performance in the discipline continues to be mixed by geographic region. The U.K. and Asia were positive while our U.S., continental Europe and Latin America agencies were negative. Healthcare was up 8.4%. As has been the case for the past year, growth has been well balanced across the regions these agencies operate in. ","On Slide 7, which details the regional mix of business, you can see during the quarter the split was 54% in the U.S., a bit higher than typical because of the strength of the dollar relative to the other currencies we operate in; 3% for the rest of North America, 10% in the U.K., 18% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, 3% for Latin America, and the balance from our Middle East and Africa markets. ","As for the details of our performance by region on Slide 8, organic revenue growth in the second quarter in the U.S. was 3.2%, led by our advertising and media, healthcare, and CRM consumer experience agencies. Our domestic PR agencies were down slightly while our CRM execution and support agencies had sluggish performance. Our other North American businesses were up year-on-year driven by the strength of our precision marketing and media offerings. The U.K. was positive again this quarter, up 5.7% with growth across most disciplines; however, the uncertain regarding the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU, now scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year, continues. The rest of Europe was up 1.5% organically in the quarter, though the performance was decidedly mixed by market and discipline.","In our euro markets, while Spain and Italy continued to turn in strong performances this quarter, we saw weakness in Germany and a negative performance in France. Our organic growth in Europe outside the euro zone continues to be positive. ","With many of our major markets in Asia Pacific facing difficult comps versus Q2 of 2018, organic growth was 1.9% with Japan and New Zealand having strong performances this quarter. Our greater China agencies were down organically for the quarter due to reductions in our media businesses and in our events businesses. China in particular was facing a difficult comparison to the prior period. Latin America was down 2.4% organically in the quarter due to weakness at our Brazilian agencies, which continue to face significant macroeconomic forces in the market, while Mexico was flat for the quarter. Lastly, the Middle East and Africa, which is our smallest region, was down for the quarter.","On Slide 9, we present our revenue by industry sector. In comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2019 to 2018, we continue to see a slight shift in our mix of business with an increase in the contribution of our pharma clients offset by a decrease from our technology clients, primarily as a result of the Sellbytel disposition.","Turning to our cash flow performance, which we detail starting on Slide 10, in the first half of the year we generated $814 million of free cash flow, including changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 11, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $280 million, up slightly versus the first six months of last year. The $0.05 per share increase in the quarterly dividend that was effective with the quarterly payment in April was partially offset by a reduction in common shares over the past 12 months. Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders totaled $46 million.","Capital expenditures were $49 million year-to-date, down compared to 2018 due to less leasehold improvement activity and an increase in our equipment leasing program. Acquisitions including earn-out payments totaled $34 million, a decrease when compared to this point last year, and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans increased to $524 million. All in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $120 million in the first half of 2019.","Before discussing the details of our capital structure at the end of the quarter on Slide 12, I want to review the steps we recently took related to refinancing some of our debt. On July 8, we issued \u20ac500 million of eight-year senior notes due in 2027 at an effective rate of 0.92% and we issued an additional \u20ac500 million of 12-year senior notes due in 2031 at 1.53%. Together, the euro note issuance after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses resulted in net proceeds of $1.1 billion at an average rate of 1.23%. ","Part of the proceeds were used to retire the $500 million 2019 senior notes which matured this past Monday, July 15. In addition, on July 2 we called $400 million of the 2020 senior notes for redemption on August 1. The balance of the proceed will be used for general corporate purposes. ","Our expected ongoing long-term debt portfolio will be comprised of 4 billion in dollar-denominated debt and 1 billion in euro-denominated debt. We expect interest expense for the second half of 2019 to be reduced when compared to 2018 by approximately $3 million in Q3 after recording an expected book loss on the early extinguishment of part of our 2020 notes, and by $10 million in Q4. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.6 billion, up around $1.4 billion compared to year-end December 31, 2018. The increase in net debt was a result of the typical uses of working capital, which historically are highest the first half of the year and which totaled about $1.3 billion, as well as the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $120 million. ","These increases in net debt were partially offset by the cash we received from our disposition activity of $75 million and the slightly positive effect of exchange rates on cash during the first six months of the year which increase our cash balance by about $10 million. Compared to June 30, 2018, our net debt is down approximately $340 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the positive change in operating capital during the past 12 months of approximately $205 million and the cash proceeds received from the sale of subsidiaries during the past year of $385 million. Partially offsetting these increases over the past 12 months was an overspend of our free cash flow of approximately $80 million and the negative impact of FX on our cash balances, which was also approximately $80 million. ","As for our debt ratios, they remain solid. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times, reflecting the issuance of the euro-denominated zero coupon note in Q1, while our net debt to EBITDA ratio fell to 1.1 times. Due to the year-over-year increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio decreased to 9.6 times but remains strong.","Finally on Slide 13, you can see we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. In the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio was 23.3% and our return on equity was 56.3%. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. At this point, we\u2019re going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question will come from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you so much. Just two questions. I guess first off, just following up on the ongoing improvement in the U.S. organic growth, I know it\u2019s kind of nitpicking, it\u2019s not necessarily the way you guys look at it, but if you have some color you can give us on whether you think the improvement is really driven by the better influx or better mix of new business wins, less losses, or are you really seeing some underlying improvement at your agencies or in existing client spend?","John Wren","You said you had a second question?","Alexia Quadrani","I do. You want me to ask it now?","John Wren","Yes, go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","It\u2019s just on international. You gave great color - thank you, John - about the different regions in the quarter, and I think you mentioned that Brazil, for example, would be a challenge for the rest of the year. I\u2019m curious if you have any other color you can add about the outlook of the other major regions, how we should look to the other major regions for the back half of the year.","John Wren","Okay. In terms of U.S. organic growth, you\u2019re absolutely right - we do not look at it on a quarterly basis. We look at it across the year and what we expect clients to spend, because money can shift from quarter to quarter and when you\u2019re in the 2 to 3% growth range, those shifts have a meaningful impact on the percentages that we report. We had a solid performance. I mean, I think contributing to it was where clients decided to spend and some of the new business wins from last year, but there is not--I can\u2019t point out any one obvious reason for the particular growth that we reported. Phil might have a--?","Phil Angelastro","Yes, I think any one quarter doesn\u2019t necessarily make a trend, but we were pleased with the results with respect to the U.S. performance. Our overall outlook for the company has always been on the consolidated growth profile. We don\u2019t necessarily nitpick it by country or by region, but we were certainly pleased with the second quarter. John\u2019s referenced that the percentages themselves within a quarter can vary, so we\u2019re certainly cautiously optimistic about the second half.","John Wren","In terms of international growth, Brazil we do point out because we\u2019ve had to take actions and it is still a work in progress for us to get it to the level that we would like it to be. As you go across the rest of the world, the uncertainties that exist because of geopolitical decisions will have some impact on what goes on with our clients and spending. We cannot predict what\u2019s going to happen with Brexit. The good news is we don\u2019t have a lot of financial service clients in the U.K. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with tariffs and what the reaction to that is going to be, so we remain cautious, optimistic but cautious, and trying to gain market share in all the places we operate in.","Alexia Quadrani","Just one follow-up on your U.S. commentary, some of the new business was--some of the headline clients, which I know is not necessarily everything that you see, it seemed a little slower to ramp post their announcements that they shifted their accounts to Omnicom late last year. Do you see still from what you see today, maybe a greater tailwind of new business benefit in the back half of the year than you did in the first half?","John Wren","You\u2019re correct in your comment that some of those headline accounts are slower to ramp up and will start to contribute more in the second half, but I don\u2019t think meaningfully enough to affect our overall guidance of growth of 2 to 3%. ","Alexia Quadrani","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen","John, I wonder if you could elaborate a bit more please on your commentary on renting data and technology rather than buying. It is quite a difference from at least two of your peers, and yet your growth rate has been better than at least one of those. I just wonder if you could give us a bit more on the logic behind this and what difference it actually makes to work with third party data versus having access to first party data, and in terms of renting technology versus owning. Thanks.","John Wren","Okay. Well, as an overall statement, since it seems to be of interest to not only you but probably others, we did look at both of those acquisitions that our competitors made, and if we thought they were worth it, we would have purchased them ourselves. But going back to your question, there\u2019s risk when you do a transaction like that. There\u2019s huge integration risk. You\u2019ve seen it in some instances in other companies in our industry where they\u2019ve done--previously done very large acquisitions for their size and not really been able to successfully integrate them within a relatively short period of time.","The other thing, the other real risk is they are legacy businesses. In Europe, most of them don\u2019t operate but they have GDPR. I can\u2019t tell what the risk is going to be to that data, delivering safe data for brands and what the regulations are going to be in the United States, let alone China or anywhere else, so to us as we looked at it, the risk versus the data versus our ability to obtain the same data but in a very relevant, up-to-date way, there was no ROI on the transactions for us. ","Our systems have always been open and unbiased, and we think that\u2019s critical. It\u2019s critical for us to get the best results for our clients, and we\u2019re focused on creating meaningful outcomes for our clients. I have never wanted to be in a position where the way I sell you something or the way I work on your behalf, you have to buy what legacy systems that I put in place and I don\u2019t have any flexibility of changing those systems to improve them with whatever the marketplace seems to offer, or needs to offer. ","Phil Angelastro","I\u2019d just add, we\u2019ve been building and investing in the Analect and Omni platform for the last 10 years. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve done internally, spent an awful lot of time and energy in having one common platform that\u2019s going to continue to evolve, and as John had said, in an open fashion. It\u2019s also a global platform, not just a U.S. platform, and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in it going forward and maintain the flexibility we have to work with various best-in-class partners and get the data that we need, when we need it from a variety of sources. It\u2019s a much more flexible approach and one that we can scale.","Tim Nollen","Can I just tack onto that last bit that you just mentioned, Phil, about--and it\u2019s again back to the first versus third party data. Do you have access to the first party data you need? We hear more and more about how important that is. Do you have that, or do you disagree that it\u2019s so important, that third party data serves your purposes?","Phil Angelastro","Keep in mind the first party data is the client\u2019s data. It\u2019s not our data. I think to the extent we need it to help whichever client we\u2019re working with, we can easily and effectively help clients integrate our third party data with their first party data in a very effective way. We do that for many clients today and we expect to continue to do that in the future. We don\u2019t see a situation where in the short term or even in the long term, that clients are essentially going to give up the ownership of that first party data, but they need a partner to help them to more meaningfully merge that data with relevant third party data to come up with solutions to help them reach the consumers they\u2019re trying to reach.","John Wren","Said another way, we don\u2019t need to own it to connect to that data on behalf of our clients, and we do that. The data that--those company needs that I think you\u2019re alluding to pales in comparison to the quality that clients have on their own.","Tim Nollen","Right, thanks very much for your explanations.","John Wren","Hype gets people excited because there\u2019s a headline, but when you look to the substance of it, we think--you know, God bless them, but it will be a challenge.","Tim Nollen","Okay, thanks a lot. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","I\u2019m not an economist per se, but I wanted to get a sense from you, when you look at the outlook in the U.S. and also globally, how you\u2019re thinking about the macro backdrop, because we\u2019re seeing a really strong ad market here in the U.S., you guys had nice U.S. and advertising results this quarter, you mentioned you were optimistic for the back half, but there are a lot of leading indicators on the macros that look like they\u2019ve rolled over and people seem to be getting more cautious about factory orders or capital goods or business investment, obviously the Fed talking about slower growth. I\u2019m just curious, I\u2019d love to get your perspective on all that and how you reconcile the strong ad market with what seems to be a slowing broader macro. If you have thoughts on that, I\u2019d love to hear them.","John Wren","I\u2019m no economist either, so you take that for what it\u2019s worth. In speaking to many of our clients, each industry has particular concerns; but if I had to sum it up, everybody--most people believe that the U.S. economy continues to perform well. At the same time, they recognize that the U.S. economy has never performed this well for this long at any point in the past, and so at some point you can expect some dips or some changes. Nobody can figure out the when. I do think you see it having more of an impact on long-term planning in terms of some of our clients that have to commit capital to their businesses in the future. It doesn\u2019t have the same type of impact on the advertising business because we--nothing is completely flexible, but we\u2019re very vigilant about what our clients are doing and what they tell us they\u2019re going to do and the services that we offer, so we\u2019re--we can be a bit more nimble than many, many businesses which require a lot more capital to do things.","Ben Swinburne","Right, that makes sense. Maybe just a separate follow-up. On the competitive front with the IT consulting firms that get a lot of press in the marketplace, one of the things I saw recently is, I\u2019m sure as you know, a lot of these consultants audit agency buying for their clients while at the same time they are competing for business, and I think there have been some agencies or holding companies that have balked at allowing that and turning over media data to get audited by what is essentially a competitor. I was just curious if you thought this was a big issue, yes or no, and if it is, what are the options for you to navigate what seems to be a rising source of conflict on the competitive front?","John Wren","Yes, there\u2019s no absolute answer to your question, but this is not a new problem. Oftentimes, most times with clients, we mutually agree on who is going to audit and not audit our results. I don\u2019t know of any of the major holding companies that have really easily agreed with having them come in and ask the type of questions you\u2019re referring to. I applaud Mark Reid in making it a more public issue, but privately this issue has been dealt with on a client-by-client basis for a long time.","Ben Swinburne","Got it, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Julien Roch with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julien Roch","Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. My first one is on CRM execution and support - that has been a problem for a while, so when can you turn this around, or is it structurally challenged for many years to come, and if the latter, for further disposition? Secondly, you mentioned several times in your opening remarks that some of your event businesses impacted revenue in certain geographies. In which division do you put events and what [indiscernible] this activity presents broadly? Lastly, can we have a sense of the total investment in Analect and Omni in the last 10 years so we can compare that to how much some of your competitors have spent externally? Thank you. ","John Wren","You go ahead, Phil.","Phil Angelastro","As far as CRM execution and support goes, I think the businesses that remain in the portfolio, we continue to work with management and--actually, management of the practice area to get them focused on improving their execution. I think we\u2019ve done a lot in terms of what we intended to do as far as our disposition strategy as it relates to the businesses in that portfolio, but longer term we don\u2019t expect them to grow as rapidly as the rest of our portfolio and we expect we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the pieces of that portfolio as we go forward.","We do have some good businesses that have been performing well in that portfolio. They tend to be the smaller pieces of the portfolio, so we\u2019re going to continue business as usual in trying to help them execute better and turn themselves around, but we\u2019ll also continue to re-evaluate the portfolio as we go down the road. ","With respect to the events businesses, I\u2019m not--if you could repeat your question? I\u2019m not sure I got the last part of it.","Julien Roch","First of all, in which division is it? I assume it\u2019s in CRM, but which bit of CRM?","Phil Angelastro","Yes, it\u2019s in the consumer experience portion--","Julien Roch","It\u2019s in consumer experience? Okay. And then broadly, what percentage of the total Omnicom business is it? Are we talking about 1% of revenue, 5% of revenue? ","Phil Angelastro","It\u2019s probably less than 5% of our revenue on a global basis.","Julien Roch","Okay. Then the last question on Analect and Omni investment?","Phil Angelastro","Yes, I think one broad comment and then I\u2019ll turn it to John, but certainly we\u2019ve invested quite a bit over the last 10 years in Analect and Omni, but probably not close to what the two recent acquisitions--the spend on the two recent acquisitions have been by two of our main competitors.","John Wren","The only thing I\u2019d add is we have made significant investments in the whole area of technology - Analect, tools, some other investments as well. The way that we\u2019ve made these investments is internally, so we expense them as incurred, we don\u2019t capitalize them so you won\u2019t see it on our balance sheet, or in our goodwill for that matter. I\u2019m no accountant, but I do--and it gets quite a bit of priority from the management of Omnicom and the management of other creative businesses because of the importance of the tools that we\u2019re creating and what we\u2019re doing. If you go back, which I don\u2019t suggest you have to do, and listen to prior conference calls or read any one of our prior transcripts, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve been talking about this for 10 years or so.","Phil Angelastro","Yes, the bulk of the investment has been in essentially people, as well as some software tools and technology tools, but it is something that certainly is run through the P&L. It hasn\u2019t been trying to piece together and integrate a bunch of acquisitions, but we also recognize that it\u2019s an investment we need to continue to make and expect to continue to make to continue to maintain and upgrade the platform as technology changes and as the media landscape changes.","Julien Roch","But if you had to venture an amount for investment, are we talking a couple hundred million, $500 million, close to a billion over 10 years, or is too hard to do? Just to have a really broad sense.","John Wren","It\u2019s not too hard, we just don\u2019t--we spend what we need, we don\u2019t add it up and pat ourselves on the back for having spent it. ","Phil Angelastro","Yes, I mean, you could also include or exclude a number of other miscellaneous costs, so you do include the training in that investment, the training in the people which is now global, or don\u2019t you? How do you calculate those numbers? It\u2019s an integrated, integral part of the business that we don\u2019t spend a considerable amount of time trying to figure out every last dollar so that we could report it and have it--make a big splash on how much we\u2019ve invested. It\u2019s an integral, integrated part of the business and investing in this platform is something we\u2019re going to continue to do, and it\u2019s just a basic part of the business.","Julien Roch","Okay, very clear. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael Nathanson","Thank you, I have one for John and then one for John or Phil. John, a question for you is you started the call by saying there\u2019s been a return to the celebration of creativity as a force, and I wonder in that return as that acknowledgement of creativity, are you seeing any change in maybe the pressures on fees or maybe a re-ranking of priorities for your clients? Is there anything that is a business outcome from what you acknowledge as maybe a different focus now on clients?","John Wren","Before I answer your question, this should be the last question we take because I think the markets are just about to open. It\u2019s a recognition, I think. It\u2019s a recognition for the first time in a long time that people realize--clients realize that the differentiation is quality of the creative people that you have. Somebody previously asked about consultants, if we go back to con two years ago, the place was crawling with some of the people that were referred to in the earlier question. There were very few of them there this year, if there were any at all, because they can put in enterprise systems and do fancy things and pretend like they\u2019re in our business, but in fact they don\u2019t have any creative assets, and creating a global network of creative assets is not a simple matter. ","I think if you--I\u2019m not the only one saying it, I think in some of the--I think Maurice L\u00e9vy was interviewed at Sun Valley and he pointed out that when you get through all the changes that are going on in the business, the key thing which remains constant and most important is creativity, so that\u2019s always been our DNA. I think not only do we recognize it and we\u2019ve really cherished it and nurtured it since our beginning, I believe the rest of our competition recognizes that it\u2019s the only differentiation and value that we can really bring to the party.","You said you had two questions?","Michael Nathanson","Yes, the other one was just on acquisition patterns. Is the lack of spending this year acknowledgment of either a change of prioritization or just timing of deals, or maybe just the pricing of deal? Usually you guys do enter the marketplace and buy some assets, but this year you\u2019ve done very little, so I just want to know what\u2019s driving that. ","John Wren","Phil can answer, but I would say mostly circumstance. We\u2019ve recognized the same thing in the second quarter and we\u2019ve since then put more resources in the area of looking for certain selective acquisitions. It\u2019s going to take some time to identify them and then to bring them into the fold. ","Phil Angelastro","Yes, I think we certainly want to do more acquisitions than less in terms of how we use our free cash flow, if we can find the right ones. This particular quarter, there were two acquisitions in particular that we\u2019d been working on for quite some time. One of them, we just couldn\u2019t complete, we couldn\u2019t come to terms. They weren\u2019t economic terms that were the issue with other things. The other just didn\u2019t happen this quarter from a timing perspective. I think we do have a pipeline in place that we\u2019ve been working, but as John had said, we are taking some actions to kind of redouble our efforts to find deals.","I think from a pricing perspective, that really hasn\u2019t been what has held us up or caused us to do less this year than last year. Last year, we had some excellent candidates and got some deals done that have been very successful. We expect that we\u2019ll do more of those in the future","Michael Nathanson","Okay, thank you both.","Phil Angelastro","Thank you. Thank you everybody for taking the time to join the call.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Adrien de Saint Hilaire. Please go ahead.","Phil Angelastro","I think we have to unfortunately end the call, Operator, given the market is now open.","Operator","Okay.","John Wren","Thanks everybody, have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measure in the presentation materials.","We're going to begin the call with some remarks from John Wren about both the state of our business and our potential merger with Publicis. Following John's remarks, we will review our financial performance for the first quarter and then both of us will be happy to take your questions.","John Wren","Good morning. I would like to thank you all for joining our conference call. I am pleased to speak to you about our first quarter business results and update you on the progress we've made on our strategic initiatives. At the end of my remarks for the quarter, I'll update you on the proposed merger with Publicis. Randy and I will be available to answer questions at the end of the prepared remarks.","Omnicom's performance continues to consistently demonstrate the strength, diversity and stability of our business. As you know, 2013 ended successfully as markets improved around the world and we met all our stated objectives for the year. I am pleased to report that our excellent performance in 2013 was reflected in the level of bonuses earned by our employees for achieving these objectives.","2014 is off to a very good start. Irrespective of the timing open issues or complexities of the proposed merger, our employees have remained focused on our clients and growth strategies. Importantly, we are on plan to meet our targets for the full year 2014.","Now, back to the quarter. Our growth strategies continue to result intangible benefits. During the quarter, we made several strategic acquisitions, we continued to enter into innovative partnerships and made significant progress in advancing our industry-leading digital and data platforms. I'll cover this in more detail in a moment.","For the quarter, organic growth was 4.3%. Our year-over-year margins, excluding merger-related expenses, continued to improve. We also continued to invest internally in our talents and agencies to expand our partnerships and to make acquisitions in innovative service areas that will fuel our growth. In many ways, our first quarter results are reaffirmation of our performance in the market improvement we have experience since the second half of 2013.","Broadly speaking, the U.S. and the U.K. are showing consistent forward momentum. Euro markets are steadily, but slowly improving. For the first time since the first quarter of 2012, we had positive organic growth in this region. Among our larger euro markets, Germany was positive for the quarter while France continued to be negative.","Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe continued to perform well with some countries spending above others; specifically, Brazil, Russia China and India. The crisis in Ukraine occurred late in the quarter and we do not yet have visibility on the impact it may have in Russia and our other European operations.","By discipline, we experienced positive results across our business. Within the brand advertising category, we had very strong overall growth in media, including high double-digit increases in search and programmatic buying. In CRM, our sports and event marketing and shopper marketing operations, performed extremely well. In our specialty category, we continue to see very positive growth in our healthcare business.","Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, the diversity and stability of our business has once again reflected in both, our strong cash flow generation and in our industry-leading return on equity. Omnicom's strong cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity provide us the flexibility to prudently and opportunistically invest in our people and our operations as well as in acquisitions that improve and expand our service offerings and footprint.","Overall, I am extremely pleased with the operating and financial performance of our business. Let me now provide an update on the progress we are making against our key strategic initiatives. Recruiting, developing and retaining the best talent, expanding our geographic footprint and service offerings to our clients, particularly in emerging disciplines in economy, investing in our digital and analytical competencies in the key markets around the world and delivering big ideas based upon meaningful consumer insights across all marketing and communication channels.","Our ongoing investments in recruitment, diversity and training programs are helping us improve the skills of the many talented individuals at our agencies. An important measurement of our challenges is industry peer and client recognition. Let me just mention a few of our achievements during the quarter. FleishmanHillard was named agency of the year by PRWeek. BBDO Worldwide was named the most awarded agency network in the world in 2013 Gunn Report for the eighth consecutive year and DVB was the third most awarded network. Also for the eighth consecutive year, Omnicom's Media Group, OMD Worldwide was named the world's most creative media agency by the Gunn Report.","I want to congratulate all the people and agencies for their many outstanding achievements. As I mentioned on our last call, collaboration across different marketing services and geographies is the new normal. Many large multinational clients are asking us to manage their entire marketing process bringing them big ideas and delivering them across disciplines, media and markets.","At Omnicom, we have formed teams of subject matter experts from across our agencies for the purpose of delivering integrated solutions, building brand and driving results for our clients. Our approach is designed to fulfill our clients' needs and desires for integrated services and allows us to support and grow the iconic brands in our portfolio. We believe our ability to recruit and retain top talent and to provide the best service to our clients is achieved by ensuring our brands maintain their individuality and collaborate to meet our clients' needs.","To further strengthen our efforts, we have recently announced that Peter Sherman is rejoining Omnicom as an Executive Vice President to lead innovation and collaboration across our client portfolio. Peter is returning to Omnicom from J. Walter Thompson, where he served as CEO of North America. In the war for talent, there's nothing more rewarding than seeing a former employee rejoin Omnicom after leaving for a period of time to work for a competitor.","Last quarter, we continued to expand our capabilities through acquisitions in the digital and in mobile areas. In February, we completed the acquisition of 22feet one of India's leading and most dynamic digital marketing firms. 22feet will be merged with Tribal Worldwide, India part of the DDB Mudra Group. The new agency will offer its clients end-to-end digital and mobile marketing solutions.","In Brazil, we took a majority stake in the advertising agency Mood. Continuing to expand the capabilities of the TBWA Brazil group, Mood's culture of innovation and depth of talent will strengthen our business capabilities in that market. Also in Latin America, Omnicom's Media Group recently acquired Media Interactive, which expands our capabilities in Chile, Colombia and Peru.","Lastly, in the U.K., Omnicom's Media Group acquired Mobile5, whose work includes creating mobile ads, developing apps and building mobile sites. Mobile5 will serve as a mobile Center of Excellence for the group in the European region. In addition to these acquisitions, we continue making internal investment in our networks, agencies and service platforms.","Today's market complexity demands our agencies to deliver their services seamlessly and efficiently across mediums and markets. Given this backdrop, Omnicom recently announced the formation of Eg+ Worldwide, a global implementation and production agency which will be a leader in leveraging the latest technologies to help global brands implement, amplified and localized creative concepts across moving, image, digital and print media channels.","Today, Eg+ deliver services globally through our offices in L.A., New York, Paris London, Singapore and Tokyo, supported by digital production centers in China, India Mexico and Poland. Eg+ has 39 offices and more than 1,200 employees around the world.","As I have said before, our industry has become increasingly complex and fragmented. New platforms and technologies come and go at mach speed. We have therefore maintained an open partnership with technological leaders as opposed to making bets on specific platforms. This approach allows us to have access to the latest technologies for the benefit of our clients marketing strategy.","Consistent with this strategy, last month we signed the first of its kind agreement with Instagram. Instagram product change will partner with our media and creative agencies, including our OMD PHD as well as BBDO, DDB and TBWA, to develop highly visual digital concepts for our clients. Overall, our diverse service capabilities and top talent, combined with our open-source approach to technology and extensive partnerships, are unique in our industry and position us extremely well for the future.","Turning to the proposed merger with Publicis, given the merger's complexity and open issues, the transaction is moving slower than we originally anticipated. To better understand our progress, it is important to delineate the three separate approval tracks we are working on. First is antitrust. Clearance has been obtained in the U.S., the E.U. and 12 other countries around the world. China is the only market remaining for antitrust approval.","On April 17th, Omnicom and Publicis entered Phase 3 of the Chinese review process. Phase 3 is a 60-day period ending June 16, 2014. If the regulator is not able to resolve all questions by June 16th, we will need to withdraw and resubmit our filings and continue the process. Second is tax, the French tax ruling approval process is pending. In addition, Omnicom and Publicis have made joint applications with other tax authorities for purposes of establishing the desired tax treatment of the new Publicis Omnicom Group. Specifically, we have jointly applied to the Dutch Ministry of Finance and the U.K. HM Revenue & Customs authority to establish exclusive tax residency in the United Kingdom. Unexpectedly to-date, we have been unable to obtain the Competent Authority agreements necessary to establish the tax status. If we cannot obtain these agreements, it could affect the likelihood of satisfaction of the conditions to closing of our deal.","Last, other regulatory approvals, the S4 has to be filed with reviewed and declared effective by the SEC, similarly the European perspectives is to be filed with reviewed and approved by the AFM, the Netherlands regulatory authority for financial markets. We have not yet completed our filed documents with either the SEC or the AFM. The timing, financial statement preparation and other disclosures are in process. Given the proposed merger's complexity and open issues, at this point it's not practical to predict exactly when the transaction will close.","Before I turn the call back to Randy, we will go through Omnicom's first quarter financial performance in greater detail, I'd like to make a few final comments.","Financially, Omnicom has continued to excel in delivering consistent revenue growth, strong margin performance, stable cash flows and an industry leading return on invested capital. We remain strongly committed to maintaining this performance. Strategically, we have a very stable talent base and are making significant progress on our core priorities. We believe, we are very well positioned to compete in an increasingly complex and dynamic landscape.","Our liquidity and strong balance sheet allow us to further invest in the business, make acquisitions and deliver value to our shareholders. Finally, I'd like to acknowledge the spirit and drive of the people at all of our companies that I believe are the best in the industry. The creativity and insights they deliver to our world-class clients, their ability to work together across disciplines and geographies and their financial discipline are the key factors that show themselves in our top and bottom line results. Randy?","Randall Weisenburger","Thank you. As John detailed, our agencies continue to make excellent progress against both, their strategic and operational objectives. They have continued to make the investments needed to further develop and expand their capabilities, which consistently resulted in the highest organic growth rates in the industry. I think the market now stands at 19 in the last 22 years. Equally important, they have made these investments while establishing a track record of delivering outstanding quarter-to-quarter financial performance for our shareholders.","As John also pointed out, our Q1 performance is a great start to keeping that track record going for another year. As we have done for last couple of quarters, this quarter we have again added our third column of numbers labeled non-GAAP. The only difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP figures is that we have excluded the incremental cost and we have incurred related to the potential merger with Publicis in the non-GAAP figures. These costs which are predominantly professional fees totaled $7 million during the quarter. Most of these costs are not tax-deductible, therefore most of the cost flow straight through to net income. This quarter net income was reduced by $6.8 million and EPS was impacted by $0.03. We believe that the non-GAAP figures help in evaluating the performance of our operations.","For the presentation, I will focus most of my comments on the non-GAAP column, so we have included the reported numbers side-by-side for easy reference and clarity.","Page 1, for the quarter, revenue came in at $3.5 billion. The good news was organic revenue growth, which following another industry-leading year in 2013, increased again this quarter to 4.3%. The bad news was FX continued to be a fairly strong headwinds, negatively impacting revenue by 70 basis points and acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by another 60 basis points. I'll go into further detail on our revenue growth in a few minutes.","Moving down to P&L, our non-GAAP EBITDA increased 4.3% to $414 million and resulting EBITDA margin was 11.8%, which was up 10 basis points over Q1 of last year. FX this quarter, in addition to hurting revenue, also negatively impacted operating margins by about 10 basis points. The markets where FX had a biggest negative impact were Brazil, Canada and Russia, which are generally higher than average margin markets as well.","In spite of the FX challenges, non-GAAP operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased 4.8% to $390 million and the operating margin of 11.1% increased 20 basis points year-over-year. Again, the only difference between the non-GAAP and GAAP numbers is the exclusion of the $7 million of incremental merger-related costs.","Turning to Page 2, and looking at the items below operating income. First, net interest expense for the quarter was $39 million, down $1.9 million year-over-year and down about $800,000 from the fourth quarter. Almost all of the change was due to lower short-term debt balances driven by both, better working capital management and the suspension of our share repurchase program since the middle of last year.","Taxes, due to the increased benefits from the tax reorganization that we completed at the end of 2012, our operating tax rate for the quarter [and] in line with our expectations going forward will be about 33.2%, down from the 33.6% rate we had for the last couple of years. The GAAP tax rate of 33.8% was higher this quarter, because nearly all of the merger costs are not tax-deductible.","Earnings from our affiliates decreased to $600,000 this quarter, primarily as a result of a reduction in the year-over-year performance of certain of our affiliates in the Middle East, and the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders and our less than fully owned subsidiaries increased $2.8 million to $22.5 million, mainly the result of the strong performance of our Latin American and Middle Eastern operations which have a local minority shareholders. As a result of the foregoing, our non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $212 million, an increase of 3.5% versus Q1 of 2013.","On Slide 3, we show the allocation of net income to common shareholders and to participating securities, which are the unvested restricted shares held by our employees. The resulting non-GAAP net income available for common shares in Q1 was $208 million. This chart also shows our diluted share count, which with the suspension of our share buyback program is only down marginally from Q1 of 2013. As a result, our non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 5.3% to $0.80 and our GAAP EPS increased $0.01 to $0.77 per share.","On Slide 4, we take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX, on a year-over-year basis the U.S. dollar weakened versus the euro, the pound in the RMB. It strengthened against most of our other significant operating currencies. The more significant markets included Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan and Russia. The net result reduced our revenue for the quarter by $22 million or about 0.7%.","Looking ahead, if FX rates stay where they are currently, we expect FX to turn positive by about 60 basis points in Q2 and about 25 basis points for the full-year. Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by 0.6%. This is primarily due to the sale of a recruitment marketing business during the second quarter of 2013. Our recent acquisitions continue to partially offset the impact of this disposition.","We expect acquisitions net of dispositions to be negative again in the second quarter, but then we cycle through the disposition of the recruitment marketing business by the third quarter and acquisitions should have a positive effect in the second half of the year. Finally, with regard organic growth, we had another strong quarter, up 4.3% or about $147 million. This was driven by a combination of items. First, our agencies continue to benefit from the development and expansion of their integrated digital capabilities. Although widespread, the growth of our media business is the most recent best example of this trend.","We also continue to benefit from the strong performance of our agencies in the emerging markets. This quarter, we had excellent organic performance in a number of markets, including Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, India, Indonesia and Malaysia. Finally, although slow, the recovery of Europe and our European businesses continues.","Turning to our mix of business on Slide 5, for the quarter, our revenue was split 49% brand advertising and 51% marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 4.9%, again driven by the strong growth in our media business and marketing services was up 3.8%.","Within marketing services, CRM was up 4.2%, a strong performance across our businesses with our events, sales promotion, production and research businesses leading the way. Public relations was up 1.2% in the quarter and specialty communications increased 5.2%, driven by another strong quarter from our healthcare businesses.","On Slide 6, our regional mix of business in the quarter was split approximately 57% in North America, 25% in Europe, 10% in Asia Pacific, with the remainder in Latin America and Africa, and the Middle East.","In North America, we had organic revenue growth of 4.8%, driven by our media, brand advertising and CRM businesses. Our other regions, all had positive organic growth as well. Europe was up 2.3%, led by strong performance in the U.K. and Russia. Asia-Pac was up 5.7%, Latin America was up 7.4% led by strong results in Brazil and Africa and the Middle East was up 6.6%.","In our larger European markets as I mentioned earlier, the U.K. and Russia continued their strong performance. Germany, Ireland, Portugal and Spain were all positive this quarter and unfortunately France continue to struggle. Although our organic revenue performance in aggregate for the Eurozone was only marginally positive in the quarter, this represented the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement.","In Asia-Pac, we had strong performances across most of the region with double-digit organic growth in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines and high single-digit growth in India, New Zealand, China, Vietnam and Singapore.","In Latin America, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, all turned in double-digit organic results. We have also provided an additional slide on Page 7 that presents our revenue by our old geographic subsets. Obviously, this is the same revenue data just group differently. I'll leave that information for you to review separately.","On Slide 8, we present our mix of business by industry sector. Keep in mind, these numbers are total growth, not just organic growth. As you can see, there was only a slight change year-over-year, with the retail sector increasing on the strength of several client wins over the past year and the telecom sector lagging behind this quarter.","Now, turning to Slide 9, first you will notice we changed the format of this slide, so you have to let us know offline what you think about the new presentation. As for our performance, we had a strong start to the year from a cash perspective as well. We generated $312 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital during the quarter.","As for our primary uses of cash, dividends paid during the quarter totaled $131 million, consisting of dividends to common shareholders of $106 million and then $25 million paid to minority interest shareholders. This was up significantly from last year, when we pay our normal Q1 dividend in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Capital expenditures of $42 million was up about $4 million from last year, acquisitions including earnout payments, net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments totaled $16 million. Finally share repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled only $9 million. This is down $230 million from 2013, because we were required to suspend our share repurchase program following the announcement of the potential merger with Publicis. As a result, we generated $114 million in net free cash during the quarter, again, excluding changes in working capital.","Turning to Slide 10, focusing first on our capital structure, the primary year-over-year change was the redemption of $407 million of our convertible notes during the second quarter of last year. As a result, our total debt at March 31st was down to just over $4 billion and our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $1, 950 billion, down about $420 million from last year. As a result of the decreased debt, our total debt to EBITDA ratio improved to 1.9 times and our net debt to EBITDA ratio improved to just 0.9 times and our interest coverage ratio remains very strong at 10.8 times.","On Slide 11, you can see we again delivered excellent returns on both, total invested capital and common equity. Although both return figures were negatively impacted by the suspension of our share repurchase program, they remained very strong with the return on invested capital of 17.1% and return on equity of 29% for your reference, these returns were computed under reporting GAAP numbers, not the non-GAAP figures.","Finally, on slide 12, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders for the last 10 years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from fiscal 2004 through March 31st of this year, which totaled $9.1 billion, and the bars below show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders including both, dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during that period totaled $9.4 billion for cumulative payout ratio of just over 103%. During this period, as a result of both, our internal investments and very targeted acquisitions, we also grew revenue and EPS by 69% and 220%, respectively.","With that, that concludes our prepared remarks. There are a number of other supplemental slides included in the presentation materials for your review, but at this point we are going to ask the operator to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from the line of Craig Huber, representing Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.","John Wren","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Randy or John - Hi. Can you just elaborate a little bit further your comments earlier just about what's potentially holding up the merger with Publicis. You mentioned some tax issues and stuff go a little deeper in depth if you would please. Thanks.","John Wren","Sure. I think as we have said consistently, this is a very complex transaction. As a result, there are issues that arise which have to be solved, so there are really great deal challenges. There is a number of gating items as I attempted to explain. From a statutory point of view, we have cleared everywhere, but China, where we are in phase, what they call Phase 3.","By comparison, Randy might have a little bit more color on this. (Inaudible) I believe was in Phase 3 for 43 days, 45 days something along those lines and the Chinese will move at the speed chart - Chinese will move, we respond to their questions as they come up and we have to satisfactorily answer all of the regulators questions before we will get approval.","With respect to tax, let me turn that one to Mike O'Brien, because it is complex. I do have an understanding of it, but not quite as good as others.","Mike O'Brien","Yes. Craig, I think as John mentioned and I think as everyone knows, the tax structure of our deal is very complex and somewhat unexpectedly or probably very unexpectedly, obtaining regulatory approvals from the various tax authorities has become more difficult than I think we originally anticipated at the time we signed the deal.","You have to keep in mind too that our agreements with Publicis have a lot of requirements, there's a lot of conditions and covenants, so there is a lot of moving parts, if you will. You got to remember the new company is to be incorporated in the Netherlands. The agreements required Publicis', Omnicom's principal place of business being the United Kingdom. The agreement calls for the merger to be tax-free in a lot of prospects free to Omnicom, tax free to our shareholders, tax free to Publicis, tax-free to Publicis' shareholders. Finally, our agreements with Publicis require that the new company be a tax resident of the United Kingdom and that's essential for the new company's tax planning going forward. So complying with all these different covenants and conditions, certainly presents certain complexities and challenges. We still have a lot of work ahead of us.","John Wren","It's not a complete answer to your question, because we don't know. We are tackling these things as we can and as quickly as we can and then we have yet to submit as I said on call the regulatory filings to both, to the SEC and the AFM.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Then unrelated question, Randy, if I could just ask the perform you guys had in the quarter on the organic revenue front and in EBITDA margins of I guess, 14 basis points year-over-year adjusted for the one-time items. Would you expect that similar type performance for the remainder of the year for quorum account please?","John Wren","Yes. Not 100% sure of that. We are certainly working to drive every efficiency we can from the business, but now we are going to have 14 basis points of margin expansion every quarter, I am not sure. First quarter is a smaller quarter. We have had great results. Our businesses are working, I think, extremely hard both, on the business front and the cost control front, but we are focused predominantly on investing in our core activities, expanding our capabilities to drive revenue growth on a long-term basis.","We have gotten hurt this quarter in particularly by other 10-plus basis points because of FX. I noted that, I don't know how prominently it came out of my comments. Most of the time FX is pretty neutral when it comes to margins, but this quarter frankly the markets where FX was negative happen to be markets that have higher than normal or higher than our average margins, so it did have a bit more of a negative impact on margins than what used to be.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Lastly, real quick if I could, your net new client wins bigger in the second quarter, but what was that size please? You usually target about a $1 billion you would hope for?","Randall Weisenburger","Yes. We are a little bit under a $1 billion this quarter, largely because of the Vodafone loss. You will get those pretty solid new business period, but as I've always said each quarter you get one or two big wins or one or two big losses and it pushes you sort of above or below that $1 billion marks, so unfortunately this quarter we are a little bit below it.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Great. Thank you.","John Wren","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","","Thank you. Just a follow-up question on your comment regarding your merger, I guess given the challenges with the tax approvals and the fact that you are guys had to wait at stuff for the Chinese approvals. Would you likely hold off and sign I guess a proxy until you get more clarity on these issues?","John Wren","Well, that is very complex. As soon as we file our Q, we begun to update our financial statements, we order - we will have to do a little bit of work for the first quarter. Reconciling our GAAP financials to IFRS, so we will continue to work on it.","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","","Okay, then just a follow-up on the cash. I think, we have talked about in the past for, if it wasn't clear, you have to wait till the merger is complete, so within the buyback or just maybe have the filing done, but I guess it sounds like the filing will still be a little raised off here. Should we assume that right now your cash balance will just obviously build or will you go up through maybe acquisitions or other uses of cash or? I guess any commentary you give on that would be great.","Randall Weisenburger","Cash flow obviously builds unless we have uses for it. Our acquisition pipeline is pretty full, but as everyone knows, we are pretty discriminating when it comes to acquisitions. We will continue to be very prudent with shareholders' money and make the acquisitions that we think are beneficial for shareholders. The timing of that, you know, frankly is when the acquisitions are ready to close. I don't think it's really possible for us to spend as much money as we are generating with acquisitions, so inevitably I guess that means the cash balances will build.","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","","I guess, I put it in another way and I am not sure if this is that easy to answer, but has your priorities for use of cash longer term changed or right now it's sort of you are in a bit of a holding pattern. You still will evaluate acquisitions given the full pipeline, but you have always in the past had a preference for share buybacks. Is it too soon given all the plans and mergers to make that depend that statement still a preference or can we - that once everything is set out and you are free to get back in the market that would likely be use of cash.","Randall Weisenburger","Just to be clear what I've always stated is we are going to consistently pay dividend and try to increase that dividend pretty regularly. Our next priority is making acquisitions that are beneficial to our shareholders and growing our business. Then we basically use the balance of cash in share repurchases, but our first priority has always been great acquisitions.","We generate a lot of free cash. It's frankly difficult to spend that amount of free cash on acquisitions that are accretive for our shareholders, so our historical or recent preference has been to internal development which is a strong focus of every one of our businesses to make sure we have the capabilities necessary to serve our clients.","John Wren","There is nothing to add to that. Those have consistently been our objectives and the way that we have approached it. Omnicom will continue to do that as long as Omnicom is here. A couple of quarters delay on the share repurchase program. It doesn't alter our long-range [projected] views or strategic plans.","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","","Okay. Thank you very much.","John Wren","Thank you.","Randall Weisenburger","Frankly, because we have cash doesn't mean we are not focused on making sure we pay every bit of attention possible to our own cash management working capital initiatives. Frankly, we have re-doubled those efforts probably each year for the last couple of years.","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of James Dix with Wedbush. Please go ahead.","James Dix - Wedbush","Thanks very much. Just a couple of things as you think about the combined company kind of after the transaction. I think you've indicated in the past some expectations for higher organic growth of the companies to do that separately maybe in a range of 100 basis points or so. I am just wondering if you could give any more color qualitatively where that growth would come from, any particular types of disciplines, any particular types of regions, just thinking through that, so we can understand where that's coming from.","Then just secondly, in terms of the media buying and planning business specifically, how should we think about the greater now potential for that business to get leverage in the market, in particular on the digital marketing side where it would seem the benefits of scale are quite different than in a more traditional areas like (Inaudible). Thanks very much.","John Wren","Sure. I'll do the first bit last. Certainly, larger media scale is a contributor to growth. Omnicom and separately Publicis are large enough individually by themselves to get as prices as we know it today. What it will do it give us a broader client base from which to go out especially from a individual front - premium type inventory as clients may want and therefore we can service or enter into agreement to get a first look or to do whatever we need to do at that time.","Then area by way that we spend a fortune - we spend an appropriate amount of money internally investing in, because if you had a strategy a month ago it's not necessarily the strategy for the future, because the environment is changing so rapidly and so you have to stay on top of it all the time. Scale will help.","In terms of our comments and I think I am just going back to our road show and moving consistent since then post the merger, and when I say post the merger I don't mean post the merger, but after the company start to integrate we have a better opportunity than we currently have marginally, but for cross-selling, we are going into new areas, we are doing a number of things. Those are efforts which are embedded and for the principal reasons for Omnicom's consistent growth over the last 19 years and so more clients the (Inaudible) systems, so we look. We have the systems, we have the people that are trained to Omni Systems, of the systems, so we so we look forward to that.","James Dix - Wedbush","Great. Thanks very much.","John Wren","Thank you, James.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of William Bird representing FBR. Please go ahead.","William Bird -FBR","Good morning. Other important open issues related to the deal beyond the three-track cited?","John Wren","There are multiple issues. I mean, I don't know - important is a qualitative word the most urgent are they gating items that I mentioned.","Randall Weisenburger","I mean, it's a large complex transaction, so until the day we close, there is going to be items that are scores of internal staff and attorneys are focused on. There is a lot to be done here, but there was gating items of the other primary focus to getting the deal close.","William Bird -FBR","Thanks. When will you know the outcome on your tax status? Is that knowable and how do you think about plan B should approval not come through?","John Wren","Well, I think there are scheduled meetings between the two groups, scheduled for beginning in next week with the appropriate experts to determine the next steps about going back to the regulators and what we will need to do what we won't need to do.","With respect to a number of items that Michael mentioned, there is no plan B. Those things are requirements to get to a closing.","William Bird -FBR","Thank you.","John Wren","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","We will go to line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets","Good morning guys. I'll maybe return to the questions around media planning and buying a little bit more. Thank you for the data around your growth in search and programmatic media and I was just wondering, John, if you could expand on that a little bit. Just maybe broadly, broad comment as that business accelerates it sort of how you see the future of media buying evolving. Is that group around intellect and elsewhere in the business starts to move up and then maybe just specifically around the growth you are seeing, if that's more a combination of more clients being willing to come and execute their plans like that or an extension of services of Omnicom. I am sure it's a little bit of both and they overlap, but I would love to hear a little bit more on that.","John Wren","Sure. Well, your first question analytics is the primary and its related services are where we are concentrating Omnicom's efforts, so as to make what we are doing or the strategy and approach we are taking are very focused and controlled and not scattered to the diversity of our company and has proved to be very successful and we have been able to move very quickly in becoming world-class.","The marketplace as you know is changing. Clients and data to indicate return on investment are becoming accepting digital buys increasingly every week every day. Some are early adopters, some are little slower to dedicated increasing part of their budget and mobile is just about to take off, and I don't know sitting here today how much of existing budgets mobile will draw, but we are working under the assumption that between display and also to digital venues, it's going to increasingly over the coming years drive more and more of the clients' budget, because we will be able to tell our - the messaging as to who we reach, when we reach them and what the message we are using to reach them is, so a lot of effort, a lot of very successful platforms are being developed, a lot of very innovative partnerships are being entered into and it's ongoing.","We mentioned Instagram on the call. I was hoping to have yet another interesting one done before the call and then probably come in the next couple of days, so it's very iterative and it's a very dynamic landscape platform.","Randall Weisenburger","Dan, you probably know that as well as anybody. You have done some really great work in the space with some your digital hub work. I think the last one I read I thought you nailed it pretty well.","Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks and thanks for all that detail John. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Arthur with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Doug Arthur - Evercore","Yes. Randy, just a question on cost trends. Office and general expenses have been sort of flat to down year-over-year for five quarters. Why is it happening? Is that likely to persist as a trend for the full-year?","Doug Arthur - Evercore","Before I answer your questions, let me just point that we are getting pretty close to market open, so we are going to have this to your last call or last question. Frankly, there is a tremendous focus throughout the company, throughout every agency top to bottom and side-to-side focused on increasing the efficiency of our operations. It's a requirement of our clients, it's a requirement in the marketplace to stay competitive. So, frankly we are changing the way offices are being structured, we are changing the way we are managing all of our back office and support costs.","We have to obviously continue to deliver to our clients the level of consulting services, because that's frankly what they are buying, but how we are overseeing, how we are housing, how we are managing those operations are getting more and more efficient every day.","I'll say unfortunately from the standpoint of our ability to drive efficiencies were already pretty efficient in those areas, so while there is continuous improvement, those improvements can only have a certain degree of ultimate effect, because a relatively small percentage of our total cost.","Doug Arthur - Evercore","Great thank.","Randall Weisenburger","Does that cover everything you had?","Doug Arthur - Evercore","Yes. I mean, I guess, I was just looking for some color on you are implying that you have kind of done everything you can, but is no - slightly up likely to be a trend for the rest of the year.","Randall Weisenburger","No. Hopefully, I didn't say that. I didn't mean that we have done everything we can do. I said is, we have done a lot and we are going to continue to focus on and continue to drive those cost improvements. I think those costs are hopefully flat to maybe slightly declining while we were growing revenue.","There are mix issues and there are geographic issues when FX bounces around the way it's done in the last, I'll say few quarters. This quarter in particular, some of the places where FX has had its biggest impact are our higher margin countries and therefore it does have a negative impact a little bit on the margins.","Doug Arthur - Evercore","Okay. Great. I got it. Thanks.","John Wren","We have still three minutes, so.","Randall Weisenburger","I guess, we will take one more question.","Operator"," All right, our final question today will come from line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo","Thanks. A question for John, one of the primary support point you offered for the merger was kind of the rapid evolution the tech landscape. Given then it's been about nine months since the announcement and the tech space and the marketing tech space has been early active, just wondering if you could update your thoughts here and tell us whether things are kind of roughly playing out the way you expected. Thanks very much.","John Wren","Thank you. Well, I think as Maurice has said, I have said many times. We continue to operate as two separate companies until the merger is approved, and we continue to enter into partnerships to make internal investments as fast as we can absorb them and where we see the - you where the stuff is going and that's what we attempt to do every single day and especially in the digital area and our partnerships with all these technology partners and our importance to them allow us some insights as to where they are going and what is going to be beneficial to our clients and that's how we prioritize our investments. That's just rapidly growing every day. I have a meeting later on today we are all approved - some significant internal spending to support some programs and some platforms that we believe will start to become normalized by the end of the year that will contribute to our growth in the future, so we continue to make those investments, we have a fabulous team and there we go.","In terms of what our services are and we know what they're not, because there's a lot of confusion when you listen to people and see how each holding company is described. What we do is, we thought we are actually client-focused and most of our people at this point are digitally, I would say (Inaudible) are digitally competent to a much higher level than was two, three years ago or five years ago and that only improves every single day and Omnicom is very well-positioned. It contributes to our overall growth, because there isn't a campaign or assignment that is significantly digital today, so we continue as I'm sure Publicis does in making investments in this area, because it is the future and that's where the puck is going to go.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo","Thank you, John.","Randall Weisenburger","Okay. Thank you all very much. We appreciate your time. If you follow-up questions, we will be happy to try to take them offline. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. We thank you for your participation and using the AT&T Executive TeleConference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to introduce you to your host for today's conference, Vice President of Investor Relations, Shub Mukherjee. Please go ahead.","Shub Mukherjee","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our third quarter 2017 earnings call. On the call with me today is John Wren, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Phil Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer.","We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release we have posted on our website, www.omnicomgroup.com, this morning's press release along with the presentation covering the information that we will review this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I've been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation, and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and that these statements are our present expectation and that actual events or results may differ materially.","I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. You will find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.","We are going to begin this morning's call with an overview of our business from John Wren. Then, Phil Angelastro will provide our financial results for the quarter, and then we will open up the line for your questions.","John Wren","Thank you, Shub. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I am pleased to speak to you this morning about our third quarter results. Organic growth for the third quarter was 2.8%. For the nine months ended September 30, organic growth was 3.5%.","EBITDA margin in the quarter was 13.2%, an increase of 50 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2016. In the third quarter, reported revenue was down 1.9% compared to the prior year. Net acquisition disposition revenue was negative 5.7% for the quarter. The disposition process that we started in the fourth quarter of 2016 was substantially completed in the first four months of 2017 and will cycle through the financial statements through early 2018.","We did see a benefit to the revenue from FX changes in the quarter of 1%. Phil will discuss the estimated impact of net acquisitions dispositions and currencies in more detail during his remarks. Looking at our revenue by geography, organic growth in North America was 2.1% in the quarter, driven by our media, healthcare and events businesses, offset by declines in our direct marketing and branding agencies.","Drilling down in the region, growth in the United States was 2.4% and was offset by a small reduction in Canada. Although small, Puerto Rico also declined in the quarter, and our main focus now is on helping our people and agencies in the market recover from the effects of the hurricane.","Our branding business, which I mentioned on our last call, which is largely project-based continue to struggle. As I will discuss later, we have recently made management changes in the business and have corrected some of the operational issues we encountered. We expect the branding business to begin to stabilize as a result of these changes. PR in North America was also slightly negative in the quarter.","Turning to markets outside North America, the UK grew at 3.8%. Our media, healthcare and PR agencies drove our growth in the UK, offset by declines in our field marketing business. Organic growth in the rest of Europe was 7.8%.","In Euro Markets, overall growth was strong. Germany and France grew in the mid-single-digits, Spain performed extremely well, and The Netherlands had positive results after a number of negative quarters. Outside the Euro Markets, our agencies performed well, including Russia, which had very positive results.","Looking at Asia Pacific, third quarter organic growth was 1.4%. India, Japan and Singapore, all outperformed in the region, offset by negative performance in China. Latin America was down 5.4%. Our operations in Latin America other than Brazil had positive results.","Brazil is by far the largest market in the region and drove the negative performance. At this stage it is difficult for us to predict when our business in Brazil will consistently improve, but we remain cautiously optimistic.","Looking at our bottom line, EPS increased to a $1.13 per share for the quarter versus $1.06 per share for the same quarter a year ago. In the first nine months of the year, we generated a little under $1.2 billion in free cash flow and returned over $900 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Last week, we announced the quarterly dividend increase of $0.05 per share or 9.1%. Our use of cash remains consistent with past practice, paying our dividend, pursuing accretive acquisitions, and repurchasing shares with the balance of our free cash flow. Our cash flow, balance sheet, and liquidity remained very strong.","Looking at the rest of the year, there are couple of factors that result in less visibility as we plan for the fourth quarter, as has been the case over a number of years this quite a bit of project work that occurs in the fourth quarter that can impact revenue. Each year, we've found this year-end project work is between $200 million and $250 million. Client spending on these projects is not easy to forecast, and typically it is based on individual client circumstances and general economic conditions.","Having said that, our agencies remain laser focused on servicing their clients, driving growth, and managing their costs. We remain committed to delivering our revenue and margin targets for the full-year 2017.","I'd like to turn now to discuss some of the factors affecting our industry and how Omnicom is responding as an organization. As you are well aware many of the world's largest companies and best known brands are experiencing fundamental changes in their industries due to new technologies, disruptive competitors and changing consumer behavior.","For these large brands, the name is many of us grew up with the relationship with their customers has changed. That's because technology has advanced to a point where consumers today want information that is directly relevant to their needs. Given the challenges many of our clients facing there is a significant opportunity for Omnicom to help them transform the way they approach their customers.","Marketing needs to be tied into the advertisers' broader strategy, including sales, service, product innovation, and other functions with the consumer at the center. With this in mind, we continue to transform the way we are organized in a manner that allows our management, people and agencies to effect change by offering clients the most creative minds with access through the latest tools in the marketplace.","To do so Omnicom remains focused on our key strategic priorities, growing and developing our talent, while increasing the diversity of our workforce, simplifying our service offerings through our new practice area and client metric structure, making investments in our agencies and through acquisitions and partnerships to expand our capabilities in digital, data and analytics, and continuing to execute our operational efficiency initiatives.","Given our focus on providing our clients with consumer centric services in the third quarter we formed a new practice area by combining our CRM and digital agencies, we form Omnicom Precision Marketing Group, which will be led by Luke Taylor. Luke recently joined Omnicom and was formerly CEO of DigitasLBi. He is one of best and brightest in our industry, when it comes to CRM strategies and digital business transformation.","We are extremely pleased to have in this part of our organization. There is a tremendous opportunity for Omnicom Precision Marketing to leverage Annalect, our core data in analytics platform, and to working partnership with our creative and media agencies to help our clients put individual identities at the center of their marketing.","It will help us drive growth by getting the right message, to the right person, at the right time, and on the right platform, and in the right context. It is the capability such as these that will enable Omnicom's clients to form the direct relationship with the consumer that is needed in today's digital and always connected world.","Indeed Omnicom is committed to being a first mover when it comes to offering clients to latest media, technology, data and e-commerce tools. We already have more than 100 partnership agreements and recently sign deals with the number of first party data suppliers as we look to build richer, bigger data sets.","In addition to Omnicom Precision Marketing, we now have practice areas in place for healthcare, PR, and national brand advertising. Several others are in-process and should be completed in the first half of 2018. Our practice area in client metric structure enables better sharing of expertise in knowledge, creates more career opportunities for our people, strengthens our new business development efforts, leverages our internal investments and allows us to identify acquisition opportunities for the group.","As an example, Omnicom Health Group has created several forums for our experts in the healthcare working across our clients that meet regularly to brainstorm ideas, bringing added value and innovation to those clients. On the people front, Omnicom Health Group launched a fellowship program to bringing graduating students with advanced scientific and medical degrees that rotate through various disciplines in the group in their first year of employment.","They have also established a centralized human resource function to look at talent in a more holistic way. This allows the group to open more doors for our people as they grow and evolve, and to move them across our agencies as the key roles develop.","On the technology front, Omnicom Health Group agencies are leveraging the data marketing capabilities that they acquired through the BioPharm acquisition with Annalect data sources to open new ways for our pharmaceutical clients to engage physicians. Our other practice areas are working in similar ways to enhance the opportunities for our people and the services we deliver to our clients.","Overall, I'm very pleased with the way our practice areas are developing. On the topic of retaining and developing the best talent, one of the hallmarks of Omnicom is that we strive to make our organization a place where people can build their careers. We place considerable effort on succession planning, advancement and diversity.","A great example of this is the recent appointment of John Osborn as the CEO of OMD's U.S. Operation. Ossie joined BBDO in 1996 and rose to the level of President and CEO of BBDO New York in his 21 years.","Ossie was looking for the next chapter in his career, so Daryl Simm and Robinson and myself, thought he'd be a perfect fit for running OMD USA. As content and context become increasingly intertwined, agency leadership with experience across the broad spectrum of marketing services is critical to growth and client success.","More recently, Charles Trevail, CEO of our agency C Space, became the new CEO of Interbrand. In addition, C Space will become part of Interbrand. Charles joined Omnicom in 2012 when C Space purchased Promise Corporation, a company he founded. Charles has a proven track record of building brands and we're pleased to have him in his new role.","The Interbrand and C Space partnership is also an opportunity to bring world-class expertise together, brand building, and consumer experience to drive growth for our clients.","One of the barometers we use to measure our success in cultivating the best talent is the performance of Omnicom's work for clients in award shows. In the third quarter, at the 2017 Spikes Asia Festival of Creativity, Omnicom agencies continued to be the most creatively awarded in the industry. BBDO received the nights' top honors by winning Network of the Year, and Clemenger BBDO and Colenso BBDO placing second and third in Agency of the Year category.","Media Agency of the Year was awarded to PHD New Zealand, with OMD Singapore placing second. Omnicom agencies took home seven Grand Prix awards, more than any other holding company, in digital, direct, film, healthcare, PR and entertainment, as well as the only Creative Effectiveness award.","In total, 20 Omnicom agencies in 15 countries contributed to more than a 130 Spike awards with work from 50 different clients.","Our ability to win these awards reflects our outstanding creativity and talent. I want to congratulate our people on their efforts and their accomplishments. And in the area of diversity, we're very pleased that Omnicom was once again designated as a best place to work for the LGBTQ community by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.","Turning now to our operations, we continue to make very good progress on our real estate information technology, back office and accounting services and procurement initiatives. Through these programs, we're enhancing our platforms, systems and controls and reducing costs. Our success in streamlining operations as contributed to the margin improvement we have achieved this year.","In closing, we are pleased with our financial performances in the nine months of 2017. And in an uncertain environment, we are well positioned to deliver on our targets for the full year.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at third quarter results. Phil?","Philip Angelastro","Thank you, John, and good morning. While, our business has continued to operate in the challenging marketplace, our agencies once again did well in meeting the financial and strategic goals we set for them.","Total revenue for the third quarter was $3.7 billion with organic revenue growth of 2.8% that brings our year-to-date organic growth to 3.5%, due to a slightly weakening of the dollar against the currencies in our significant foreign markets. FX positively impacted our revenue by 1% in the third quarter.","We also continue to experience of reduction relative to prior periods, and our reported revenues resulting from the disposition of several businesses that did not set our strategic priorities. This included Novus, our specialty print media business as well as certain agencies within our field marketing and events discipline. These dispositions net of our recent acquisitions reduced our third quarter revenue by $216 million or 5.7%.","I'll go in to greater detail regarding the changes in our revenue in a few minutes. Looking at the income statement items below revenue, operating profit or EBIT for the quarter increased 2.4% to $464 million. With EBIT margin improving to 12.5%, a 50 basis point improvement versus Q3 of last year. Similarly, Q3 EBITDA increased to $492 million and the resulting EBITDA margin of 13.2% also represents a 50 basis point increase over Q3 2016.","Main drivers of our margin improvement continued to be our ongoing efforts to improve cost efficiencies throughout the organization, which are focused on real estate, back office services, and procurement initiatives, as well as the positive impact on margins from the dispositions of several businesses late last year and early this year.","For the balance of the year, we'll continue to expect that our dispositions will negatively impact our reported revenue and EBIT dollars. With the modest benefit of approximately 20 basis points to our overall EBIT margins.","Now turning to the items below operating profit. Net interest expense for the quarter was $46.4 million, up $4.4 million versus Q3 last year, and up $1.1 million versus the second quarter of 2017, versus Q2 interest expense increased $2.2 million, primarily driven by reduction in the benefit from our fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as well as an increase in interest rates.","All interest income increased $1.1 million due to an increase in cash held by our international treasury centers relative to Q2, versus the third quarter of last year the increase in interest expense of $6.1 million was primarily driven by reduction in the benefit from our fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as well as the increase in our commercial paper interest rates. This was partially offset by an increase in interest income of $1.7 million, while our cash balances held were down slightly versus last year, an increase in interest rates positively impacted income for the quarter.","Turning to income tax expense, as you recall at the beginning of the year, we're required to adopt ASU 2016-09, which change the way income tax expenses recognized on share-based compensation under U.S. GAAP.","Newly implemented standard requires that the difference between the book tax expense and the cash tax deduction recorded on our tax return from share-based compensation, we've recognized as income tax expense. This difference is generated as a result of our stock price on the date of the award compared to the stock price on either the date that restricted stock vests or the date that stock options are exercised.","In the past on the GAAP is difference for us was recorded directly to equity and not to the P&L. The standard requires prospect of recognition and does not allow restatement of prior periods.","As a result under the new standard, we recorded an additional tax benefit on share-based compensation of $4.8 million during the third quarter, which reduced our quarterly effective tax rate by 1.1% to 31.6%, and our year-to-date effective rate to 31.1%. Excluding the benefit from the adoption of the new accounting standard, our year-to-date effective tax rate would have been 32.6%, the same as the year-to-date rate for 2106, and in line with our expectations of 2017's full-year tax rate.","Earnings from our affiliates were $1.1 million during the third quarter, down a little from $1.4 million in Q3 of 2016. And the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased slightly to $23.3 million. As a result of the foregoing items, our net income for the quarter increased by about $10 million or 3.9%, $263.6 million versus $253.8 million in Q3 of 2016.","Now turning to the calculation of earnings per share for the third quarter on Slide 2. Net income available for common shareholders for the quarter was $263.3 million. Our net share repurchases made over the past year reduced our diluted share count by 2.5%, 232.7 million shares.","As a result, our reported diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.13, up $0.07 or 6.6% versus diluted EPS of $1.06 from Q3 of last year. Q3 2017, the impact of the new income tax accounting standard increased our diluted EPS by about $0.02, because the final income tax benefit is based on Omnicom's share price at the future vesting date for restricted stock and at the exercise date for stock options. It is not possible to estimate with any degree of certainty the impact the new accounting pronouncement will have on our income tax rate, our net income, or our diluted EPS going forward.","Please note that in future periods this impact could be positive or negative based on movements in our stock price. 2017 almost all of our share-based awards are restricted stock have vested for this year. As a result, the impact in the fourth quarter of the year is expected to be minor.","On Slide 3 and 4, we provide the summary P&L, EPS, and other information for the year-to-date period. I will just give you few highlights, organic growth increased revenue by 3.5% during the first nine months of the year, while the FX headwind reduced revenue by 0.5% and the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions reduced revenue by $413 million or 3.7%.","As a result, for the year-to-date period, revenue totaled $11.1 billion, a decrease of 0.7%, when compared to the first nine months of 2016. Operating profit or EBIT through nine months totaled $1.44 billion or EBITDA was $1.53 billion both increase in 2.3% versus last year. And our operating margins and EBITDA, an increased 40 basis points for the nine months compared to last year.","And on Slide 4, you can see our year-to-date diluted EPS was $3.55 per share, which is up $0.24 or 7.3% versus 2016. Year-to-date the impact of the new accounting standard increased our diluted EPS by $0.08.","Moving to the details of our revenue performance for the quarter, which starts on Slide 5. During the quarter for the first time since 2014, the net impact of the changes in currency rates had a positive impact on our revenue, adding 1% or $39 million. For financial reporting purposes major driver of our FX movement in the third quarter versus last year was the euro, which strengthened 5.7% against the dollar.","In addition to the movement of the euro, the dollar weakened against the Australian dollar, and the Canadian dollar as well as several other currencies. The dollar also strengthened against the Japanese yen, British pound, and the Turkish lira.","Over the past several quarters for financial reporting purposes, we experienced significant FX headwinds resulting from the decline of the British pound after the Brexit vote in June of 2016. We have now cycled through that significant year-over-year decline. If currencies stay where they currently are, based on our most recent projections, the net impact of FX is expected to be positive by approximately 2% in the fourth quarter, which would result in the impact of FX for the full year being flat.","The impact of our recent acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by $216 million in the quarter or 5.7%. As we have discussed, we completed several dispositions over the past 12 months, including the disposition this past April of Novus, our specialty print media business, which was located in the U.S and Canada.","While we will continuously evaluate our portfolio of businesses, at this time we do not anticipate any additional significant dispositions during the remainder of 2017. Our current expectations are that the impact of acquisitions net of our disposition activity will reduce revenue by approximately 4.75% in the fourth quarter, and as a result by approximately 4% for the year.","Organic growth was positive 2.8% or $106 million this quarter. Some highlights of our organic growth this quarter include geographically we had a solid performance in the UK and Continental Europe. And our North American agencies performed better in the quarter with growth of 2.1%.","Our media offerings, including PHD and Hearts & Science, continue to perform very well, offset by some challenges faced by OMD. And Omnicom Healthcare Group had a solid performance at both its domestic and international agencies.","On Slide 6, we present our regional mix of business. And you can see during the third quarter, the split was just under 57% for North America, about 10% for the UK, 18% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, 3% for Latin America and 2% for Africa and the Middle East.","Turning to the details of our performance by region on Slide 7, in North America, organic revenue growth was up 2.1%. While this was an improvement over recent quarters, the performance remains mixed across disciplines. We saw solid growth in our media, healthcare and events businesses, while our branding, direct marketing, point of sale and PR agencies underperformed.","In the UK, organic growth was up 3.8%. While most of our businesses in the market continue their solid performance, overall organic growth was tempered by sluggish results from our field marketing and direct marketing businesses. The rest of Europe continues to perform well, up 7.8% organically in the quarter.","All of the significant markets within Eurozone were positive organically, including strong performance in Germany France and Spain. We also saw solid performance by agencies in the smaller Euro markets, including Italy and Portugal. And The Netherlands had slightly positive organic growth in the quarter.","Organic growth in Europe, outside the Eurozone was positive in most markets, except for Turkey, which had negative growth. The Asia-Pacific region was up 1.4%. Solid performances throughout the region, including in India, Japan and Singapore, were offset by some softness in China.","Turning to Latin America, Brazil's economic issues continue to overshadow solid performances elsewhere in the region, with negative organic growth 5.4% in the quarter. While the comparison for Brazil Q3 of 2016 was inherently difficult due to an uptick in marketing activity last year as a result of the Rio Olympics, the ongoing macroeconomic issues continue to represent a significant challenge for our agencies there.","Outside of Brazil, our agencies in Mexico and Colombia had strong performances. And finally, Africa and the Middle East, which was our smallest region was down 1.6%, largely due to decreases in project-based CRM businesses and a difficult comparison to last year.","Slide 8 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter, split was 52% for advertising services and 48% for marketing services. As for their organic growth performance, our advertising discipline was up 4.7%. Growth continues to be led by our media businesses, both domestically and internationally, and solid performances from certain of our full-service advertising agencies.","CRM was up marginally for the quarter, with mixed results across our businesses and regions. Within CRM, our branding, direct marketing and point-of-sale businesses lagged, while our events businesses had a strong quarter. PR was slightly negative this quarter, driven mainly by weakness in the U.S. which saw a difficult comp due to the benefit last year of the presidential election.","Specialty communications was up 5.1% organically, driven by the performance of our healthcare agencies here in the U.S. and across most international markets. Turning to Slide 9, we present our mix of revenue by our clients' industry sector.","When comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2017 to 2016, you can see a slight shift in the percentages each industry contributed toward our total, with autos and food and beverage increasing, while the contribution from the consumer products and travel and entertainment industries decreasing.","Turning to our cash flow performance, on Slide 10, you can see that in the first nine months of the year, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of free cash flow including changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 11, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $388 million. The year-over-year change reflects the effects of the 10% increase in the quarterly dividend that was approved last year, partially offset by the reduction in shares outstanding due to repurchase activity.","Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $87 million. And capital expenditures were $108 million, up slightly this year.","Acquisitions including earn-out payments, net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments totaled $87 million. And stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $514 million. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by $13 million during the first nine months of the year.","Turning to Slide 12, regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at September 30 was $4.97 billion. Net debt at the end of September was just over $3.1 billion, in line with our prior year levels and an increase of about $1.2 billion since the beginning of the year, resulting from the use of working capital that normally occurs in the first nine months of the year, which was approximately $1.3 billion.","This increase in net debt was partially offset by the effect of exchange rates on cash over the past nine months, which increased our cash balance by $196 million.","As for our ratios, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3 times, and as a result of the year-over-year increase in our gross interest expense, our interest coverage ratio decreased 10.8 times, but still remains very strong.","Turning to Slide 13, we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of internal development initiatives and reasonably priced acquisitions. In the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio moved to 20.2%, while our return on equity ratio was 48.9%, both increased from last year.","And finally, on Slide 14, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10 years. The line on the top of the chart, those are cumulative net income from the beginning of 2007 through September 30, 2017, which totaled $10.7 billion. While the bar shows the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both net share repurchases and dividends, which during the same period totaled $11.3 billion, all resulting in a cumulative payout ratio in excess of 100% since the beginning of 2007.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. I guess, John, looking at the U.S. organic revenue growth, which has been - which looks a bit better this quarter, I mean, do you believe that some of the headwinds that had caused the organic growth last few quarters to soften have sort of lessened a bit? Or is it really too soon to tell that you've kind of turned the corner there?","I guess, just in other words, putting it very plainly, I mean, do we see better - discontinuation of improvement in U.S. organic growth in the quarters ahead?","John Wren","Yes is the answer to your question. We've been dragged down by a couple of specific things. Our branding business, where we just changed management and it takes a little bit of time to go out and sell those projects, but it's not a very long lead-time. So I fully expect that in the first quarter, that headwind will be removed from us and I'm looking forward to that.","Direct marketing has been a problem in the last several quarters, creating a headwind. And with the addition of Luke and some other people, we've changed the management team and the approach in that area and I'm looking for pretty immediate improvement in that regard, because we've spoken to Luke for a very long time and he's been with us since July.","The third other area, which isn't a problem on a worldwide basis, but in the U.S. what we have and this won't change. It's just an explanation. If you look at Accuen programmatic side of the business a lot of clients and we've actually pushed this into the operating branch within the media company.","We haven't lost clients, but we changed the way that we do business with them with a fully disclosed method. And that cost us probably 0.2% in the United States in this past quarter. So some of the problems that you see in explanations that you receive from our competitors, we have a different set of problems and we've addressed ourselves to the largest ones and we'll continue to do so.","Alexia Quadrani","And then just on PR is there anything sort of influenced that segment that, that could be addressed or is that just more of a cyclical thing, where you're seeing some periods of weakness, but it's going to bounce back like other parts of your business?","John Wren","I expect that will bounce back. People are changing the product to meet the market. And there's probably one unit in particular where there still has to be more management changes which haven't occurred yet.","Philip Angelastro","There is also a little bit of election benefit in the 2016 third quarter and fourth quarter results, Alexia, that from a comparability perspective the comp in Q3 and Q4 of 2016 is a little more challenging than normal.","Alexia Quadrani","And then, Phil, just maybe one last one, on the - sounds like you guys had the majority of dispositions within the first four months of the year, so do you happen to have a sort of a just a rough idea of how much of those dispositions, how much they benefit organic growth in the quarter?","John Wren","How much they benefit organic growth or\u2026?","Alexia Quadrani","Yeah, because they were - I assume they were lower growth businesses, getting rid of them would add a little bit of lift to organic growth if at all.","John Wren","It actually has no impact on organic growth, Alexia.","Alexia Quadrani","Okay.","John Wren","They get carved out.","Alexia Quadrani","Perfect. Okay, thank you very much.","John Wren","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Roch from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julien Roch","Yes, good morning. My first question is Accuen contribution to Q3 organic. Did I understand correctly, John, you said there was a 20-basis-point negative? That's my first question. The second one is on working cap, $1.3 billion negative after nine months. I know the seasonality is going to get better in Q4, but that is $500 million worse than last year. So what's happening and maybe if you could give us a full year guidance? That's my second question.","And then on Q4, you say it was the hardest quarter to guide to, because you had $200 million to $250 million of kind of project-based revenue. Could we get a feel of the last kind of 10 years, what has been the worst year and the best year of those project-base? Does it go as low as 100 million and as high as 400, so we can gauge the volatility of Q4? Thank you.","John Wren","Sure, I think I've used the exact language that I used this morning for the past 10 years, because we went back and looked at the scripts of what I said. So it is very much the nature of our business. There was only one year I believe where it didn't come through and that was 2007, I'm looking - 2008 after the great crash or great recession.","We always - we are conservative. We typically get some of that, if not, all of it back. But we can't - as I said, we don't have visibility as to when some of these projects are going to occur. It's $200 million on a $4-billion-plus base, so it's a struggle right up until the end of the year. The only complicating factor I see over and above individual companies having difficulties or individual companies wanting to promote things is a lovely U.S. government and what they can do to disrail progress on any given day, let alone [indiscernible]. I'll let Phil answer your other two questions.","Philip Angelastro","Yeah, so the Accuen numbers, Julien, the U.S. number or the impact on U.S. was basically negative $9 million and the overall worldwide number was growth of around $2 million, so roughly flat globally and the negative in the U.S.","John Wren","Right, $9 million would have been 0.3%, so would have changed 2.8 to 3.1.","Philip Angelastro","The working capital numbers, essentially some of the issue in Q3 is timing, but some of it is frankly underperformance on our part. I think the bottom line is we ultimately need to do a better job on the blocking and tackling, which is what working capital management comes down to. And we need to do that on an agency-by-agency, region-by-region basis. So it needs to - it needs a much greater focus in the fourth quarter which it typically gets.","And frankly, we've been working on that already and we'll be very focused on it in the months to come.","Julien Roch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Stabler","Good morning, one for John and one for Phil if I could. First, John, could you step back and help us a little bit on CRM. You called out branding, some of the management changes and some of the weakness. But when we look back over the last couple of years in CRM and marketing services in general, it lagged. Could you help us understand, kind of looking forward, your expectations? Do you think CRM can reach parity levels of growth with traditional advertising?","And then a quick one for Phil, on North America with the sequential improvement any, say, really significant or large events in North America that you would call out or was this kind of a more balanced improvement across those leverage you mentioned? Thanks so much.","John Wren","CRM, the way that we group companies and services in what we present to you includes things like direct marketing, it includes digital operations, it includes events, it includes a number of other companies. As we didn't say this clearly, but, for instance, we've broken out direct marketing and our digital businesses under the leadership of one particular individual this past quarter. There are other events, I mean, other actions that we're planning to take to look at that category and leadership without the companies within that category. And those will be done in the coming months as soon as we identify the right leaders.","Principally in the past, the people overseeing those weren't experts in a particular craft. The change that we've been going through over the course of the last year is to change the leadership for the group to somebody who is expert in the craft. And we are starting to see progress as a result of making those changes, and we are going to continue to do that and hopefully will be done with it.","I said in my remarks, we'd be done by the middle of next year. I hope to be done sooner than that. And then it takes a little bit of time for the individual to get their arms around the operation, to start to make contribution.","So CRM has taken the hits. Some of them have very large companies in them. Some of them have, as I said, there is a - in the field marketing there is some of our outsourcing businesses and shopper promotion.","So those are other areas, which when they get projects they tend to be large projects and when - if they don't get a project, you feel they're paying in a much more severe way than if an advertising agency lost a particular client. So I don't know if that helps, but that's the reality of it all.","Philip Angelastro","Yeah, I mean the overall goal, Peter, with the practice areas, especially in CRM, is when you get to disciplines like direct marketing, which John talked about, branding, shopper, events businesses, it's essentially to better align the people, the agencies and the resources within a discipline, so that we can better leverage investments across those agencies that are in the same business and the same discipline as well as strengthen new business development efforts, grow the practice area in a more cohesive way. And a big part of it is also to help improve the coordination of the groups within or the agencies within that discipline and link them to our overall top client matrix growth strategy.","So we want to drive a larger share of wallet with our largest clients. And we think the practice area is going to help us improve, when it comes to coordination and integration in that front. Specifically your question on North America, I think we mentioned the larger items, because in reality there are some ups and downs. So the healthcare and events, and the media businesses did well, some of the advertising brands did well, some of the advertising brands did not do as well in North America.","And then the branding and direct marketing businesses as well as PR had a down quarter in North America. So it was kind of a mix of a number of pluses and a number of minuses.","Peter Stabler","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Janedis from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis","Hi, thank you. John, maybe one for you and a quick housekeeping one for Phil. I know it's early, but as you're heading to the end of the year, can you talk about the tone from your large global clients? Are they getting more or less constructive in terms of the outlook? And I think you've talked about some challenges in certain end markets, has that changed?","And then quickly for Phil, how are we thinking about the buyback business, slowing in the quarter, meaning 3Q suggest that there may be some potential M&A or is more just a timing issue?","John Wren","Well, I have to say every one of my major clients is because of their growth rates and purchase they have on their businesses are looking for innovation, change and simplicity. And so that is something we've been dealing with at a pace for the last several years, and I don't see any - I don't see that changing anytime soon. So we are required to change your businesses to make the more agile, to make the more responsive to the clients' needs.","And in many cases, organize them in such a way that we eliminate the complexity of management of those combined businesses to individual client needs. I mean, one of the reasons is - many of the reasons we did the divestitures, we've done over the course of the last year, as we took a lookout three, five years these are still good businesses, but we didn't see them as part of our group making a positive contribution in years out.","One the reasons you see us breaking up some of the categories we refer to, they're not small by any means, but to get craft leadership on top of them is to make our workforce in those particular areas more nimble, perhaps somebody that is only focused on transformation of businesses or first party data. And that's all they do, they don't also worry about outsourcing other things. They have all their time to go out and hunt for new business and new opportunities, and to change the portfolio of what they're responsible for. So it is more reflective of what the clients are saying today.","So we're working on all these things, but we don't expect a break in the action for anybody to give us six months past to get the changes in place, we're doing this, as we are running the company.","Philip Angelastro","On the buyback question and M&A, I think you should expect us to take the same consistent approach in terms of our free cash flow. I think, as we approach the fourth quarter and look at 2018 from capital allocation perspective. I think, we've got a good M&A pipeline, some deals we've been look at for an extended period of time. But we are pretty disciplined about our process.","And to the extent that we can find attractive deals that meet our strategic requirements, and are a good cultural fit, and we think we can integrate them well. And we can get them - we can get agreement on a reasonable - at a reasonable price, we're going to do those deals. We're ideally going to do more of those deals than less. And we're going to use the balance of the free cash flow to buy back shares. I think, in the fourth quarter, specifically, we're going to see what we can get close before year end, and adjust the buyback up or down as a result.","John Janedis","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thanks. Good morning. John, I think, with all said and done, you'll have sold assets this year or dispose of assets representing, I think about $500 million of revenue. When you look at your business going into 2018, particularly your earlier comments on CRM and PR, are there things you guys are considering that might not be strategic or may not help the portfolio longer term or do you feel like you've really pruned as much as you want at this point when you look at the landscape?","John Wren","I'd have to say, we're substantially done. We are - is a couple more small businesses that I get the right exit price for them, I'd let them go, but it won't have the kind of impact on the overall performance reported numbers that going through this year, first quarter of next year. But by and large, as I said, we are substantially done. We'll refocus more on - much more focused on acquisitions, as Phil said. And there's a number of them that look promising whether or not, as Phil said, we'll be able to complete them at prices and terms that make them part of the family. That's the remaining question, but we're working pretty hard, trying to close them by the end of the year.","Benjamin Swinburne","Okay. It's just the follow-up actually tying time sort of M&A to whatever is happening on the consultant front. I know for the most part you and your holding company peers have not seen any material impact on your business to date from the move by the Accentures and the IBMs of the world on organic growth.","I'm just curious, if you're seeing them show up in the same deal flow around M&A, because it does seem like at least there is flowing capital on the acquisition side more and more?","John Wren","We're not really seeing them to any extent, I mean, they are big headlines, Three Monkeys in Australia, I looked at that five years ago, I think it has $26 million of revenue and it's in Australia. It makes a global headline, but it's not. But Australian companies are not seeing them in Australian pitches, I mean, [to put that way] [ph]. So they've got a lot of resources, they can do what they want, and we would never ever cut them short, or think that they could someday figure it out.","I've heard the best idea from Accenture, if they want to do this type of - do what we do, they can come and offer to buy the best and the brightest of us.","Benjamin Swinburne","There you go. Okay. Thank you.","Philip Angelastro","Operator, I think given the market's going to open, we probably have time to just one more question.","Operator","Okay. The question comes from the line of Steven Cahall from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Steven Cahall","Thanks. Maybe just two for me. The first just on some industry verticals. I think, I've heard, when I was last in Europe that the customer products companies there had under-spent a little bit on their advertising in the first half of the year. And we're picking some of that up in the second half of the year. So I was wondering, you could comment at all on what you're seeing in the consumer staples market and if any of those sort of blue chip companies were seeing a positive inflection here in the back half of the year.","And then also on the media business, you called that out a couple of times as a source of strength in your advertising business. I was wondering, if you could just discuss overall how big that is as a percentage of revenue of the company, and also what growth rate you're seeing in your media business. Thank you.","John Wren","It's rumored to your first question. When I was in Europe last week or week before, that - in speaking to a few CEOs that they will spend more principally through their cost cutting efforts and they don't want to lose more market share. And they're competing against new competitors just as almost every major businesses. So we're hoping that, that they turn the conversation into budgets. But until they do, we can't claim victory.","Philip Angelastro","Yeah, in terms of the specifics around the media business, we don't go through and break out that in detail. I think the thing to keep in mind is that there has been a lot of change over the last few years, especially recently, and a lot of integration in media, traditional advertising and other parts of our business. You can see that in some of the wins we've recently had, take AT&T as an example. And, yeah, there are other parts of our businesses that have media as a component. Certain markets for example like Brazil, media is integrated with advertising, you can't have a standalone media business.","I think overall though, the advertising discipline largely reflects a combination of our traditional advertising agencies and media businesses. And we're particularly happy with the investments we made starting seven or eight years ago in the Annalect platform that's helped drive some of the big wins we had over the last few years. And as we integrate that more and more into all of our disciplines, not just the traditional advertising businesses, we think it puts us in a really good position, competitively did to win more than our fair share of new businesses going forward.","John Wren","I think, Phil, summed it up earlier in a word, where our objective is a share of wallet. We want to service clients in their marketing needs as much as we can with the skills and the disciplines we have in the company irrespective of what silo they may be sitting in.","Steven Cahall","Thank you.","Philip Angelastro","Okay. Thank you everybody for joining the call. We appreciate it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"16320":["Omnicom Group Inc.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Shub Mukherjee. Please go ahead.","Shub Mukherjee","[Technical Difficulty] Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer. We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release. We have posted to www.omnicomgroup.com this morning\u2019s press release along with the presentation covering the information that we will review this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I\u2019ve been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our presentation, and to point out, that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectation and that actual events or results may differ materially. I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom\u2019s performance.","You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation material. We are going to begin this morning\u2019s call with an overview of our business from John Wren, then Phil Angelastro will review our financial results for the quarter, and then, we will open the line for your questions.","John Wren","Thank you, Shub. Good morning. Thank you for joining the call this morning. I\u2019m pleased to speak with you about our fourth quarter and the full year 2019 results. Our fourth quarter performance was very solid with organic growth of 3.5%. For the year, organic growth was 2.8%.","We also exceeded our margin targets for the quarter and for the year. EBIT margin for the quarter increased 30 basis points to 15.6%. For the year, EBIT margin was up 40 basis points to 14.2%, excluding the effect of our third quarter 2018 dispositions and repositioning actions.","And EPS for the quarter was up 6.8% to $1.89 per share. In the face of a dynamic yet challenging environment, I\u2019m very pleased that our strategies, talent and execution have allowed us to consistently deliver solid financial results. I will speak more about our achievements in these areas later in my remarks. But let me first provide more color on our financial performance.","Looking at fourth quarter organic growth across the disciplines, Advertising and Media was up 5.1%, CRM Consumer Experience was up 3.3%, Healthcare was up 12.9%, PR was down 2.5%, and as expected, CRM Execution & Support was down 6%.","By region, the U.S. was up 2.8%, driven by solid results in Advertising and Media, and CRM Consumer Experience. And we had double-digit growth in Healthcare. CRM Execution & Support was down double-digits in the U.S. and Public Relations also had negative growth. The UK was up 3.3%. Advertising and Media, Healthcare and PR performed well, offset by weaker performance in both of our CRM disciplines.","Overall growth in the euro and non-euro region was 4.7%. Results in the euro markets was mixed. Germany and Spain performed well. France had negative growth as it continued to be impacted by weak performance in our specialty print production business. Our events business was also negative due to difficult comps.","The non-euro markets performed quite well overall, led by the Czech Republic and Russia. Asia Pacific growth was 4.5%, as China and Australia had good results in the quarter. Latin America was down 1.3% due to challenges in Brazil and Chile. Our smallest region, the Middle East and Africa was up 19.5%.","Looking at our cash flow in 2019, Omnicom generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow and returned more than $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Approximately $120 million in cash was used for acquisition related spend during the year. At this point, our acquisition pipeline is good and we expect activity to pick up in 2020.","Our plans for the use of free cash flow remains unchanged, paying our dividends, pursuing strategic acquisitions and repurchasing our shares. Finally, our balance sheet and credit ratings remain very strong.","Turning now to our strategy and operations, we are focused on key strategic objectives that have consistently served us well. These strategies are centered around hiring and retaining the best talent; driving organic growth by evolving and expanding our service offerings; investing in areas of growth with a particular focus on data, analytics, digital transformation, CRM and Precision Marketing, e-commerce and Healthcare; and remaining vigilant on managing our cost and improving operational efficiencies in areas such as real estate, accounting, purchasing and IT.","To meet our clients\u2019 desire for simplicity and to be better able to recruit and deliver the best talent to them, we\u2019ve structured our service offerings around our practice areas and our Global Client Leaders Group.","The Global Client Leaders Group provides clients a single point of access to our network of thousands of industry specialists in a variety of marketing disciplines. From late 2017 through early 2019, we established 12 practice areas, including CRM and Precision Marketing, Advertising, Media, Public Relations, Retail, Branding, Healthcare, Experiential and several others.","The practice areas bring together strong expertise within a particular discipline, provide our people greater opportunities for training and development, better match the needs of our clients with our service offerings, and help develop strategies for internal investments and acquisitions.","Together, the global client and practice area leaders can deliver expertise and talent to our clients that is aligned with their business strategies and can tackle their marketing challenges. One of our longstanding practice areas, which is very well aligned with our Global Client Leaders Group is Omnicom Health Group. This group had an outstanding year, which contributed to our overall growth in 2019.","Omnicom Health Group is one of the largest healthcare communications groups in the world. The group services over 250 different client companies including the top-25 pharma and biotech companies in the world. Omnicom Health Group is able to manage communications across the entire healthcare ecosystem, due to its breadth and depth of specialty healthcare agencies that are focused on 4 key healthcare customers: healthcare professionals, payer organizations, patients and consumers, and medical experts and regulatory stakeholders.","The group\u2019s success is driven by its talent. In 2019, the group added 300 healthcare specialists to its roster, which now numbers more than 4,300 people. Omnicom Health Group has invested in training and up-skilling its people in healthcare marketing through programs such as its Oncology University.","The group\u2019s success is also due to its use of our data and analytical tools. Over the past year, it has begun to use Omni, our people-based precision marketing and insights platform, to better understand healthcare professionals and patients\u2019 online behavior.","In doing so, Omnicom Health Group has successfully created more insightful, targeted and personalized communication strategies for its clients. All our agencies have access to our data and analytics tools, which we\u2019ve invested in for over a decade. Omni is now available globally in the majority of markets in which we operate.","Omni\u2019s open platform allows us to continually evolve and expand its capabilities to serve the specific needs of our agencies and clients. As an example, our pioneering cultural consultancy, sparks & honey, recently launched Q, the first of its kind SaaS platform that combines human and AI-powered intelligence to help organizations predict change before it disrupts their business. The capabilities of Q are fully embedded within Omni.","While data and analytics remain a top investment priority for us, we understand that data can only take us so far. It is our IP, our creativity that truly sets us apart. It is creativity and innovation, informed by data and analytics that will drive the most meaningful business results. One barometer we use to measure our success in cultivating the best talent in the strength of our agency brands is the performance of our client work and award shows. Here are a few recent highlights.","Omnicom was named Holding Company of the Year by MediaPost for the second year in a row, while BBDO won Agency of the Year. The Eurobest 2019, 2 of our networks were in the top 3, with BBDO coming in first and DDB coming in third. In addition, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO took the top spot for Agency of the Year and DDB Paris came in second. PHD also won Media Network of the Year for the second in a row. Critical Mass was named Customer Engagement Agency of the Year and Campaign U.S. Agency of the Year award.","In the PRWeek\u2019s inaugural Purpose Awards, Porter Novelli was named Agency of the Year. None of these awards would have been possible without our top notch agency brands. The rich history and well established cultures have shaped our industry for decade, and we applaud the award winning work they create year-after-year for our clients. We remain steadfast in believing in the value of our individual brands, and we\u2019ll continue to support their unique cultures and go-to-market strategies.","It is the people within our agencies, who make Omnicom what it is today. And our commitment to attracting, retaining and developing talent remains our top priority. This includes fostering diverse and inclusive workplaces, where all employees feel comfortable, confident and supported. While this is a longstanding and continuous effort, 2019 set several milestones that highlight our dedication and commitment.","In 2019, we were recognized Fortune Magazine as one of only 6 Fortune 500 companies that have more women than men on its Board of Directors. The Wall Street Journal also recently released its own diversity and inclusion ranking of companies in the S&P 500, and I\u2019m proud to say that we were tied for third. In addition, Omniwomen, our employee resource group, continue to serve as a catalyst for increasing the influence and number of women leaders throughout the Omnicom network. The program currently has 14 chapters globally and we\u2019ll be hosting several events across the globe in honor of the upcoming International Women\u2019s Day on March 8.","In May 2019, we launched OPEN DisAbility + Allies. The launch of this group when hand-in-hand with our ongoing strategic partnership with The Valuable 500, a global initiative putting disability inclusion on business leadership\u2019s agenda.","Finally, for the 4th consecutive year, Omnicom received a perfect score on the Corporate Equality Index conducted by the Human Rights Campaign, which highlights our commitment to an inclusive work force and designates us as a 2020 Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality. I\u2019m extremely proud of our leadership teams and all our people for these achievements. In addition to our employee resource groups, we continue to invest in our talent development programs.","In December, we announced the appointment of Karen van Bergen as Dean of Omnicom University, our longstanding management development program. Karen previously served as CEO of Omnicom\u2019s PR Group. 2019 marked the 25th anniversary of this prestigious program. From its modest beginnings in Boston with only one program, we\u2019ve expanded Omnicom University to 12 programs a year on 3 continents with nearly 5,400 global alumni. It is considered one of the preeminent professional development programs in our industry. Our strong financial performance underpins the outstanding work of our people and agencies. We look forward to continued success in the year ahead.","In closing, we\u2019re pleased with our performance for Q4 and the full year 2019, and I\u2019m confident that we are well positioned as we enter 2020.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the results.","Philip Angelastro","Thanks, John, and good morning. John just described, fourth quarter results represented a very solid end of the year for us, reflecting the quality of our employees and the services they deliver to help our clients achieve their goals. And for the full year, our results were in line with the upper end of the range of our expectations. As always, our agencies remain focused on responding to our clients\u2019 ever changing requirements and delivering effective solutions to meet their needs, and at the same time, managing their agency cost structures in an efficient manner. We also continue to see the positive effects of our ongoing company-wide efforts to identify opportunities for improvement and efficiencies.","Starting on Slide 7. Regarding our revenue for the fourth quarter, we had organic growth of 3.5% as our agencies overall did a good job capturing the year-end client project spend. For the full year, organic growth was 2.8%, which was at the upper end of the range of our expectation of 2% to 3% growth, as we had positive performance across most regions and major markets.","FX was once again negative reducing our revenue by 0.9% in the fourth quarter. And while the reduction in revenue from dispositions made during the last 12 months exceeded revenue from acquisitions in the quarter and net reduction of 1.2% this quarter is lower than it was in the previous four quarters as we cycle through the largest tranche of our 2018 dispositions during the third quarter. As a result, our reported revenue in the fourth quarter increased 1.3% to $4.14 billion when compared to Q4 of last year. I\u2019ll discuss the components of the changes in revenue in more detail later in my comments.","Turning back to Slide 1, our operating profit for the quarter was $646.4 million, up 3.1% when compared to Q4 of 2018. While our operating margin of 15.6% represented a 30 basis point increase over the last year\u2019s fourth quarter. EBITDA for the quarter increased 2.5% and Q4\u2019s EBITDA margin of 16.1% was up 20 basis points when compared to last year. The improvement in margins when compared to Q4 of last year, primarily resulted from the change in business mix we\u2019ve experienced from the strategic disposition of several noncore or underperforming agencies and our ongoing efforts to be more efficient throughout the organization, particularly in the areas of real estate, back-office operations, IT and procurement.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $38.6 million, down $14.5 million versus Q4 of last year largely driven by the refinancing activity that took place in the third quarter of 2019, and down $10.7 million compared to the third quarter of this year.","As a reminder, I\u2019ll recap the refinancing activity. In early July, we issued \u20ac1 billion senior notes in 2 parts: we issued \u20ac500 million of 8-year senior notes due in 2027 at an effective rate of 0.92%; and an additional \u20ac500 million of 12-year senior notes due in 2031 at an effective rate of 1.53%. Together, the euro note issuance after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, resulted in net proceeds of US$1.1 billion at an average rate of 1.23%.","Proceeds were used to retire the $500 million of 6.25% 2019 senior notes, which came due in mid-July and to retire on August 1, $400 million of 4.45% 2020 senior notes through a partial redemption. As a result of the refinancing activities, our expected ongoing long-term debt portfolio will be comprised of $4 billion in dollar-denominated debt and \u20ac1 billion in euro-denominated debt. In addition, with the drop in long-term interest rates, we settled our fixed-to-floating rate interest swaps for a small gain.","As a result, our debt portfolio is now 100% fixed rate debt at very attractive rates, an effective rate of approximately 3.3%. And total third-party interest expense for the fourth quarter decreased by $15.2 million when compared to Q4 of 2018. In addition, interest income decreased $1.8 million period-over-period with the reduction in interest rates on our cash deposits over the past year more than offset the increase in our cash balances. When compared to the third quarter of 2019, interest expense decreased $10.8 million driven by the refinancing activity in the third quarter, while interest income was flat.","Note, gross interest expense in Q4 was approximately $7.6 million lower than in Q3, because Q3 included incremental net interest expense recorded as a result of the early redemption of $400 million of the 2020 senior notes. For the full year 2020, we expect net interest expense savings of approximately $20 million primarily from the refinancing activity when compared to 2019\u2019s reported results. However, total interest expense for 2020 and going forward will be subject to changes due to the translation of interest expense into U.S. dollars related to the euro notes that we issued in 2019.","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26.1%, bringing the 2019 full year effective tax rate to 26%. As previously discussed, the annual rate for 2019 includes a benefit of approximately $11 million, resulting from the favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in Q2 of 2019.","Heading into 2020, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27%. Before considering the impact of the tax effect from our share-based compensation including the impact of any future stock option exercises, both of which is subject to changes in the value of Omnicom\u2019s stock price.","Earnings from our affiliates were less than $1 million for the quarter, down versus Q4 of last year, primarily due to lower earnings at our affiliates as well as the negative impact of FX. And the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders and our less-than-fully-owned subsidiaries was up $4.3 million to $34.8 million during the quarter due to the strong performance from several of our less-than-fully-owned agencies. As a result, net income for the fourth quarter was $415 million, up 4% or $15.8 million when compared to Q4 of 2018.","Now turning to Slide 2, our diluted share count for the quarter decreased 2.8% versus Q4 of last year to 219.3 million shares. As a result, our diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.89, which is an increase of $0.12 or 6.8% when compared to our Q4 EPS for last year.","Next, I\u2019ll provide a quick recap of the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the full year results. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2018, we closed on the disposition of Sellbytel as well as other dispositions that resulted in a net pre-tax gain of $178 million. At the time, we also recorded charges of $149 million for repositioning actions primarily resulting from severance and lease terminations.","And lastly, we recorded additional tax expense of approximately $29 million, resulting from adjustments of the provisional amounts originally recorded in connection with the 2017 Tax Act. As we reported last year, the net impact of these items on our full year 2018 results increased our reported operating profit by $29 million, net income by $18.2 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.08.","Therefore on Slide 5 and 6, we presented the fiscal 2019 results in comparison to 2018, both with and without the impact of the net gain from dispositions, the repositioning charges and the tax adjustments in connection with the Tax Act. The non-GAAP adjusted amounts for these items show how our underlying business performed year-on-year on a comparable basis, which we believe this meaningful presentation for investors and is consistent with how management measured our 2019 operating performance.","Since the full year results for 2019 were in line with our quarterly performance, I\u2019ll just give you a few headlines. Organic revenue growth for the full year was 2.8%, which was in line with the upper range of our expectations for the year of between 2% and 3%. FX translation decreased revenue by 2.1%. The net impact of acquisitions and dispositions reduced revenue by 2.9%. So for 2019, our reported revenue totaled $14.95 billion, a decrease of 2.2% compared to 2018.","Our reported operating profit for 2019 was $2.12 billion, down slightly when compared to our reported results last year, while operating margin improve 20 basis points year-over-year to 14.2% on a reported basis and 40 basis points after adjusting 2018\u2019s operating income with a net gain from the dispositions and repositioning actions we undertook during Q3 of 2018.","And our full year reported diluted EPS for 2019 was $6.06 a share, up $0.23 or 3.9% compared to the reported amount of $5.83 a share in 2018. Adjusting for the impact of 2018\u2019s net gain from the dispositions, repositioning actions and tax reform activity, 2019\u2019s diluted EPS represents of $0.31 improvement or 5.4% over the 2018 non-GAAP adjusted amount of $5.75 a share.","Turning to the details of our revenue performance in the fourth quarter. Starting on Slide 7, FX once again was negative in the quarter, but not as negative as the impact we saw in the first 9 months of the year. FX reduced revenue by 0.9% in the fourth quarter or $37 million. This impact remains fairly wide spread. On a reported basis consistent with the year-over-year impact, dollar strengthened against practically every one of our major foreign currencies. In the quarter, only the Japanese yen and Russian ruble strengthened against the dollar.","The FX movements creating the largest reductions in the quarter continue to be from changes in the dollar compared to the euro, Chinese yuan, Brazilian real and the Australian dollar. As for our projection of the FX impact for the upcoming year, any assumption on how foreign currency rates will move over the next few months, let alone the balance for 2020, this point is speculative.","But if currencies stay where they currently are, based on our estimates, FX could reduce our reported revenues by approximately 50 basis points in the first quarter and be slightly negative over the balance of 2020. The impact of our recent acquisitions, net of dispositions, decreased revenue by $51 million in the quarter or 1.2%. This is lower than earlier quarters, as we cycle through much of our recent disposition activity during the third quarter of 2019.","Based on transactions completed to date, we estimate the impact of our acquisition activity, net of dispositions will be a net reduction of about 75 basis points in the first quarter of 2020 and close to flat over the remaining 3 quarters of the year, resulting in a projected net negative impact of 25 basis points for the year.","Finally, our organic growth for the quarter was 3.5%, growth this quarter was fairly well distributed and reflective of the positive effects of year-end client project spending. Geographically, our domestic, Asia-Pacific and European regions all had good performances. Within our service disciplines, our Advertising, Media and CRM Consumer Experience agencies, all experienced positive organic growth this quarter. All our CRM Execution & Support and PR agency group once again lagged.","Slide 8 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the fourth quarter, the split was 58% for advertising and 42% for marketing services. As for their organic growth by discipline, our advertising discipline was up 5.1%. We saw solid performances from our global advertising agency networks and several of our regional brands as well as solid performance at our Media businesses.","CRM Consumer Experience was up 3.3% organically, driven by continued strong growth from our precision marketing agencies as well as from our events businesses outside the U.S. CRM Execution & Support was down 6% this quarter across most of the service offerings and discipline. PR was down 2.5%. The reduction is consistent with the performance of our PR discipline throughout earlier quarters in 2019. Lastly, Healthcare was up double digits organically at 12.9%. And the growth continues to be well distributed, both domestically and internationally.","On Slide 9, which details the regional mix of business, you can see during the quarter the split was 52% in the U.S., 3% for the rest of North America, 9% in the UK, 19% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia-Pacific, 3% for Latin America and 3% for the Middle East and Africa markets.","Turning to the details of our performance by region on Slide 10. Organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter in the U.S. was 2.8% led by our CRM Consumer Experience, Healthcare and Advertising and Media disciplines, with our CRM Execution & Support and PR agency group lagging. Outside the U.S., our other North American agencies were down 2.3% due to the sluggish performances at our Advertising and Media businesses.","Our UK agencies were once again positive, up 3.3% driven by the strong performance of our Advertising, PR, Healthcare and field marketing agencies. The rest of Europe was up 4.7% organically in the quarter.","In the euro zone, we saw solid performance across most markets, the strongest being Germany, Belgium, Portugal and Spain. The Netherlands was slightly positive in the quarter, while France was once again negative, driven by continued weak performance in a few of our CRM Execution & Support businesses in that market.","Organic growth outside the euro zone also continues to be positive across most markets. Organic growth in Asia Pacific for the quarter was 4.5%. Our Greater China agencies performed well this quarter, after coming off a poor performance in Q3, primarily driven by growth from our Media and Events agencies on the Mainland.","However, we do not expect this to continue in the first-half of 2020, given the uncertainty in China. Elsewhere in the region, we saw a somewhat mixed performance by market. Solid performance by our agencies in Australia, South Korea and Thailand was partially offset by reductions in Japan and Singapore.","Latin America was down 1.3% organically in the quarter. Brazil once again returned to a negative organic performance as did Chile and Colombia, offsetting some growth in Mexico in the quarter. And lastly, the Middle East and Africa, which is our smallest region, was positive for the quarter with Qatar and the UAE turning in strong performances.","Turning to Slide 11, we present our mix of revenue by our client\u2019s industry sector. As we saw throughout the year, when comparing the full year revenue for 2019 to 2018, there was a small shift in our mix. As a result of the Sellbytel disposition, the mix of revenue from technology clients has been reduced.","Turning to our cash flow performance, on Slide 12 you can see that for the year we generated $1.73 billion of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $564 million, up about $16 million year-over-year.","As you recall, we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.05 a share effective with April\u2019s payment. The increase in the cash payment was partially offset by a reduction in common shares over the past 12 months. Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders totaled $97 million, down versus the prior year, due to a combination of dispositions and the repurchase of shares from our minority shareholders.","Capital expenditures were $102 million year to date, down compared to 2018, primarily due to a reduction in leasehold improvements from our real estate activities year-over-year. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments totaled $124 million. As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, this is a decrease when compared to last year, when we opportunistically executed on several acquisitions.","And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans were $604 million. All in, we generated $239 million in net free cash flow over the past year. On Page 14, we present our capital structure as of yearend, which reflects the changes we discussed earlier, regarding the refinancing actions we took in the third quarter.","Regarding our capital structure at the end of the year, our total debt was $5.14 billion. And our net debt position as of December 31 was $835 million, down almost $400 million from this time last year. Year-on-year the improvement in net debt is primarily due to our positive free cash flow of $239 million and changes in operating capital of $125 million, which includes the year-over-year improvement of $45 million in our working capital management.","As for our debt ratios, they remain solid. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.2 times. And our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.4 times. And our interest coverage is 10.4 times, which has improved over the past year due to the reduction in our interest expense.","And finally, on Slide 15, you can see we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio was 29.5%, while our return on equity was 49.6%.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we\u2019ve included several other supplemental slides on the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we\u2019re going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Alexia Quadrani from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much. My first question is really on more of the detail on the outlook for 2020, if you could give us a sense of how we should be thinking about organic growth and then margin efficiencies that you had highlighted that benefited Q4 and actually full year 2019. Can they continue in 2020? How should we think about profitability as well? Thank you.","Philip Angelastro","I\u2019ll start and then John can add his comments. I think for 2020 in terms of where we are in our planning cycle for the year right now, our expectations are similar to what they were at this point in 2019. So we see an organic growth range of 2% to 3% again for 2020. And with respect to margins, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on growing EBIT dollars. That\u2019s been our focus all along. That\u2019s how we approach planning and executing our business and it\u2019s been successful.","We\u2019re always looking for opportunities for improvement and efficiencies throughout the organization. We\u2019re particularly focused or have been in the last 3 or 4 years in the areas of real estate and back office, and IT. We\u2019re going to continue to do that. And at the same time, we\u2019re going to continue to invest for growth, especially in the areas of data and analytics.","Training and some other initiatives as we always strive to find the right balance between those investments and finding sustainable growth. So for 2020 at this point in our planning cycle, we expect margins to approximate what they were in 2019, so flat for now. And we\u2019ll see how it goes as the year evolves.","Alexia Quadrani","And then, John, can I ask a follow-up question, is you touched on \u2013 or maybe Phil touched on China, Asia and the region in your region in your opening remarks. I\u2019m curious \u2013 I know it\u2019s not a huge market for you. But how are the multinationals sort of dealing with ad-spending in China right now?","And then, just a lot of question for Phil or John, the CRM Execution business, which continues to be a tough area for you, do you see more divestitures there or opportunity to sort of \u2013 I guess, what\u2019s the \u2013 how do we fix that business? Do we get out of some of the businesses or is it a question of sort of just cyclical and then it will come back?","John Wren","First, Alexia, we\u2019ll first take China. We like most other people are playing day to day at this point. Our primary focus is the safety of our employees. January, which we know the results were fine. It wasn\u2019t until after that that this became a full blown public crisis. It depends on how long it goes on.","Our people have been working primarily from home. And work goes on for most clients. Some of them are even spending more because of the products that they\u2019re selling to the marketplace. The one area for the quarter anyway that I think will be affected would be our Events business in China, because so any planned events has been cancelled at this point and we don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be done later in the year or whatever.","But as you said in your comments, China is an important, but it\u2019s not a terribly large market for us in our numbers. And your second question?","Alexia Quadrani","The CRM Execution, just a question if you can do more divestitures there or what\u2019s your outlook really?","John Wren","You want to do it or\u2026?","Philip Angelastro","Sure. I think we\u2019re going to continue to look at the entire portfolio as we through our planning process and all throughout the year. Identify businesses that strategically may make sense for disposition. We\u2019ve been through \u2013 we believe we\u2019ve been through the bulk of that process as far as acquisitions of size. But we\u2019re always open to reconsiderations and there is a lot of change that\u2019s happened in our industry. We expect that change to continue.","We don\u2019t have any particular meaningful businesses targeted to disposition at this point. And we think a bunch of the execution and support businesses that we have are going to get back to being positive growth, maybe not high growth businesses with good returns, with some exceptions. There are some that is still cycling through some of the issues that they faced in 2019.","But the part of the portfolio represents is a smaller part of our portfolio now than it was over the last few years. And some of those businesses are really good businesses and have always been. They\u2019ve overshadowed by some of the underperformers within that group or grouping.","So I think you can expect we\u2019re going to continue to work with the management teams to look for opportunities for growth and improvement and to the extent that we feel strategically we\u2019re not going to continue to invest in them and they\u2019re not \u2013 and they are opportunities for good returns for disposition we may continue to consider going down that route too.","Alexia Quadrani","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question then will come from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Craig Huber","Good morning. Thank you. I\u2019ve got a few questions. Can you just size for us, if you would the China revenues for last year? What percent of revenues that was and what was the organic revenue there? We get that question a lot.","John Wren","The size of China or us is \u2013 it\u2019s probably a little bit less than 1.5% of our revenues. And I think given that size, we typically don\u2019t disclose every country-by-country organic revenue growth percentage, but if you give me a minutes, I\u2019ll just double check it.","So for the year, the year China \u2013 China\u2019s organic growth was negative, so I think in the mid single digits in 2019.","Craig Huber","Thank you for that.","John Wren","Sure.","Craig Huber","My next question, John, I guess, you\u2019ve \u2013 various conversations you\u2019ve had with your larger customers particularly here in the U.S. Just curious, how are the tone of businesses with them? And as you sort of think about the U.S. economy what\u2019s your sort of sense of that? Is it holding you back? Is it helping you? And the same question is for Continental Europe as well? What\u2019s your sense of the economy in both places, please?","John Wren","Sure. Most of the conversations we\u2019ve had, lot of that was clients in the U.S. U.S. economy continues to be strong and clients are trying to take advantage of the growth that they see in the marketplace. Obviously, with the election coming up, there is some cautiousness that goes along with that. But for the most part, I\u2019d have to say it\u2019s a net positive.","Once again into Europe, the markets \u2013 it changes market by market. The real behind-the-scene conversations about Brexit are \u2013 is uncertainty, not so much for 2020, but post-2020, as businesses decide where they have to be positioned and what needs to get done. France is \u2013 the market\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve suffered an individual loss in some of our execution businesses, which affect our numbers, but the market\u2019s okay. In Germany, Germany is a question market at this point. Not a negative, but a question mark, especially since, I think, it was last night, the expected success that Angela Merkel decided she would not be running to that position. So we don\u2019t have any better information at the moment. Russia continues to be a strong performing market for us. I don\u2019t know if that covers most of the things, you want me to cover.","Craig Huber","No, I appreciate that. Every year in the fourth quarter, you tend to have some variability around your project related work, obviously, here in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe size that for us? How did \u2013 in terms of dollars, maybe how you want to do it the fourth quarter of this year versus last year, please?","Philip Angelastro","I think, we typically see as we head into the fourth quarter, there\u2019s somewhere around $200 million to $250 million of project work that is typically available for our agencies to achieve. And our agencies do typically achieve something in that range. Some years, it\u2019s a little bit lower. Some years, they actually do a little bit better. And there is a whole variety of factors, and it\u2019s not just when we speak about that in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s not just our project based businesses alone that are actively pursuing year-end project opportunities with their clients.","So I think, this year was probably similar to maybe a little bit better than last year\u2019s fourth quarter, and I think, if you go back to 2018, it probably wasn\u2019t as good a performance where there wasn\u2019t as much of it that we were able to convert in that fourth quarter. But that\u2019s a typical range that we see, it\u2019s hard to actually put your finger on every dollar, and whether where \u2013 what exactly the client situation was that led to us being able to capture those dollars. So that\u2019s traditionally what we found, and it\u2019s been pretty consistent over the years.","Craig Huber","Got you. Thank you very much.","John Wren","Sure.","Operator","Our next question then will come from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Daniel Salmon","Thanks for taking the questions, and good morning, everyone. John, I was hoping you could comment on the recent news about Accenture reportedly closing their media auditing division. You commented, I think, on that specific issue on prior calls, and I\u2019d love to hear an update on that specifically. But really, more importantly, I\u2019d love to hear just your broader thoughts, particularly as you enter 2020, about the competitive environment and particularly with that group.","And then just you mentioned all the sort of success of the Healthcare division, and the numbers are clearly robust there. I hate to ask about one of the markets that are seeing challenges, but I\u2019d just love to hear an update on the PR division. In particular, just we know that that\u2019s a business where it might have lagged in adopting technology within marketing traditionally, but where it does appear to be really picking up. And I\u2019m wondering how you see the role of technology in helping bring that division back to growth going forward this year. Thanks.","John Wren","Well, first, on Accenture, I did comment, I forget when it was back a while ago that some of their ambitions and the fact they\u2019re still in the media auditing business was inconsistent. And I\u2019m just happy to see that they got out of the business. And we\u2019ll continue to compete with them where we see them, although we haven\u2019t run into them very often on major pitches. Your second question was about Healthcare, and could you just reframe it for me for a second?","Daniel Salmon","Rather you emphasized the strength in Healthcare. What I was hoping to just hear a little bit more about was the PR division and how you aim to get it back to growth. And in particular, the role of technology and whether you\u2019re seeing that become more significant within those businesses?","John Wren","Sure. Well, I think the utilization of Omni and especially Q, which I mentioned in my remarks, will benefit PR business in some of their assignments. The other activity that\u2019s going on \u2013 now let me frame it, even though, we\u2019ve had some difficulty with a couple of percentage points loss here and there, the profitability of the PR division has been and remains very strong. So the opportunity is a marketplace opportunity, it\u2019s not anything structurally to do with the business at this point.","And we\u2019re continuing to go through and evaluate. Recently, John Doolittle took over for Karen van Bergen as the head of that practice area. And we\u2019re sitting down and taking into the hard look at where we get our revenue, what we can expect in the future and what changes we want to make to the business. So it\u2019s an opportunity from my perspective, it\u2019s not really a problem. It\u2019s just constantly running 1% or 2% below the prior year. And technology will help that as well. Q especially, which has just been \u2013 it\u2019s been in development for over 5 years, but it\u2019s just been added to the Omni offering. I believe will particularly help the PR business in some of the things that they\u2019re doing.","Daniel Salmon","Great. Thank you.","John Wren","Sure.","Operator","Our next question then will come from the line of Julien Roch from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julien Roch","Yes. Hi, there. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Coming back on China quickly. You said it was less than 1.5% of revenue and that so far the only impacts were you events business, because no event was taking place in China. How much is events either out of the Chinese revenue or out of the 1.5%? That\u2019s my first question.","The second one is could you give us some color on the organic growth of your media practice in full year 2019? You said it was solid. It\u2019s one of your largest practice, and it\u2019s been the growth engine of agency in the last few years. So organic would be great, and if you don\u2019t want to give a precise number, maybe a range, I don\u2019t know, 2.5% to 5% or 5% to 7.5%? And then last question is on the number of shares. It was flat in Q4. Well, it usually goes down by about 1-plus million a quarter. So what happened in terms of number of shares in Q4? Thank you.","John Wren","I\u2019ll let Phil answer some of these. Are you applying for a job? Because some of the detailed questions are probably questions a few employees that actually look at it. We are not in the business of segregating our businesses in a particular market. We haven\u2019t done in the past, but our events business \u2013 our main business is Media, Advertising and Public Relations in that market. Events add something to it, but I\u2019m not going to get into the dissection of that for disclosure. So I apologize for that. But what was the second? The \u2013 go ahead.","Julien Roch","And then \u2013 no, I mean, if you knew that, I just wanted to have an idea of the growth of media in 2019.","Philip Angelastro","I think overall, it wasn\u2019t disproportionately higher or lower than our overall growth rate. I think, if you go through the numbers we\u2019ve been through on the call. You can see Media, Advertising and Healthcare grew better than the overall portfolio, and some of the overall portfolio, namely PR, CRM Execution & Support, in particular, either didn\u2019t grow. So by that, you can include the 3 that did grow or the primary drivers of our growth grew at a little bit higher rate than our overall average rate for the quarter and the year.","And I think, each of those businesses had a good year and did well and drove our growth overall. But as far as the specific percentages, I think, we provide quite a bit of information to give you a good sense of that. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019re any dramatic \u2013 anything dramatically different about that part of our portfolio.","And some of our Media business is actually in like markets such as Brazil and some others are integrated into the advertizing businesses. They aren\u2019t standalone media businesses, so it\u2019s hard to pull out exactly how much of the growth in those markets came from standalone media versus advertizing, because they are integrated.","And as far as shares go, in the fourth quarter, I\u2019m not quite sure I follow in detail your observation. But we can go through that after the call. I think certainly we bought back through share repurchases as little bit more in the fourth quarter this year than we did in the prior year. And maybe what you\u2019re seeing has something to do with just the way the year-end averages get complied. And we haven\u2019t seen the effects just yet.","Julien Roch","Oh, is that just the timing, because 219.3 diluted number of shares in Q4 and you had 219.4 in Q4? So it\u2019s just the timing of the average then?","Philip Angelastro","Yes, yeah, you kind of \u2013 you will see I think more of that or an acceleration of that effect when you get into 2021as the averages start over.","Julien Roch","Okay, very clear. Thank you very much.","Philip Angelastro","Sure. I think given when the markets open, we probably have time for one more call \u2013 one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question then will come from Adrien de Saint Hilaire from BoA. Please go ahead. One moment, please go ahead.","Adrien de Saint Hilaire","I\u2019ll try to be quick. I\u2019ll try and be quick. Thank you very much. So first of all on the Chinese points, you said it was down mid-single-digits. I\u2019m just curious if you have any explanation why it is indeed down mid-single-digits in an economy which is still growing 5% to 6%. Second question is on your expectations around the phasing out of cookies at Google. Do you think that\u2019s bad news in the short-term, good news in the long-run, or maybe the other way around or is that good news in all cases?","And then, lastly, about your performance in the Middle East, should we expect some carry over into the first half of 2020 as well? Thank you very much.","Philip Angelastro","I\u2019ll take the China question. I think \u2013 our growth this year in China was largely due to some performance challenges. I think we lost a couple of clients. And frankly, as a portfolio, our agencies, with some exceptions, but our agencies didn\u2019t perform as well as they did the year before frankly.","I think the current situation presents a very different set of challenges. So until we get some more clarity and so the situation resolves itself, I think our expectations are similar to everybody else is there is just little bit too much uncertainty to have a clear picture as to how it\u2019s going to roll out in China.","And in the Middle East, I think we\u2019ve got some good businesses that we expect to continue to grow. But as an overall percentage of Omnicom\u2019s portfolio and Omnicom\u2019s growth, we don\u2019t expect that to be significant or meaningful. But it\u2019s been a nice part of our portfolio and we\u2019ve got some nice businesses over there that have been doing well and we certainly expect them to continue to do well.","John Wren","With respect to your first question regarding cookies, honestly, we\u2019ve been expecting this for some time now. It\u2019s not new news to us. It will make targeting a little bit more challenging than it was in the past. Then it certainly will make Google stronger. But in anticipation of it, that\u2019s why we work so diligently on the creation of Omni and the enhancements that we made to it.","In the future, it\u2019s not just going to be the data, it also has a lot to do with the execution, which you actually do with that data and how you process it. Clients, other people have other sources, which we can get access to from first-party data, which can be used to accomplish many of the objectives that were made a little bit easier with cookies.","Adrien de Saint Hilaire","So you don\u2019t expect any impact on your media activities, just to be clear from that news?","John Wren","Very minor. But I expect, because we\u2019ve been adjusting and we\u2019ve been anticipating this for some period of time. There will be changes to everything. What happens today will be different to what happens tomorrow. But we\u2019re not threatened by it. And it makes us more valuable.","Philip Angelastro","Yeah, the more complexity there is in the marketplace, the more clients need our expertise and need us to help them solve some of the challenges that this creates for them, not just for us.","Adrien de Saint Hilaire","Many thanks.","John Wren","Good.","Philip Angelastro","Okay. Thank you everybody for taking the call and for joining us. And have a good rest of the day.","John Wren","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to introduce you to your host for today's conference, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Shub Mukherjee. Please go ahead.","Shub Mukherjee","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our first quarter 2018 earnings call. On the call with me today is John Wren, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer.","We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release we have posted to www.omnicomgroup.com this morning's press release along with the presentation covering the information that we will review this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our Web site.","Before we start, I've been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation, and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and that these statements are our present expectation and that actual events or results may differ materially.","I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.","We are going to begin this morning's call with an overview of our business from John Wren. Then, Phil Angelastro will review our financial results for the quarter and then we will open up the line for your questions.","John Wren","Thank you, Shub. Good morning. I\u2019m pleased to speak to you this morning about our first quarter 2018 results. It\u2019s been about 60 days since our last earnings call and I\u2019m pleased to report a lot has happened in that time, including some big wins for Omnicom.","Before I get into the results, I should note that on January 1, 2018, we adopted a new accounting standard ASC 606. The impact of the required changes were not significant to our results. Phil will cover this change in more detail during his remarks.","Financially, the year has started off in the range we expected with organic growth in the first quarter of 2.4%. First quarter EBITA margin was 12.4% was flat versus the prior year period and EPS for the quarter was up 11.8% to $1.14 per share.","These results serve as a continued commitment to the consistency and diversity of our operations, our strong competitive position across advertising and marketing disciplines in key geographic markets, our market leading digital data and analytical expertise and our ability to provide customer-centric solutions for our clients.","Looking now at our first quarter organic growth across geographies and disciplines, overall, North America revenue was flat. Growth in the U.S. was offset by weak performance in Canada due to primarily the loss of the significant client in that market and due to the shift of some client work from Toronto to New York. To a lesser extent, North America was also impacted by the revenue decline in Puerto Rico.","CRM in North America was up middle single digits across both CRM consumer experience and CRM execution and support services. Healthcare was positive in the low single digits and PR was flat in the quarter. These increases were offset by declines in North America advertising and media for the quarter.","Several of our U.S. ad agencies experienced client losses early in 2017, and we are still cycling through. In addition, while PHD and Hearts & Science continued their strong performance in both the U.S. and globally, OMD continues to cycle through client losses in 2017 and Annalect continues to see the transition of some clients from our performance-based bundled solution to a more traditional agency pass-through offering.","Globally, all of our disciplines had positive growth in Q1 including advertising and media as the international markets performed well across all major regions. After experiencing a decline in Q4, the UK bounced back nicely and was up 3.1% in the first quarter. Advertising and media, PR and healthcare all performed well in the UK. This growth was offset by declines in CRM execution and support services due to weaknesses in field marketing and research.","Overall, growth in Euro and non-Euro regions were very strong at 9.7%. Euro markets were up middle single digits driven by France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Italy and Spain. Germany was the only significant exception to positive growth. Non-Euro markets overall were up double digits led by Russia, the Czech Republic and Sweden.","Asia Pacific first quarter organic growth was also solid at 7.3% as Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore performed well in the quarter. Latin America increased 3.1% for the quarter as Colombia and Mexico offset the continued negative performance in Brazil. We did see significant sequential improvement in Brazil as compared to Q4. However, it\u2019s too early to tell if this trend will continue for the remainder of 2018.","Our smallest region, the Middle East and Africa, had very weak performance for the quarter with a decline of 8.5%. Most of the decline was the result of reductions in media spend in our operations in the UAE.","In the first quarter of 2018, we generated $375 million in free cash flow and returned 368 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Looking forward, our practice of use of free cash flow, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases remains unchanged as does our commitment to having a strong balance sheet and maintaining our investment grade rating.","Before I cover some of the changes occurring in our industry and business, I\u2019d like to address a few corporate governance changes we recently made and which were disclosed in our proxy. In 2015, we undertook a Board refreshment initiative that led to a number of meaningful steps including expanding the responsibilities of our lead Independent Director, adopting a mandatory retirement age for Board members, and bringing greater diversity into the Board and committee leadership.","Most recently, we welcomed Ronnie Hawkins, our newest Independent Director. He is currently Managing Director and Head of International Investments at EIG Global Energy Group. Throughout his career, Ronnie has had broad experiences spanning positions at GE, Citigroup, and Credit Suisse. We are delighted he has agreed to join our Board.","Following our May shareholder meeting, Bruce Crawford will step down as Chairman. Bruce has been a remarkable leader within Omnicom starting his long career at BBDO in 1977 taking over as President and CEO of Omnicom in 1989 and then transitioning to the role of Chairman in 1997. I would like to extend my deep gratitude to Bruce for his wisdom, guidance and numerous contributions to the Board of Directors and to me personally over the past two decades.","In addition, long-serving Board members Jack Purcell and Reg Murphy will also be stepping down from the Board in May. We would like to recognize both Jack and Reg and extend our thanks for their outstanding leadership and dedication and loyalty to Omnicom over the years.","Following these changes and the anticipated approval of our shareholders at our annual shareholders\u2019 meeting on May 22nd, Omnicom\u2019s Board will have 10 independent members including six women and four African-Americans. In addition, female directors chair both the audit and compensation committees, and the majority of our audit, compensation, and governance committees are comprised of female directors. These changes strengthen Omnicom\u2019s governance structure and demonstrate our commitment to on-boarding exceptional candidates who bring a wealth of experience and diverse points of view.","Let me now discuss what we\u2019ve been seeing in the industry and how our strategy has enabled us to achieve consistent financial results. In terms of market trends, we continue to see market as rapidly adjusting their businesses, keep pace with technological disruption, new competitors and evolving consumer behaviors. Today our clients more than ever before need a valued partner to help solve business problems and grow through the lens of marketing.","As market has tackled these challenges, they are transforming their companies with ever increasing focus on placing their customers at the center of their strategies to drive growth. In this environment of the empowered consumer, the root of all transformation is about helping clients build individual relationships with their customers and exceeding customer expectations through compelling experiences.","This means that communications need to be designed around how individuals seek out products and information and experiences need to be tailored in a highly personalized targeted way that can be executed at scale. For this reason, Omnicom has been increasing our internal investments on data, analytics and precision marketing.","Today, our clients expect us to have engaging creative supported by precision media buying fueled by data and technology. Quite frankly being able to deliver the right message to the right person in the right context on the right platform is becoming table stakes in our industry.","Unlike consulting firms or even our peers, Omnicom\u2019s intellectual property or IP is our ability to bring deep consumer insights to our clients in lockstep with bringing creative ideas. As the world of media gets more fragmented, the premium on big creative ideas has never been greater.","We believe it is not enough to target individuals with more preciseness induced at the right time and the right place, to us it is equally important to have effective creative content in those messages. This is why Omnicom has always stayed true to its roots of developing the best creative minds in our industry.","While some of our competitors are pursuing data and analytical solutions to compete with consultants and tech firms, we are taking data and analytics and marrying it to expanse of capabilities we have in our creative, PR, shopper, CRM, healthcare and experiential agencies to deliver one-to-one consumer marketing at scale.","These investments are paying dividends for us and we are continuing to expand our capabilities to meet the changes in the marketplace. The focus of our investments is simple; to help our clients achieve their strategies to transform their businesses to be more consumer-centric and deliver faster growth.","In the past few weeks we have further invested in several key new hires with experience in transformation and ecommerce and you\u2019ll be hearing more from us on these investments and strategies over the coming weeks and months. We are investing in people because clients want access to top talent no matter what agency they sit in or where they are located.","We have simplified our organizational structure and service offering to ensure that our client teams consist of the very best talent in a nimble and flexible fashion. With strong leadership from each of our practice areas, we can better collaborate and execute growth strategies across our key client matrix organization, strengthen our new business development efforts, share experience and knowledge, target our internal investments and create more career opportunities for our people.","We started the formation of specialized groups in 2016 offering our clients a single point of access to our network of thousands of industry specialists in specific marketing disciplines. We now have practice areas in precision marketing and CRM, healthcare, PR, national brand advertising agencies and our global advertising agency networks.","Data and analytics and media platforms like Annalect are being used to inform creative insights across almost all of our businesses. Recently, we announced the Specialty Marketing Group practice area under the leadership of Stacey Hightower. This new practice area combines our portfolio of industry leading companies in field marketing, sales support, merchandizing and point of sale, and consulting for not-for-profit organizations as well as other custom communication services.","The new group addresses both the growing demand for highly specialized marketing services and the need to integrate those services seamlessly into clients marketing efforts across disciplines and around the world. And we\u2019re happy to have Stacey who has led many of these initiatives for Omnicom at the helm.","I\u2019m pleased to report we\u2019re seeing clear benefits from these established practice areas. As an example, in the first quarter, Omnicom Health Group agencies Entr\u00e9e Health and Adelphi collaborated on a new offering around health economics and outcomes research. This is a rising area of investment for clients whose patient outcomes become more closely tied to our products and services are reimbursed.","In looking at other practice areas, the precision marketing group continues to aggressively evolve its precision platform and is closely integrating with both Annalect and Omnicom media group services and systems. This is a unique integrated model at the heart of the new contract awarded by the BBC in the UK.","We are also in the process of following two other practice areas for brand consulting as well as experiential and events. And we will be enhancing our capabilities of our shopper marketing services by establishing a joint technology investment strategy that can provide best-in-class data and analytic platforms and solutions focused on how to better connect shoppers to brands.","Turning now to new business, Amgen selected Hearts & Science as its new consumer media agency after competitive review. It\u2019s important to note that two Omnicom Health Group agencies played an integral role in the win. Our agency BioPharm Communications worked closely with SSCG which retained media duties for Amgen brands marketed to healthcare professionals throughout the pitch. This is an example of growing our business with an existing client by collaborating across the group.","In terms of other recent wins, we are exceptionally pleased that BMW choose Goodby Silverstein & Partners as its lead creative agency in the U.S. following a competitive review. In announcing the win, BMW recognized Goodby\u2019s outstanding creative and their ability to reach millions of consumers with the feeling of speaking only to you. This is a sentiment that reinforces the importance of one-to-one consumer marketing at scale.","Long-time client Johnson & Johnson recently asked our agencies to provide integrated solutions that will help them grow their market share. We formed a dedicated agency called Velocity OMC which consists of talent from BBDO, DDB, Roberts & Langer, CDM and our public relations group. We are very proud of this winning team and happy to be supporting numerous consumer brands for J&J across multiple and highly coordinated disciplines.","In addition to these wins we continue to expand our global footprint and service offerings. On the acquisition front, Omnicom Health Group reached an agreement to acquire the Pharma Communications business in Japan of Elsevier. The newly named agency will be called EMC. With EMC, Omnicom Health Group expands its unmatched capabilities and depth and breadth of dedicated healthcare communication services in Japan which is the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world.","In Germany, Omnicom media group acquired Brain Group, a digitally-focused agency for media planning, marketing and transformation consulting and content creation. On the topic of winning, let me just mention a few of the recent highlights of our agencies being recognized around the globe.","Margaret Johnson, Chief Creative Officer and Partner of Goodby Silverstein was named Ad Age Executive of the Year. Last year, Wendy Clark of DDB won. So it\u2019s nice to have two senior women from Omnicom win this honor back-to-back. BBDO topped the Gunn Report as the world\u2019s most creative agency network for the 12th year in a row. Omnicom was ranked the top holding company.","In the WARC 100 rankings, BBDO was named the most effective and strategic agency network in the world for the fifth consecutive year. TBWA was named Dubai\u2019s Lynx Network of the Year. Our investment in talent, technology and partnerships are making the difference for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these areas as the marketing environment increases in complexity.","In closing, we\u2019re pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter. While it\u2019s early in the year, we\u2019re on track and we are cautiously optimistic that the back half of the year will be stronger than the first half.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at first quarter results. Phil?","Philip Angelastro","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, our results for the first quarter of 2018 were in line with our expectations. Our agencies continue to meet our clients\u2019 needs while operating in an ever changing marketing landscape.","As summarized on Slide 3, our reported revenue for Q1 grew by 1.2% to $3.6 billion. The components of that growth included organic revenue growth which was 2.4% in the quarter which fell within the range of our expectations for organic growth of 2% to 3% for the full year.","With regard to FX, due to the general weakening of the U.S. dollar over the past year, the impact of changes in currency rates increased reported revenue by $151 million or 4.2%. Dispositions continued to exceed revenue from acquisitions in the quarter as we come close to cycling through the disposal of Novus, our print media business which we sold early in the second quarter of 2017.","Acquisition revenue partially offset the disposition impact, including revenue from recent additions of Snow Companies in the U.S. and Brain Group in Germany. The net impact reduced our first quarter revenue by $153 million or about 4.2%.","And lastly, as you are aware, we\u2019re required to adopt FASB new revenue recognition standard known as ASC 606 effective at the beginning of this year. The impact of applying the revenue recognition standard reduced our reported revenue by approximately $42.5 million or 1.2% for the quarter. Later in my remarks I will discuss in more detail the drivers of the changes in revenue, including the expected impact of the new accounting standard going forward.","Turning to Slide 1 on the income statement items below revenue, operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased to 422 million or 1.4% with operating margin of 11.6% unchanged versus Q1 of last year. Our Q1 EBITDA increased to 449 million or about 1% and the resulting EBITDA margin of 12.4% also was level with Q1 of last year.","There are a few items to note regarding margins. ASC 606 did have a minor impact on our operating profit due to a change in the timing of recognition of some of our incentive compensation from our clients. Had we followed the same revenue recognition rules as last year, our EBIT would have been approximately $6.5 million higher in Q1. However, because this change is principally timing related, we expect the net impact for the year to also be minor and less than the Q1 impact overall.","In addition to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, on January 1st, we adopted ASU 2017-07 which requires that we reclassify a portion of our pension and post-employment expense primarily the interest-related components from salary and service costs to the lower operating income as part of interest expense.","A new accounting presentation requires us to restate the prior periods so they are comparable. The amount re-classed for both Q1 of 2018 and Q1 of 2017 was approximately $6 million. The new standard does not have an impact on pre-tax profit or net income.","We\u2019ll continue to pursue our ongoing companywide internal initiatives to increase efficiencies, particularly in our back office operations while balancing the need for continued investments in our businesses to pursue sustained growth in the future.","Additionally, given the vast majority of our expenses were denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, the impact of changes in FX rates on our Q1 operating margin was negligible.","Net interest expense for the quarter was 46.9 million, down 3.1 million versus the 50 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and up 1.5 million versus Q1 of 2017. As previously discussed, in 2018 we adopted ASU 2017-07 and as a result a portion of our pension and post-employment expense has been included in net interest expense and the prior year has been restated to be consistent with the current year\u2019s presentation. Run rate for these expenses in 2017 and 2018 was approximately $6 million per quarter.","Gross interest expense in the first quarter was up about $0.5 million compared to the fourth quarter and interest income was up about $3.5 million also when compared to Q4. Gross interest expense increased by approximately $3 million compared to Q1 of 2017 primarily due to a reduction in the benefits from our interest rate swaps. And interest income increased by approximately 1.5 million.","Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 24.3% down from 29.2% last year. The primary driver of the lower effective rate was the lower U.S. tax rate as a result of the 2017 Tax Act which reduced the federal statutory tax rate to 21%. Tax Act also imposes a minimum tax on foreign earnings, partially offsetting the benefit to our effective tax rate from the lowest statutory rate.","For the full year 2018, we\u2019re anticipating an effective tax rate of 28.1% excluding any potential tax benefit from our share-based compensation which is difficult to estimate because it is subject to changes in our stock price and the impact of any future stock option exercises.","This would be a reduction of over 4% versus our normalized rate of approximately 32.4% in 2017 which excludes the incremental tax charge that was incurred in Q4 of 2017 in connection with the Tax Act and also excludes the impact of the tax benefits realized in 2017 related to share-based compensation. Q1 rate is lower than our anticipated rate of 28.1% by approximately $13 million primarily as a result of the successful resolution of foreign tax claims in the quarter.","Earnings from our affiliates totaled $800,000 for the quarter, up versus $100,000 last year and the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries was flat with last year at $20.6 million. As a result, net income for the first quarter increased 9.2% to $264 million.","Now turning to Slide 2. Income available for common shareholders for the quarter was 264 million and our diluted share count for the quarter decreased 2.1% versus Q1 of last year to 231.5 million. As a result, our diluted EPS for the first quarter was $1.14, up $0.12 a share or 11.8%.","Turning back to Slide 3 which details our revenue performance, let me start the discussion by reviewing the impact of ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard. In summary, after a detailed review the impact of standard would have on our businesses including detailed reviews of our client compensation agreements, we determined that as we expected the new standard does not have a material impact on our revenue or operating results.","Consistent with the disclosure in our 2017 annual report, the new standard does not materially impact method or the timing of when we will recognize revenue under majority of our client arrangements, including our fixed fee retainer based or commission based client arrangements.","New standard impacted the timing of the recognition of certain performance incentive provisions that are included in our client agreements. The achievement of certain qualitative or quantitative objectives can result in incremental compensation or revenue for the services we deliver.","Previously, performance incentives were recognized as revenue when our performance against qualitative goals was acknowledged by the client or when specific quantitative goals were achieved. This often occurred on a lag resulting in recognition of these incentives late in the year or early in the subsequent year.","The new standard requires these items to be estimated and included in the total consideration in the year the services are performed and to be evaluated throughout the contract period. Additionally, a new standard resulted in a reduction of revenue and operating expense in Q1 of '18 of approximately $30 million in one of our CRM consumer experience agencies.","Because the impact of 606 was not material to our results, we adopted a new standard by the modified retrospective method of adoption. Under this method, 2017 results were not restated. Accordingly, for comparability purposes, on Slide 17 we present revenue for Q1 2018 as if we followed the previous standard, ASC 605, and we applied our previous revenue recognition policy.","As I mentioned, we estimate the impact of applying the new revenue recognition standard, reduced our reported revenue in the first quarter of 2018 by approximately 42.5 million or 1.2% and the impact on EBIT and our results from operations as well as the balance sheet and cash flow were not material. This reduction in revenue is roughly in line with the anticipated impact we expect to see for the remainder of the quarters in 2018 or a reduction in revenue of approximately 150 million for the full year.","And as previously discussed, had we followed the same revenue recognition rules as last year, our EBIT in Q1 2018 would have been approximately $6.5 million higher. However, because the impact on EBIT is principally timing related, we expect the net impact for the year to be minor. As we go forward, the impact on our quarterly reported numbers will ultimately be based on the specific mix of business in that particular quarter.","Turning to FX. During the first quarter, the U.S. dollar continued to weaken year-over-year against almost all of the foreign currencies we operate in. As a result, the impact of changes in currency rates increased reported revenue by 4.2% or $151 million in revenue for the quarter.","A major driver of our FX movement continues to be the euro which accounted for nearly half of the increase in revenue due to changes in FX during the quarter. Additionally, the dollar weakened against the UK pound, the Australian dollar, the Chinese renminbi and the Canadian dollar.","Also in the first quarter, the dollar strengthened against the Brazilian real only slightly offsetting the increase in revenue due to FX. Obviously making an assumption on how foreign currency rates will move over the next few months let alone the balance of 2018 is speculative. But looking forward if currencies stay where they currently are, FX could have a positive impact on our revenues of approximately 3% during the second quarter and approximately 2.5% for the full year.","The impact of our recent acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by $153 million in the quarter or 4.2%. Dispositions continued to exceed revenue from acquisitions in the quarter as we come close to cycling through the disposal of Novus, our print media business which we sold early in the second quarter of 2017. So while there will be a modest effect in the second quarter, Q1 represents the last quarter that our revenue will be significantly impacted by that divestiture.","Based on transactions we\u2019ve completed to date and since we will cycle through the Novus disposition early in Q2, our current expectations are that the impact of our acquisition activity net of dispositions will reduce revenue by about 1% in the second quarter of 2018 and then range between flat and positive 1% for the remainder of 2018.","As we\u2019ve done in the past, we will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that enhance our service offerings and make internal investments in our agencies that are consistent with our strategic plan. And we will also continue to evaluate our current portfolio of businesses in the context of our strategic priority.","And finally, organic growth was positive on a global basis for the quarter, up $87 million or 2.4% for the first quarter. Each of our five disciplines were up organically for the quarter in total. The performance within disciplines remains mixed by agency.","Geographically, our European and Asian regions led the way. UK returned to positive organic growth and the U.S. was marginally positive. However, weakness in Canada resulted in North America being slightly negative for the quarter.","Slide 4 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the first quarter, the split was 52% for advertising and 48% for marketing and services. As for their organic growth by discipline, our advertising discipline was up 1.6%. Advertising organic growth continued to be led by our media businesses with the strong performance by Hearts & Science and PHD offsetting challenges still faced by OMD, while our global and national advertising agencies saw mixed results this quarter.","CRM consumer experience was up 6.9% for the quarter, primarily on the strength of our events business domestically and in Asia. A portion of the increased activity in events can be attributed to the Winter Olympics in February.","Results for the rest of the discipline was mixed. Shopper marketing was up while direct digital marketing and branding were marginally negative. CRM execution and support was up 1.2% in the quarter. Our field marketing, not-for-profit and merchandizing and point of sale businesses were all positive for the quarter, which were offset by declines in research and specialty production.","PR was up seven-tenths of a point. Performance in the discipline was mixed by geographic region. The UK led the way while North America and Continental Europe were both essentially flat with Asia and Latin America both slightly down in the quarter. And healthcare was up 2.7%, a nice recovery after a negative performance in the fourth quarter. Performance was balanced with positive growth across all regions.","As a reminder, in Q4 2017, we revised the detail we provided regarding our marketing services agencies to reflect the realignment of our disciplines to better capture the expanded scope of our services. As a result of this realignment, our CRM discipline has been disaggregated into two separate categories.","CRM consumer experience which includes direct and digital marketing agencies and Omnicom precision marketing group as well as our consulting and branding agencies, shopper marketing agencies and our experiential marketing agencies and CRM execution and support which includes our field marketing, sales support, merchandizing and point of sale as well as other specialized marketing and custom communication agencies. We also realigned and renamed our specialty communications discipline so that it now exclusively includes agencies offering healthcare marketing and communication services.","On Slide 24, we have provided the 2017 quarterly historical data that reflects the realignment of the discipline. On Slide 5 which details the regional mix of business, you can see during the quarter the split was 55% for North America, 10% for the UK, 20% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, 3% for Latin America and the remainder in Middle East and Africa markets.","Turning to the details of our performance by region, organic revenue growth in North America was down marginally at one-tenth of a percent. Marginally positive performance from our U.S. business was offset by a decrease in Canada. While in the region, we saw positive performance from our events businesses as well as PR and healthcare agencies. The advertising and media agencies in the region continued their softness.","The UK was up 3% after a down fourth quarter. Results of this quarter were solid across most of our disciplines with advertising, media, healthcare and PR more than offsetting decreases in our field marketing and research businesses. The rest of Europe was up 9.7% organically in the quarter. Within the Eurozone we had growth in all of our disciplines. By country, Spain once again led the way but we also saw strong performance in the Netherlands and France. Additionally, Belgium and Italy performed well while Germany lagged behind.","Growth in Europe outside the Eurozone continued to be positive as well. The Asia Pacific region was up 7.3% and we continue to see organic growth across our major markets in the region, including Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore as well as Greater China. Latin America had organic growth of 3% in the first quarter.","Brazil was negative but at a lower level than we saw in the past few quarters. While there are some preliminary positive signs regarding the local economy, the ongoing political climate in Brazil makes it difficult to be confident that they are entering a sustained period of stability.","Elsewhere in the region, Colombia had a strong quarter while our agencies in Mexico continued to perform well. In the Middle East and Africa, which is our smallest region, was down due to decreased media activity by our clients in the region and nonrecurring projects, primarily in the UAE.","Turning to Slide 6. We present our mix of business by industry sector. Comparing the first quarter revenue for 2018 to 2017, the mix is fairly steady. Now turning to our cash flow performance. On Slide 7, you can see that in the first quarter we generated $375 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, which represents an increase of about $20 million over the first three months of 2017.","As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 8, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $139 million, reflective of the 5% per share increase in the quarterly dividend that was approved last October which was partially offset by the reduction in our outstanding common shares due to repurchase activity over the past year.","Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders totaled $16 million while capital expenditures were 36 million. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled just under $200 million and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled 229 million and was similar to what we repurchased during the first three months of the last year. All-in, we have spent our free cash flow by about 245 million in the first quarter.","Turning to Slide 9. Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt is $4.9 billion. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.3 billion, up nearly 1.2 billion compared to year-end December 31, 2017. The increase in net debt was a result of the typical uses of working capital that historically occur on our first quarter and the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $245 million.","These increases in net debt were partially offset by the effect of exchange rates on cash during Q1 but increased our cash balance by about $30 million. Compared to this time last year, our net debt is down $133 million. The decrease is primarily the result of generating approximately $80 million in net free cash flow over the past 12 months and the effect of exchange rates on cash that increased our cash balance by about 190 million. These reductions are partially offset by the changes in operating capital which negatively impacted our cash by approximately 100 million over the past 12 months.","Our working capital was also negatively impacted this quarter as a result of the acceleration of the payment of certain bonuses in the U.S. to take advantage of the change in tax rates. Comparable bonus payments were made in Q2 of last year, so this was a timing item between Q1 and Q2. The net effect of these items was a reduction in working capital of approximately 275 million compared to Q1 of 2017.","As for our debt ratios, they remain solid. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.1x and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1x. And due to the year-over-year increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio decreased to 10.4x but remains quite strong.","Turning to Slide 10. We continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well focused internal development initiatives and prudently price acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio 21.3% while our return on equities 46.7%. Both are down year-over-year due to the additional tax charge we took in Q4 in connection with the passage of the Tax Act. That impact should be more than offset by the positive impact the lower tax rate will have on our results going forward.","And finally on Slide 11, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10 plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2018 to March 31st of 2018 which totaled 10.3 billion. And the bar show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders including both dividend and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period 10.9 billion resulting in a cumulative payout ratio 106% over the last decade.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we\u2019ve included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we\u2019re going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is going to come from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much. And thanks for the color on growth by region. But I was hoping if you can kind of take a step back and sort of maybe more broadly generalize. You\u2019ve seen kind of underperformance or relative to underperformance in the U.S. now for quite some time and this outperformance globally, internationally. I guess if you were to say there were a few reasons or a reason that really is sort of responsible for that disconnect in growth I guess how would you generalize that? And then I just have a follow-up question really on account losses. It sounds like you\u2019re still seeing some headwinds from OMD impact in 2018 from losses there. I guess any more color when we can circle those, we might see more favorable comparisons? Thank you.","John Wren","Sure. This is John. Alexia, good morning.","Alexia Quadrani","Good morning.","John Wren","When you take a look at our geography, $8.5 billion, $8.8 billion of our revenue is generated in the United States, and so it is a big number. And before you start any kind of division or a subtraction or addition, where some of our largest accounts not the biggest accounts we have but $10 million, $20 million accounts is where we suffered losses as we suggested in our comments in the beginning part of the last year. So that\u2019s one of the reasons. So that constrains our overall growth and it has for three quarters of last year and will probably for the first and possibly the second quarter of this year before we cycle fully through those losses and offset it by gains. Now there is a lot of activity going on in the marketplace and we\u2019ve won quite a number of pieces of that business and a significant portion of them are based in the United States, but we won\u2019t start to \u2013 because of the 60, 90-day clauses that our competitors had in those contracts, we won\u2019t see the addition of that revenue until later on in the year. So that\u2019s the primary reason for it. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re underperforming. We\u2019re not. We know full well what and why we\u2019re performing at the level we are and where we\u2019ve had to make management changes because we weren\u2019t getting the kind of level of activity that we wanted, we\u2019ve made those changes. It takes a while for those people to make a contribution. So there\u2019s a lot of activity underlying the numbers but you have to look at the sheer size of the United States to our portfolio in order to fully sort of understand why you\u2019re not getting a similar growth in smaller markets, you know $10 million or $20 million account win and add from a percentage point of view a much larger percentage.","Alexia Quadrani","That\u2019s very helpful. And then if I could just ask a follow up on the account movement that you sort of highlighted. When you look at sort of where you are in the industry today, maybe versus 10, 15, 20 years ago, do you find that the client conflict issues are less of a constraint and there does seem to be a lot of accounts in review right now, and like you\u2019ve highlighted you\u2019ve won a fair share of them. Are you more -- is there more flexibility to kind of pitch or win business because client conflict is less of an issue or is that not necessarily the case?","John Wren","If I had to make a generalization, I\u2019d say client conflict is less of an issue, far less of an issue. Quite a number of our clients are prospective clients and RFPs that come in really wanting Omnicom solutions. They\u2019re no longer simply looking for a particular brand or particular aspect of our business. And that allows us to create different types of business models and ring-fence them in such a way that conflicts are not what they once were when we were smaller.","Alexia Quadrani","All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Craig Huber","Hi. Thank you. Every quarter, you generally give us the net new billing wins or losses. You generally target about $1 billion each quarter. What was it for the first quarter please?","Philip Angelastro","It was probably in the neighborhood of 1 billion to 1.25 billion.","Craig Huber","Okay. Thank you for that. Can you give us a little more detail on your expectations when you think the OMD agency may start to see some better numbers? Are you hopeful for the second half of the year or we should be thinking more like 2019?","John Wren","Well, assuming everything stays at a steady state and we fully expect it to, in terms of wins, losses, opportunities, we should start to see improvement in the latter part of the year and certainly 2019. We made a complete change of top management both globally and in the United States about two quarters ago, and as I said it takes some time and it takes opportunities that are provided by clients -- then we have to win them. But we should have cycled through whatever losses we had and then I\u2019m expecting positive growth. The other thing which becomes a smaller problem each particular quarter is the \u2013this isn\u2019t just OMD, this is in the media group is programmatic in the way we do it. A lot of our clients over the course of the last five quarters have shifted \u2013 especially in the United States have shifted from a bundled way of purchasing to an unbundled methodology of purchasing. It doesn\u2019t necessarily change our profitability or the number of accounts or the number of people that we serve. As a matter of fact, we\u2019re growing in that area. What it does do is it has an impact on the reported revenue. So that also has an impact which if somebody\u2019s just focused on top line, it\u2019s \u201cOh my God.\u201d If somebody\u2019s focused on the substance and the profitability of the business, it\u2019s actually a growing area.","Craig Huber","And then John my other big picture question here is when you\u2019re talking about 2% to 3% organic growth for this year, historically the economic environment like this you and your peers might be growing solid mid single digits in line with global nominal GDP if not 100 basis points faster. In your mind \u2013 I don\u2019t want to take a lot of your time but can you just give us like four or five bullets of the reasons in your mind of why your growth and your peers in the worst slower growth I\u2019m saying \u2013 four or five bullets of reasons of why you think your growth is not middle single digits right now versus historically \u2013 normally would be in this sort of economic environment?","John Wren","Well, one of the reasons for our guidance is there\u2019s \u2013 you won\u2019t see it as much in numbers simply we reported but I suspect you\u2019re going to start to see some weird aberrations as a competitor\u2019s report. There was a significant change in accounting and couldn\u2019t affect our numbers very much. But based on some of the signals that our competitors have laid out I do believe that you\u2019re going to see a great deal of confusion out there for the next couple of quarters. You won\u2019t see that confusion in Omnicom but you\u2019ll see it in other places. Clients are under different amounts of pressure. You see it in what they report. The world is changing and changing rapidly and what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re trying to grow our base, we\u2019re trying to make investments and often times those are internal investments. We set up as we always have for consistent growth going forward. That means there\u2019s a change in the way that we service clients and everybody in the world is trying in a 2% growth, 3% growth world is focusing on efficiency among first and foremost. And so things that were done in the past which were nice to have are no longer done. Things are being done differently because of changes in technology and the impact that that has. There is no one big single item that\u2019s occurring. But we\u2019re rebuilding the airplane that\u2019s flying it 560 miles an hour at 39,000 feet as we speak. I think we\u2019ve done a pretty successful job at it and will continue to do that. But there\u2019s an awful lot of changes to the component parts of how we\u2019re servicing our clients.","Philip Angelastro","And our agencies are certainly focused on our clients\u2019 customer and the consumer primarily and there\u2019s an awful lot of change that\u2019s been occurring especially rather rapidly in terms of consumer behavior. And our clients work with us on a daily basis on trying to come up with new ways and strategies for how to reach that consumer in this rapidly changing technological environment and rapidly changing media landscape. So there\u2019s an awful lot more opportunity for our clients to change their approach to how to reach the consumer in the most efficient and effective way and I think some of that change certainly offers opportunities but it also causes clients to think a little bit about where they\u2019re going to invest and how much they\u2019re going to invest in addition to some of the cost pressures they\u2019re facing.","John Wren","One thing I might add to that \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to cut your question \u2013 is the last several years your ability to gather information and create platforms which will allow you to more closely target whoever your consumer is, that has moved very, very rapidly. It\u2019s no longer simply just targeting people of being able to reach them, the devices that they use. Now you have to reach that consumer, engage them in something \u2013 a type of creative that is of interest to them and you have to be able to do that at scale. I think as I said in my prepared remarks, the IP that Omnicom has because being able to do those targeting exercises and everything else really becomes table stakes as we go into the future. But to be able to have a creative engagement that you can do at scale to individuals is what is going to make the difference as the next level of communications.","Craig Huber","My last quick question is if you just thought of your top 25 clients let\u2019s say the last five quarters, is the revenue growth on average with the top 25 clients in line with your corporate average better or worst please? Thank you.","John Wren","I do have those stacked some place. But on average and I haven\u2019t looked at it \u2013 I didn\u2019t look at it in particular this quarter. But I\u2019d say that if you looked at just the top 25, we\u2019ve been expanding those relationships and on average that growth exceeds the overall growth of the report as a company.","Craig Huber","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of John Janedis from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis","Hi. Thanks. John, maybe two follow ups of sorts. First, you talked about the leadership and investment in talent. Are there any examples of traction you\u2019re seeing at the precision marketing group now they\u2019re about six or seven months into that leadership change? And then separately, can you give a little bit more color around your comment around the shape of organic this year, meaning the better second half potentially? Are clients suggesting a pickup in spend? Is the benefit from leadership changes or account wins and losses or a combination or things? Thanks.","John Wren","We\u2019ve been rebuilding the team at our precision marketing group and we\u2019ve hired quite a number of very talented people. We\u2019re integrating the platforms that we\u2019re utilizing to deliver our products into the Annalect platforms and expanding that. And quite a bit of work has already been accomplished but I\u2019d have to say we still have a little bit more to do before we\u2019ll be fully satisfied with what we have. I have rather extensive meetings backend of next week to get a complete up-to-date status on exactly where we are but I\u2019m very comfortable with the progress we have made. Like everything else, I wish we were done. We\u2019re not but we\u2019re very, very close. And then it\u2019s just a process of selling that into the marketplace. So that\u2019s an area of expected growth not maybe for the next quarter but certainly as I look out into the backend of the year and in 2019. But there\u2019s a lot of upside there for us that we haven\u2019t yet taken advantage of. And I took so long to answer that question; I forgot the other part of your question.","John Janedis","Just a little more color maybe on the shape of organic this year, meaning the back half improvement, is it client suggesting a pickup in spend, is it leadership change, account wins, losses or a combination?","John Wren","I think it\u2019s a combination to be perfectly honest with you. My confidence comes from specifics that have happened within Omnicom, wins that I know we have coming onboard and what\u2019s happening to our individual business. So that\u2019s where my confidence is coming from. I also expect that consumers probably see increasingly get comfortable with the additional cash that they have in their pockets which they probably didn\u2019t see in January and February but started to see after a couple of months of the new tax bill. So I think it\u2019s a combination of events, but my comments were more specifically focused on what\u2019s occurred within the various accounting \u2013 the various groups within Omnicom.","Philip Angelastro","I think just to be clear though, John, we at this point are not changing our view for the year in terms of 2% to 3% as an expectation but we\u2019re certainly optimistic.","John Janedis","Thank you.","John Wren","Cautiously optimistic is a phase I\u2019ve been using for the last several years and I\u2019ll stick with that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Stabler","Thanks very much. A couple for Phil on 606. I realize this is a pretty small amount of money in the big picture but wondering if you could give us a bit of detail. We understand under 505 this would have been classified as organic growth. Can you give us a sense of is this North America primarily this 42 million? Would it have fallen there? And then by discipline roughly where would that have been? And then any sort of forward look on whether you think that impact is going to grow, maintain or moderate going forward? Thank you.","Philip Angelastro","So the majority of the change certainly happened in North America and will roll out for the remainder of the year in North America. The piece of the change that relates to our incentive compensation provisions and our client arrangements, that\u2019s pretty much spread globally and it\u2019s spread consistently throughout the disciplines, more or less. So there\u2019s not a concentration in one place or another. And as far as disciplines, it\u2019s in the CRM consumer experience discipline is where the large part of the change occurred and can be expected to kind of continue to roll out throughout the rest of the year.","Peter Stabler","And in terms of scale, do you expect significantly different scale?","Philip Angelastro","No. In terms of numbers, two things. As far as the change in the revenue number, the numbers by quarter we expect them to be relatively consistent plus or minus a few million here or there. And in total, about 150 million for the year is our estimate. And then as far as the impact on EBIT, ultimately we expect that to just be a timing difference. So by the time you finish the year, you\u2019re only talking about a difference of a couple million bucks probably.","Peter Stabler","Thanks very much.","Philip Angelastro","Sure.","Operator","Thank you.","Philip Angelastro","Now that the market\u2019s open, I think we have time for one last call, operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thanks for squeezing me in. John, I wanted to ask you about the situation over at WPP, there\u2019s been a lot of speculation that assets may come to market for sale. I know that\u2019s probably \u2013 it\u2019s probably very early days there on what they may do next. But just interested in what you think the impact either for your businesses from an account review competition perspective or if they\u2019re assets in research or other analytics that you might be interested in? And then if I could ask Phil to \u2013 you mentioned events and I think Olympics specifically is helping the CRM segment which was your leading segment this quarter. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re willing to quantify sort of the benefit to organic growth from either events or Olympics that you mentioned in your prepared remarks? Thanks.","John Wren","In terms of what\u2019s occurring with our competitor, I don\u2019t know a great deal more than any of you because most of my intelligence is coming from the newspaper reports and the rest of it. In many ways I have a great deal of respect for Martin. I\u2019ve competed against him the last 25 years and very honorably. I know that he was in the process of evaluating his own portfolio. I don\u2019t know what conclusion the new leadership will reach. In terms of Kantor and the other names that are being bantered about, that\u2019s not a key focus for our acquisition. So I would imagine if that\u2019s what they decide to sell \u2013 any one of the number of other buyers including probably private equity. So I can\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not much help when it comes to answering that question directly for you. I\u2019m sorry.","Benjamin Swinburne","That\u2019s okay. Thanks.","Philip Angelastro","And in terms of the events business, I don\u2019t have an Olympics number separately but probably the majority or more than half anyway of the growth in CRM consumer experience is from our events businesses and a variety of things, certainly not Olympics.","Benjamin Swinburne","Phil, can I just ask \u2013 I know we\u2019re running out of time but I think you mentioned 606 had an expense impact in the quarter otherwise maybe you would have had a higher OI. I think that\u2019s how you explained it. That would have been higher. But you also talked about moving I think a similar amount of money in pension expense out of OpEx below the line. So is it sort of a push, is that the conclusion from those comments?","Philip Angelastro","No, those are two separate things. So the pension adjustment we\u2019re required to restate the prior year to show the presentation consistently. So it\u2019s about $6 million in '18 and $6 million in '17 that got re-classed out of our operating expenses below operating income. So that had really no impact other than if you\u2019re calculating a margin percentage on operating income, it went up a little bit each year. So year-on-year no change. And then as far as 606, had we applied the prior year\u2019s revenue recognition accounting 605 we would have recorded about 6 million, 6.5 million more of EBIT just because of the timing of the incentives that we booked consistently over the years. That change requires us to book those incentives differently and that\u2019s the timing difference. That ultimately will lead to maybe a 1 million or 2 million of difference for the full year. It resulted in less EBIT in the first quarter, about 6 million the new way.","Benjamin Swinburne","Got it. Thanks for the clarification.","Philip Angelastro","Sure. Okay. Thank you everybody for joining the call.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

We recognize the global economy is operating in 3 speeds. As the European downturn continues to unfold, it's impact, for now, is limited to Europe. Despite these problems, we continue to see significant opportunities for growth. ","Amidst the uncertainty, we continue to focus on the things we, at Omnicom, can control. First, let me speak about the fourth quarter in 2011. Organic growth in the fourth quarter was up 5.2%. This reflected strong performance even in the face of difficult year-over-year comps. Our fourth quarter was driven by strong results across both disciplines and markets with the notable exception of euro markets, where growth was negative for the quarter. For the full year, organic growth was 6.1%. ","In the quarter, we continue to expand our presence in key emerging markets. We announced the acquisition of a majority stake in the Mudra group, one of India's leading integrated marketing communication companies, and we completed transactions in Turkey and South Africa. These transactions helped us build our capabilities and expand our base of talent in these key markets. ","During 2011, we also accelerated our investments in digital, social, mobile and analytics across the networks. We continue to pursue a multipronged strategy built around the core idea that all of our agencies must have strong digital capabilities to compete in the future. As a result, we are helping in pushing our agencies, where needed, to continue to accelerate the expansion of their digital expertise. We're also consolidating our expertise and knowledge in technology where appropriate. ","Finally, we have acquired new capabilities to complement our existing skill sets. These investments are helping us to deliver innovative and integrated solutions for our clients and to expand our business into new areas. As one example of this integration, I'd like to highlight the Bringing Happiness Home campaign we just did for PepsiCo in China for the Chinese new year. It featured 3 of PepsiCo's strongest brands, Pepsi, Lay's and Tropicana, and was delivered on TV, online, in the store and at a home. Two weeks into the campaign, the results have been outstanding. The 10-minute mini movie at the center of the campaign has become China's #1 online video and has been viewed more than 100 million times. That is what you call earned media.","Our agencies remain focused on delivering value for our clients and in promoting strong cultures built around talented and creative people who help us win in the market every day. You've all heard me say this before, in the battle between culture and strategy, culture eats strategy for breakfast every time. ","Driven by their creative cultures, Omnicom's agencies, together with their clients, were recognized around the world for their work in 2011. While I can't mention all of the awards, I'd like to highlight a few. BBDO and DDB finished #1 and #2 in the Gunn Report's 2011 Most Awarded Agency Networks in the World. It was BBDO's sixth consecutive first-place finish and DDB's third consecutive second-place finish. BBDO was named 2011 Global Agency of the Year by both Adweek and Campaign magazines, and for the fifth year in a row, BBDO topped The Big Won. OMG was named Global Media Agency of the Year by Adweek and Media Agency of the Year by Ad Age. TBWA Hakuhodo was named 2011 International Agency of the Year by Ad Age. Ketchum was awarded the International Consultancy of the Year honor by PRWeek, and LatinWorks was named Ad Agency (sic) [Ad Age] Multicultural Agency of the Year. I want to personally congratulate all of our agencies for their outstanding work in 2011. ","Finally, the strategic review of our portfolio of agencies, together with other steps we took during 2011 to improve our operation, resulted in significant progress towards our margin goal during the year. Randy will provide more detail on the specifics of our performance in the call. However, in 2012, we expect to achieve our goal of restoring margins to the 2007 level.","Now let me highlight a few key areas around our fourth quarter and 2011 performance. By region, across our businesses and geographies, we saw a continued and, often, accelerating growth in the fourth quarter. Randy will take you through the details. Looking at our performance by industry, we continue to experience growth across almost all our segments. Revenue during the quarter was particularly strong in auto, consumer products, financial services and retail while only a couple of areas had negative performance, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and travel and entertainment. For the year, all of our industry groups had positive organic growth. ","On the new business front, we continue to see strong client retention rates, expansion of existing relationships and meaningful new business wins. In the quarter, we generated in excess of $1 billion in net new business, bringing our total for the year to almost $4.5 billion. ","Before turning to 2012, I'd like to point out a few measures that I think captured the value we have created for shareholders. First, our full year 2011 net income increased over 15%, and our EPS increased over 23%. Second, we again generated over $1 billion in free cash flow and, taken together through share buybacks and dividends, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders in 2011. Last week, we also increased our dividend by 20%. Since 2009, we've doubled our dividend per share. And finally, our balance sheet remains extremely strong, providing us the flexibility to pursue attractive investments as they arise.","We believe our results reflect the highly diversified nature of our business by geography, by discipline and by client. All of these attributes allow us to take advantage of opportunities in fast-growing areas while helping us to maintain greater stability in volatile economic environments. As we look to 2012, we remain focused on returning our margins to 2007 levels, and we firmly believe that we will hit our targets. But that's not the end of the story. We'll continue to grow and strengthen our business performance in 2013 and beyond. ","With many of the actions necessary to achieve our margin goal significantly complete, we will turn a greater focus to accelerating growth. As I previously mentioned, I think it is clear to everyone that we are operating in a world with 3 distinct speeds, and our efforts will be focused in the regions and areas where growth opportunities are most attractive.","Our core strategies to achieve growth remain the same. We believe that 2011 was the year in which the historical distinction between so-called traditional and digital media disappeared. As we had always said it would, at least with respect to the services we provide our clients. Everything we do has a digital component to it, and growth of mobile and IPTV is accelerating. As one of our clients put it, we have moved from an era of digital marketing to one of marketing in a digital world. This is a world in which everything is connected and everything's always on. A world where new technologies emerge and disappear on an ever shorter cycle. ","In this world, we believe that our competitive position is advanced by maintaining the flexibility to adapt fast to change by owning only those capabilities that allow us to add greatest value and developing mutually beneficial partnerships with companies and technologies, even those which are not yet proven. Our financial strength and our open-source approach to technology gives us the flexibility we need to succeed and limit the need to protect outdated services and platforms. ","We believe we can add the greatest value to our clients by helping identify and find the most valuable audience segments, understanding their motivation and purchase behaviors and then leveraging our creative strength to deliver compelling experiences to them at the most appropriate moments and in a cost-efficient way. As I mentioned, our focus is not to own data or platforms but on using the best data and platforms intelligently and on leveraging the many partnerships we have with media, technology, data and research companies to ensure we are maintaining access to the latest innovations and information in the marketplace.","We continue to invest in digital capabilities and expert people to build and expand our leadership in emerging service areas, and we are focused on taking advantage of the continued shift to a more interconnected activities by consumers and businesses as they extend further into social and mobile platforms. We believe the world will become increasingly more complex, and our partnership approach versus making bets on specific digital platforms will allow us to adapt our services to new technologies and will help us seamlessly integrate digital within our clients' overall marketing strategies.","In 2012, we also plan to further expand our footprint in developing markets. Over the past few years, the percentage of our business generated from markets other than the U.S., U.K. and euro currency markets has grown significantly and now represents over 22% of our business compared to 16.6% in 2009. Our investments in digital and in developing markets will help us deepen and extend client relationships. Our top priority is to constantly challenge ourselves to add value to our incredible roster of clients.","None of these would be possible without the talented, creative and dedicated people at our agencies around the world. We continue to be a company that believes that culture and challenge are the essential ingredients for success and recognize that by investing in the training, development and retention of our employees, we can drive long-term growth for the company.","Finally, as I look across our agency networks and talk to many of our leaders, I see more and more examples of integration and collaboration that drives client satisfaction. We continue to work to bring the best that we can offer to our clients across our network and to leverage our scale and specialization for their benefit. We expect more of that in 2012.","I'll now turn the call back to Randy who will take you through the numbers.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Thank you, John. Now turning to the details of our financial performance. Revenue for the quarter was up 7.4% to $3.85 billion, again exceeding our expectations due to strong operating performance of many of our agencies. Revenue for the full year came in up 10.6% at $13.87 billion. The strong revenue performance in the quarter, combined with our continuing emphasis on cost control, resulted in EBITA of $511 million, up 11.2%. The EBITA margin for the quarter was on target at 13.3%, which was a year-over-year increase of about 50 basis points. For the full year, EBITA increased 15.1% to $1.76 billion, and our EBITA margin increased 50 basis points to 12.7%. ","We did take a number of cost actions this year including, some 35 dispositions, as well as severance actions, costing more than $200 million. As a result, although not without challenges, we believe we're on track to achieve our previously stated target of 13.4% EBITA margins for full year 2012. ","Net interest expense for the quarter was $30.3 million, down about $1.8 million from Q4 of last year and down about $1.6 million from the third quarter. The decrease versus Q3 was primarily the result of better cash management, resulting in increased interest income earned on our foreign cash balances. For the year, net interest expense was up $12.3 million, primarily related to the full year impact of interests on the 10-year notes we issued in the middle of 2010. That increase was partially offset by increased interest income earned on our cash balances.","On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%, and we expect our operating rate for 2012 to continue to be around 34%. Also worth noting, our income from equity method investments decreased about $3.5 million, and our minority interest increased about $3.3 million in the quarter. While there were a number of individual increases and decreases in these accounts, the primary driver for both numbers was our acquisition in the first quarter of an additional interest in the Clemenger Group, changing it from an affiliate to a consolidated subsidiary with a 26% minority interest. ","As a result of all of that, our net income for the quarter increased a very solid 10.3% to $272 million. And for EPS, the 10.3% increase in net income, combined with a year-over-year share reduction of about 5%, resulted in diluted earnings per share increasing 15.7% to $0.96, we believe, a very solid quarter and a good finish to the year. And with the significant actions taken this year, we believe we're well positioned going into 2012 for another successful year.","On Page 3, we take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX. Over the course of the quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened against many of our major currencies, including the euro and the pound, which, on a year-over-year basis, resulted in FX adding only about $1 million to revenue this quarter. Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are, we expect FX to be negative by about 1.25% in Q1 and about 1.5% for the full year 2012. However, FX rates have been pretty volatile recently. So we can't be certain how much they will change.","Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $80 million in the quarter or about 2.2%. The more significant acquisitions this year include the Clemenger Group and Communispace, which we completed early in the year, and then Mudra, Marina Maher and Medina\/Turgul in Turkey late in the year. And as I mentioned previously, we completed a number of small dispositions during the year, mostly in United States.","With regard to organic growth, we had another very strong quarter, well ahead of expectations, up 5.2% or $185 million. For the full year, organic growth of 6.1% was driven by a combination of factors. First, very strong new business wins; also, a rebound in spending by many clients; continued double-digit growth in the developing markets; and most importantly, our agencies continuing to expand their capabilities and service offerings, utilizing the many new technologies and communication mediums that are being developed in the marketplace.","Turning to our mix of business. Brand advertising accounted for 47.5% of our revenue and marketing and services, 52.5%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising to organic growth was 7.3% while marketing services was up 3.3%. Within the marketing and services area, CRM had 6% organic growth. And within this sector, sales promotion, branding, events and field marketing all had very strong performances in the quarter. Public relations was marginally positive, and specialty communications decreased 5.1%. This was primarily the result of continuing declines in our recruitment marketing business and mixed performance in our healthcare businesses, with generally lower spending by a number of our pharma clients.","On Slide 5, our geographic mix of business in the quarter was split just about 50-50 between the United States and the international markets. In the United States, revenue increased $92 million or 5%. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by $4.5 million, and organic growth continued to be strong at 5.3% even though we cycled on very strong year-over-year comparables. ","International revenue increased $174 million or about 9.9%. As I mentioned, FX was effectively neutral increasing revenue by just under $1 million. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $84.5 million or about 4.8%, and organic growth, our results were mixed by country, overall, increased 5% in the quarter or $88 million.","Specifically in Asia, we had very strong performances in Australia, India, Singapore and China while Japan was flat and Korea was marginally negative. We continue to have good results in Latin America, most notably in Brazil and Chile. We also had a strong performance in South Africa. In Europe, results continue to be mixed. The U.K. and Russia performed very well while France and Germany were basically flat. In southern Europe, results again were very mixed, with good results in both Spain and Portugal while Ireland and Italy were marginally negative, and as you would expect, Greece had a difficult quarter.","Slide 6 shows our mix of business by industry. As you can see, we had growth in most industry sectors this quarter, with strong growth in autos, consumer products, retail, financial services and telecom and declines in pharma and travel and entertainment. The differences by sector were driven by a combination of business wins and losses and specific industry performance.","Turning to Slide 7. Our year-end cash performance was in line with our expectations. We generated about $1.25 billion of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. Our primary uses of cash were: capital expenditures of $186 million; acquisitions, including earnout payments net of proceeds received from the sale of investments, of $428 million; dividends to common shareholders of $269 million; dividends paid to minority interest shareholders of $100 million; and share repurchases, net of proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans; totaled $701 million. ","All in, we returned about $1 billion this year to our shareholders between dividends and share repurchases. And combined, this resulted in a net use of cash of approximately $438 million. Also, for anyone who missed the announcement, we recently increased our dividend again this year by 20%. So for 2012, we expect the dividend to be $0.30 per share per quarter.","To better show the great cash flow characteristics of our business, we've added Slide 8, which details the cumulative cash the company has returned to shareholders over the past 10 years, from 2002 through 2011. There are a few different lines on the chart. The top line is our cumulative net income over the period, which totaled a little more than $8.1 billion. The bottom 2 lines show the cumulative dividends paid and accumulative net share repurchases over that same period. The third line shows the combined cumulative cash returned to shareholders. In total, just over $7.7 billion or about 95% of our cumulative net income for that period was returned to shareholders. It's also worth noting that over the same 10-year period, the company's revenue and net income both basically doubled from $6.9 billion to $13.9 billion in revenue this year and from $455 million to $953 million of net income.","Slide 9 shows our current capital structure. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.4 billion, an increase of about $460 million. As the prior slide pointed out, the year-over-year increase was driven primarily by a return of about $1 billion to shareholders through the combination of dividends and share repurchases. Our leverage ratio or total debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.6x while our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 1 at 0.7x. And our interest coverage ratio remain very strong at 12.3x.","Finally on Slide 10, we continue to successfully build the company through a combination of prudently priced acquisitions and well focused internal development. As a result, both the return on invested capital and return on equity continue to improve, reaching 18.8% and 26.9%, respectively, this year.  ","There are several other supplemental slides included in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, I'm going to ask the operator to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James Dix from Wedbush.","James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions. I guess when you look at your progress towards your EBITA margin target for the year, is there any particular seasonality that you think we should be thinking about by quarter? I know that can move around, but I'm just thinking, in particular, about the repositioning charges which you took, which I think had some seasonality. I'm just wondering if there was any impact by season that we should be thinking about. And then secondly, when you look at your outlook for growth by geographic region and, in particular, Europe, is there any particular color you can provide on what you're expecting? I mean, do you really expect much growth, in particular, from the Eurozone this year?","Randall J. Weisenburger","This seasonality -- we do have seasonality across the different quarters. I think our improvement, probably a little bit back-half weighted, and we'll probably track our normal seasonality but I don't -- it shouldn't be a lot of back-half weighted. As far as geographic growth, I think there's a number of things to keep in mind. First of all, individual agency performance really supersedes the economy. If an agency goes out and, through its innovation and creativity, can grow its relationships with its existing clients, find new clients, then the economic backdrop, while it's always a factor, is really overwhelmed by the performance of the agency. So we're certainly looking to all of our agencies to use their creativity and energy to build their businesses, I'll say, despite the economies. The other thing I think that's important to keep in mind is that a large percentage of our client base are multinational clients. So they are connected. The economies around the world are linked up through those individual clients.","John Wren","The only thing I'd add to that is depending on the day that you wake up, Europe is or isn't in the headlines, and we watch it as closely as everybody else does. And our statement that we're looking to similar growth is really reflective of that. We know where we believe we will grow. We know what markets are growing at the present time that are not facing austerity and not facing the headlines every day. So we have very modest expectations across Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Janedis from UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Randy, can you talk about how you're thinking about share repurchases this year? Obviously, you upped the dividend last week. Should we expect the buyback to approach $1 billion again? And is the hope that acquisitions stay in that $400 million range for the year?","Randall J. Weisenburger","No, I don't think buybacks will approach $1 billion. We'll see. We made a commitment at the end of 2010, to between 2010 and 2011, put that $1 billion of leverage back. If people recall, in 2009, we delevered the company about $1 billion. So we decided at the end of '10 and '11 to put that back. So last year's share repurchases ended up where we overspent our free cash flow by about $450 million. We've basically committed to spending all of our free cash flow on the combination of dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. We haven't committed to go past that.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And also quickly, can you speak to the project business during the quarter? What was the impact to organic?","John Wren","You mean the fourth quarter?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes. I think the quarter came in, basically, as we expected, a little bit of a higher organic growth than we expected. But I think from a project standpoint, it was pretty much on track and kind of a normal year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just to -- first, a question to follow up, I think, on your earlier comment about the outlook in Europe. Would you say that the European performance, again, it's more of the Eurozone, not U.K., was relatively stable throughout the quarter and into what you're seeing so far into Q1? Or was there any notable change that might give us a bit more insight, and how sort of this is progressing so far -- or into 2012?","John Wren","I'd characterize it as stable. When you look at the markets that declined and then the underlying reasons, some of them that were economic and some of them -- some of the declines were cycling out of changes in clients. Netherlands comes up in particular, where we lost an account that is headquartered in The Netherlands. We won it back here in the United States. That had a slight impact. But Europe is a day-by-day event, where the conversation across the continent is austerity. So we can't be as clear or have as greater vision as we've had in the past until they get through the sovereign debt crisis.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then on the budget for -- again, more globally now and for U.S. as well. On the budgets for 2012 and I guess your conversations with your clients for spending this year, could you give us a sense on how much of the sort of the increase in revenues that you're seeing is coming from just bigger budgets, more services provided to these clients or maybe the ability to regain some pricing or get back some of the discounting you may have given them in the downturn?","John Wren","I don't think I've aggregated it client by client. But the clients, I believe, are going to spend more money, and they want to spend it in the most efficient and targeted way that they can. So I think there's a commitment on the part of most clients to increase their spending. They -- but they want to -- they want it to be in the absolutely most perfect spot and where we can prove ROI. There's plenty of money and plenty of things for us to do. So that changes client by client and industry by industry. But if I had to make a generalization, that's what -- that's how I'd answer your question.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just lastly, we -- should we assume that the pharma stays weak, I guess, for the foreseeable future?","John Wren","Again, pharma is under pressure because drugs are coming off patent. Pharma is under a lot of pressure from the government. And we did have 1 or 2 client losses which contributed to our weakness earlier in the year, which we should cycle out off in the first half of this year, which had an impact. I'm encouraged to say that offsetting those losses where we see the immediate impact, we've -- we had a very good season in the fourth quarter for winning some business, which we won't see the benefit for, for 6 to 9 months, 6 months or so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen from Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Two questions, please. One, I appreciate the information you gave on the amount you spent on cost cutting. It looks like $200 million you said and the number of divestitures. Do you have any numbers you could give us in terms of what is left do, what we can expect for 2012 in terms of divestitures and anything left to be sent -- spent on severance or other items? And then secondly, touching back on something we haven't talked about in a few years, your convertible bonds. You have a put date coming up on one of them coming in July. What are your thoughts there on the 2 converts outstanding?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Let's see, I know we have a couple of divestitures and dispositions that we continue to work on, so we know we, at least, have those to go. We'll constantly evaluate businesses, and we have a number of agencies that I'd say are on our very active watch list. So we have plans in place for them to change their business, and we'll monitor how that progresses over the course of the year. As far as severance goes, every year, there is some amount of severance. I don't think this year will be anywhere near as high as last year. We'll again monitor that as we go through the year. And as far as the converts go, based upon where the stock price and interest rates are at today, I don't believe we'd need to make any kind of a supplemental interest payment in order for the converts to stay outstanding.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Barclays Capital.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have one for Randy and then one for John. Randy, forgive me because we're little bit newer to your model than maybe some other analysts on the call. But looking ahead to 2012, I think to get to that 13.4% margin, I feel like we either need to model a pretty high incremental margin year-over-year. I think that your incremental margin in 2011 was between 15% and 20%. Where we'd have to model accelerating revenue growth in 2012? So I'm just wondering if you could give us a little more on the margin outlook and dynamic and if how headcount and personnel expenses would play a part in that. And then I have a follow-up for John, which is, you mentioned in your opening comments that all of your agencies are developing their digital capabilities. They're accelerating their expertise there. I'm curious on the digital side. Are your agencies taking organic share of the online ad networks and online ad exchanges? Do you feel that those capabilities are being built up to a greater degree, such that it sort of mitigates your need to go out and make acquisitions in the digital agency space, or is your expertise a result of acquisitions that you have made? Just trying to understand that.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Well, your first one is you're modeling the business incorrectly or, I should say, you can't really model the business the way you're doing it, from an Omnicom standpoint, to have it work. I mean, I think the modeling the way you're at least describing it would probably be perfect for an individual agency. Except in Omnicom, there's effectively 2,000 of them to try to model that way, and the complexity of the model, trying to model each individual agency in that manner just doesn't work. We've made a commitment to achieve those margin levels for 2011, as I said in my comments. While it's not without challenges or difficulties, we think we're on track to being able to achieve those numbers.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess the question is to get to those numbers, you had to take some cost actions. And I'm trying to figure out if similar cost actions are needed in 2012 to get to the 13.4% target.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Well, not similar levels of cost actions. I'm sure we'll be taking some individual cost actions. We need to manage the business agency by agency, and the only thing that is a constant is agencies change. They have client wins. They have client losses. And they need to continuously focus on managing their cost structures to keep them in line with the business levels that they have, again agency by agency. The full effect of the cost actions that we took last year won't come into play at those individual agencies until this year. And you also find that with business wins and losses, there's lag times in getting the full effect of those changes. Again, I can -- I'll just reiterate, we think we're well on track to achieving the objectives that we laid out.","John Wren","Yes. And you may have to repeat some of your question, but let me take a shot, at least, part of what you said. We've made a significant investment, and it runs through our P&L rather than through our capital acquisition accounting, in hiring people, making investments and creating the proper platforms, our using and analysis of data and the various partnerships that we've entered into. I don't have an exact number, but it approaches 90 to provide us with the information that we need. Two and a half years ago, sitting and meeting with Eric Schmidt, he predicted that he saw the day where he thought ad exchanges might be given away for free, and he has one of the largest ones. Now that won't happen anytime soon, but there'll be increased -- increasing pressure and pricing on the best ad exchanges out there. What we're focused on is what I covered in the call, having the smartest people and the creative -- most creative people to properly use technology to target clients, to find those opportunities at the absolutely proper moment and deliver to our clients the most efficient buying and delivery of audience that we possibly can. We're looking at everything. We always look at everything. We don't exclude acquisitions if we think it's going to add to our skill set or accelerate the process that -- the way we believe the marketplace is moving. The only thing that offends is ridiculous pricing, where we don't get a proper return on investment, where we make a decision that building it is more expensive maybe to the P&L and to the margins but is more sensible, in the long run, to the shareholders of Omnicom. So I don't know if I covered all of your questions.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Let me add one thing to John's comments that I find sometimes important. We're in a number of marketing disciplines. And each of those marketing disciplines is developing the capabilities to utilize new technologies like digital technology, but basically the breadth of technologies and marketing mediums that are out there in their discipline, and the utilization of those technologies is different. So when you talk about ad exchanges, that comes up against our media buying and planning businesses, and it probably touches up against some of our creative businesses. When we get into mobile and apps and some of those, it affects different of our businesses. Even in areas -- PR is hitting up with social. Very significantly, our branding businesses are going and touching up with digital technologies in different ways. So it's very important for each of our businesses to develop the capabilities to utilize those technologies, to advance its discipline or its skill sets for its clients.","John Wren","And again -- and then you can correct the questions. I mean, looking at what's been done to date is almost looking at the world through the rearview mirror. We've only seen the beginning of mobile and what its impacts is going to be and the way we're going to be able to use it. And so the change which you've seen occur is just the beginning, and that's why we kept it a very flexible, open-sourced approach to this whole area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Historically, there've been a couple of swing factors in the fourth quarter, like performance-based fees, projects, true-ups on scope of business, the kind of things you really can't call toward the very end. So I was curious where that shook out versus those X factors versus your expectations earlier in the quarter and sort of versus historical levels. And then depending on how that sort of turned out, how's the momentum building or looking in terms of first quarter as you enter the year? And on organic growth trends, is it looking kind of similar? Does it feel like it's accelerating or decelerating? Guessing not much movement.","John Wren","I don't know how -- Randy you can answer this question separate from me. We always get into the fourth quarter and with as many agencies we have around the world. There's a relatively small amount when you are talking about a $14 million business of $200 million, $300 million, which you cannot project whether or not clients across each one of those agencies are going to spend an incremental $50,000 or $100,000. Whether they do or they don't depends on what becomes very important to you guys, whether or not organic growth is 2\/10 of a percent higher or lower than what you're expecting. But that's all it means. And that's a company by company, market by market, case-by-case study. If I had to categorize, and I haven't done the math, we got some of that spending in this fourth quarter, and it contributes to our results. We didn't get it to the level that is higher level as we've seen in the past, and we didn't -- we weren't as disappointed as we have been sometimes in -- when there was an economic crisis going on. So I don't think that's going to change. I think we're going to get to every fourth quarter and still have that level of noise in our system.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes. I'd -- I'll just basically repeat what John said. Plus or minus $50 million, which is 1.5% organic growth or thereabouts in a quarter, is a pretty small number given the breadth of our operations, the number of clients that we have. We'll have to take on both sides. We don't believe plus or minus $40 million or $50 million in an individual quarter is a big number. We know a lot of investors do. This quarter, we're on probably on the high side of maybe what the expectations were, in part because we're coming off of very strong quarter last year in the fourth quarter or 2010's fourth quarter, where things really kind of rebounded to normal. I think this quarter was more or less in line with a normal fourth quarter.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And when you -- and sort of momentum carrying into 1Q?","John Wren","January, the numbers look good. And that's the best information we have at the moment.","Randall J. Weisenburger","But again, that's one month and it's the first month of the year. So we don't like too much into that.","John Wren","We're endeavoring to grow the company, let me put it that way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","First, if I could ask your margin goal this upcoming year to get back to 2007 margin level of 13.4%. Randy, do you think you could get to that level of growth and margin up there if you grew, say, organically, say, 3% for this new year, or to be pretty tough at that level?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think we're on track to hit those margin objectives. If we hit organic growth in that range, I'm pretty confident that we'll be able to achieve those numbers. There's a lot of -- well, hedge a little bit because of a lot of variables out there, but we think we're well along the way to being able to achieve it.","Craig Huber","And also, John, if I could ask on page 6 here, your revenue by industry. As you think about 2012 and given the conversations you've had with your customers, what industries are you most worried about from an advertising, digital spend for 2012 versus 2011 levels, and what areas are you most bullish on, if you will, for the new year?","John Wren","What am I most -- let me start with what I'm most bullish about. Every one of our clients, the digital aspect of how does digital impact or extend to what earned media is, is objective for each one of our clients. If I had to categorize it by industry, I'd say I'm seeing a move by packaged good companies and a greater commitment from packaged good companies than they have in the past, as a general category, in using digital in every one of their campaigns and trying to get the most efficient use of their media dollars.","Craig Huber","What about the other side, the negative side? What are you most worried about? What categories?","John Wren","Craig, you know me, I worry about everything. You should see my to-do list. But there's nothing specific or any specific client at the moment couched in that regard. The -- my biggest concerns are whereas the government claims we have no inflation in the United States, when you get outside the United States, there's huge inflation soaring. You never know what that's going to do to the consumer and where they spend their money. That's probably in the top 1 or 2 or 3 of my concerns on behalf of my clients and how do we become more efficient. And that's the challenge that every Omnicom employee has every day, to make every dollar that our clients spend more productive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A couple for Randy. And, Randy, if you could you help us on Page 6, keeping with that same theme. Financial services grew 35% looks like in the quarter, and many of us in financial services don't see anything wrong with 35% these days. So we wondered, where is that coming from, what kind of clients, what kind of markets? What was the source of that great growth?","John Wren","Volume bonuses.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Wasn't your bonus up 35%? Some of it is the base that you're comparing off. This, in particular, was a combination of, I'll say, good broad performance, as well as a couple of client wins and some project revenue.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And was there any market in particular that was affected by that which -- by region?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think the U.S. was the -- a bigger -- the bigger piece of it.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. That's one, and then second on severance. To be sure, you're including the -- when you say $200 million, that includes the action in the first quarter from Clemenger?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just -- not in Clemenger, but you see action in the first quarter basically repositioning.","Randall J. Weisenburger","That's full year severance charges. In that repositioning charges, there were other charges other than severance that are not in that number. That -- the $202 million is just severance.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And I know -- listen, I've covered you long enough to ask you this without -- it's a loaded question. No year is typical, but in general, $200 million in what's a good growing year. If '12 looks like '11, what is the normal range of severance for Omnicom?","Randall J. Weisenburger","I would think $50 million to $60 million.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. So that's definitely a place where you'll benefit in this year. Then lastly, incentive comp. How big was incentive comp this year, and did that differ materially from last year?","John Wren","It was up significantly, year-over-year.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think we had a -- I think this year's incentive comp was a full number. I don't think it was abnormally low. So I think it was a pretty solid -- or maybe another way to say it is, the incentive comp bucket was full.","Operator","And our next question will come from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Randy, just to jump back to uses of free cash flow. You said that in -- you and John both mentioned in your prepared remarks sort of a renewed focus on growth. And I'm just wondering, I know you had a big chunk in Clemenger in the first quarter, but would you expect upwards of $400 million in acquisition spending again this year? And then just secondly, any quick comments on changes you're seeing in the labor market these days, particularly around digital talent or sort of consistent upward trends there?","Randall J. Weisenburger","First, acquisitions within a band is hard to predict. This year, we did a handful of, I'll say, midsized acquisitions, and they were done not on our typical earnout basis. The Mudra deal wasn't really an earnout. Clemenger was a large acquisition. Marina Maher wasn't done on an earnout basis and a couple of others were in that. Communispace was another","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I'd now like to now introduce you to today's conference call host, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Omnicom Group, Mr. Randall Weisenburger. Please go ahead.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our third quarter 2012 earnings call. We hope everyone had a chance to review our earnings release. We posted to our website both the press release and the presentation covering the information that we'll be presenting this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I've been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that's included on the last page of our investor presentation. And to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectations, and actual events or results may differ materially.","I'd also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. You can find a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.","We're going to begin the call with some brief remarks from John Wren. Then following John's remarks, we'll review our financial performance for the quarter, and then both John and I will be happy to take questions.","John D. Wren","Good morning. Thank you for joining us on the call. We are now 3 quarters through 2012, and I'm pleased to say that our performance over the quarter and for the year-to-date remains strong.","Let me start by talking through some of the key points driving our business results and strategies, and then I will provide some perspective on the larger business environment.","The third quarter was another solid quarter for Omnicom and our companies. Our broad geographic footprint, diversified expertise and emphasis on creative excellence has benefited both our clients and our shareholders. For the quarter, we continue to generate solid organic growth, particularly in light of the macroeconomic environment. And our margin performance remained strong, keeping us on track to achieve our margin objective for the year.","Before getting into the specifics of our third quarter performance, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the strategies that have allowed us to continue to achieve consistent results:  First, our investment in the best talent; next, expanding our footprint geographically and in new service areas; also expanding our digital, analytical and consumer insight capabilities; and finally, an increasing coordination of our service offering on our top 50 clients.","A few weeks ago, we returned from the Spikes Advertising Festival, Asia's most prestigious creative awards show where 30 different Omnicom agencies won a record 117 awards, including first and second prize for Network of the Year by BBDO and DDB. This performance significantly outpaced our competition. I think this recognition is important in illustrating how the different components of our strategies come together to benefit our clients. It also shows our progress in growing our portfolio geographically to include what we believe are the most effective and creative agencies in the Asia Pacific region.","Expanding in developing markets will continue to be a core strategic focus of Omnicom. In the third quarter, our revenue outside the U.S., U.K. and Eurozone accounted for almost 24% of our top line.","We also know that our success is increasingly being supported by what goes on behind the scenes in our networks and agencies. Across many of our clients, but especially for our top 50 clients which are served by multiple agencies in our group, our people are collaborating more closely to share insights and ideas and increasingly working together to achieve common objectives. These collaborations are successful because they bring together our top talent from different agencies to provide integrated solutions across brands, disciplines and geographies.","Collaboration and coordination across our agencies is even more important today in servicing our major clients as many of them are seeking to consolidate their advertising and marketing spend across a smaller group of agencies.","Overall, we have been successful in gaining a greater share of business in these consolidations while providing clients more integrated services and operational efficiencies.","We're also benefiting from stronger digital capabilities within our agencies and from our increased focus on using data and analytics to generate valuable insights and drive results. As I have said before, the industry is only at the beginning of learning how to use these new technologies to effectively communicate with consumers. And these new technologies are changing quite rapidly, requiring us to continually change and adapt.","While each of our agencies is developing digital and analytical skill sets, we are also increasingly leveraging our investment in Annalect. Annalect, which includes our search business, resolution media, our mobile and display businesses, now has over 600 employees servicing clients in more than 30 markets around the world.","Overall, we are firmly committed to bringing the best talent, creative, digital and analytical tools to our clients. And clients, existing and new, are responding by expanding our mandates and awarding us new pieces of business.","Of course, we must always be conscious that we're operating in what remains a fragile economic environment. As we invest in areas with significant growth potential, we do so carefully and we remain vigilant in managing our expenses. Our goal is to take advantage of growth opportunities while remaining flexible and agile enough to respond to the changing economic conditions.","As we've noted in the past few quarters we continue to keep a close eye on the macroeconomic picture. While we remain cautiously optimistic about our business, we recognize that political and economic uncertainty, as was most recently highlighted by the IMF, could negatively impact global growth this year and next. With this in mind, in every market we are working with our companies to assess the impact of economic shifts while continuing to focus on the things we can control: investing in talent, expanding our capabilities and adapting quickly to a more complex, technologically driven environment.","Now I'd like to turn my attention to the third quarter. Organic growth for the quarter was a solid 3.5%. This performance was driven in large part by the U.S. and developing international markets. Our advertising business also continued to perform extremely well followed by our CRM business.","Looking more closely at revenue by geography. We saw continued strength in the U.S. with organic growth of 3.1%. Although this was somewhat slower than what we had experienced in the first half, U.S. growth was driven by strong results in advertising, media and sports and event marketing.","The U.K. was essentially flat for the quarter, weighed down by a slowdown in our field marketing operations. Outside of this one operation, the overall market performance was quite positive, supported in part by the Olympics-related spend.","Euro region growth was a negative 1.8% for the quarter, although the performance by market again varied. Germany and France and the Netherlands were negative while Italy, Portugal and Spain were all positive due to the strength of our individual businesses in those markets. However, given the state of these economies, we remain very cautious.","I should note our European management teams have clearly been facing the most challenging conditions across our global footprint, but they continue to do a very good job of servicing their clients and at the same time managing their cost structures.","Outside the Eurozone, the Czech Republic, Russia and Turkey had strong performances. And notwithstanding the less robust growth expectations in developing markets, Latin America and Asia each experienced double-digit growth for us during the quarter. Latin America was driven by Brazil and Chile, and Argentina was also positive.  In Asia, we had above average performances in China, Japan, India and Singapore.","Looking at revenue growth by industry. Auto and consumer products, retail and technology were among the better-performing sectors. And net new business was over $1 billion for the quarter.","Let me now turn to our capital structure and use of cash. We are operating in an environment with historically low interest rates and continue to look for ways to use this as an opportunity to optimize our balance sheet, provide for continued growth and to ensure that shareholders are the major beneficiaries of Omnicom's strong cash flows. In the second quarter, we raised $750 million in new debt, and during the third quarter we raised an additional $500 million at a yield of just under 3%. We also continued to repurchase shares during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to over $700 million.","Even with these new financings and repurchases, our balance sheet and credit ratings remain extremely strong. The new capital provides us with greater flexibility to invest in our existing businesses and to add new ones where appropriate.","On the acquisition front, we believe valuations have become inflated in many areas, particularly in digital. We are committed to maintaining a disciplined approach to acquisitions and will only pursue transactions that allow us to further our strategic goals and that meet the tests of fit and price.","Before I finish, I want to note that we have continued to manage our businesses carefully by removing unnecessary costs and making smart investments in growth. This diligence has paid off and we fully expect to deliver on our 2012 margin targets.","I'll now turn the call back to Randy who'll take you through our numbers in more detail.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Thank you, John. As John pointed out, this was a very solid quarter for our agencies. We continue to track very well against our objectives for the year despite a difficult economic backdrop that has not improved as we'd expected coming into the year.","Our agencies have done very well this year on the new business front with both account consolidations and continuing to develop innovative new services for their clients. At the same time, they've made excellent progress managing their costs and realigning their cost structures where necessary. And as this quarter highlights, our agencies continue to make excellent progress building the brands, mostly organically, in the developing markets.","Now for the quarter. Revenue came in at a little over $3.4 billion, which was driven by solid organic growth of 3.5% and in spite of a continuing stiff FX headwind, which this quarter was a negative 3.4%. But I'll address our revenue growth in more detail in a few minutes.","EBITA increased 4.4% to $414.6 million and margins this quarter were 12.2%, up about 50 basis points from last year. For the 9 months, we're now a little ahead of schedule but that's mostly timing. We expect to achieve our previously stated margin target of 13.4% for the full year.","Similarly, operating income, or EBIT, for the quarter increased 3.7% to $387 million.  And our resulting operating margin of 11.4% was a year-over-year improvement of about 40 basis points.","Amortization of intangibles was up about $3.6 million this quarter, about $2 million of which resulted from a nonrecurring impairment charge. And the balance was due to an increase in amortizable intangibles related to acquisitions.","Slide 2 addresses the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $40.3 million, up $8.4 million from Q3 of last year and up $5.4 million from the second quarter. In the second quarter, we issued $750 million of 10-year 3 5\/8% notes. And this quarter, we opportunistically added $500 million to that same issue at an effective rate of about 3%.","Both the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increase in interest expense is predominantly due to the interest paid on these new notes, offset by interest income earned on the increased cash balances. However, the rates earned on cash balances is quite well in the current environment.","On the tax front, our reported rate for the quarter was 34.2%, basically flat with our Q3 rate last year and remains in line with our expected operating tax rate for the year. Earnings from our equity interest in affiliates increased just under $1 million to $5.3 million this quarter. And additionally, the allocation of earnings to the minority owners in our less-than-fully owned subsidiaries increased $4.5 million to $29.7 million. This increase was due primarily to the strong performance of many of our international subsidiaries outside of the Eurozone where some of our ownership structures include minority ownership by our senior management teams as well as additional minority interests in several of our recent acquisitions. And the aggregate result was net income increasing to $203.9 million for the quarter.","On Slide 3, we show the allocation of net income to common shareholders and participating securities as well as our diluted share count, which is down year-over-year by 4.6%, and the computation of our diluted earnings per share, which for the quarter increased 2.8% to $0.74 per share.","On Slide 4, we take a closer look at our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX. On a year-over-year basis, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against almost all of our major currencies except for the Chinese renminbi. The net result was, as I mentioned earlier, a very stiff headwind that reduced revenue for the quarter by 3.4% or about $115 million.","Fortunately, as we've discussed in the past, the majority of our costs are incurred in the same currency as our revenues. So while there's a pro rata effect on earnings, there is a minimal effect on our operating margin.","FX rates over the past month or so have stabilized somewhat. Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are currently, we expect FX to be negative by only about 75 basis points in Q4 and negative about 2.5% for the full year.","Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $23.5 million in the quarter or 0.7%. In addition to the 4 new acquisitions completed during Q3, we continued to benefit from the acquisitions completed over the past 12 months, including Mudra in India, MCI in Japan and Marina Maher. We also continue to feel the effect of the dispositions that we completed mostly during the second half of 2011.","While we've started to cycle on several of these dispositions, we'll not fully cycle through until 2013. So at this point, if we don't complete another acquisition or disposition for the balance of the year, the net acquisition revenue will be positive about 40 basis points in Q4.","And with regard to organic growth. While increasingly mixed by market and industry sector, overall we had another very solid quarter, up 3.5% or about $118 million. This quarter, we continued to perform well in North America and we had double-digit growth in South America, Asia, Africa and Russia. However, this was offset by the ongoing sluggish performance across Europe.","Our new business performance continued to be strong in the quarter with net wins of just over $1 billion as we continue to benefit from some of the larger account consolidation movements that are occurring in the marketplace. And our agencies have continued to successfully develop innovative services utilizing the many new technologies and communication platforms that are available today.","Turning to our mix of business on Slide 5. Brand advertising accounted for 47% of our revenue; and marketing and services, 53%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising's organic growth was 5.7%, driven by continued strong growth in our media businesses, emerging markets and new technology services. And marketing services was up 1.6%.","Within marketing services, CRM had an organic growth of 2.4%, public relations was slightly down at 0.3%, as was specialty communications. While still negative, this quarter was a significant improvement from the first half.  While we continue to see spending cuts in the pharma and health care sector, we have benefited from some of the account consolidation initiatives. As a result, we expect to cycle through the difficult comps next year and see this sector turn into a positive.","Turning to Slides 6 and 7. Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was split 52% in the U.S., 15% in the euro markets, 9% the U.K. and 24% rest of world. In the United States, revenue increased $55 million or 3.2%. Organic growth continued to be solid generally across disciplines and industries at 3.1% or $53.4 million. And acquisitions, net of dispositions, was marginally positive, adding $1.5 million.","International revenue decreased $29 million or about 1.7%. As I mentioned, FX continued to create a strong headwind causing a revenue decline of about 6.9% or $115 million.","Acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $22 million. And organic growth, although extremely mixed by region, continued to be solid overall at a positive 3.8% or $64 million.","Looking at the organic growth by market. In Europe, of the larger countries, Russia continued to perform very well, the U.K. was essentially flat and Germany, France and the Netherlands were down. In aggregate, the Eurozone markets were down 1.8% organically.","In Asia, we continue to have strong performances across the region with double-digit growth overall. This quarter, China, India, Japan, Hong Kong and Indonesia led the way. In other parts of the world, we had strong performances in Canada, Brazil, Chile and Africa.","Turning to Slide 8, which shows our mix of business by industry. There were no significant changes, either year-over-year or versus the second quarter of 2012. As for growth rates, while still quite mixed by sector, this quarter we had solid performances in auto, retail, technology and consumer products.","Turning to Slide 9. Our cash performance for the first 9 months was very good with free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, increasing just over $100 million to $966 million.","On Slide 10, the breakdown of our primary uses of cash for the 9 months included dividends to common shareholders of $235 million. The year-over-year increase reflects both the 20% increase in our quarterly dividend and the reduction of our share count; dividends paid to minority interest shareholders of $79 million; capital expenditures of $159 million. As we've mentioned on earlier calls, CapEx is planned to be up this year primarily due to a couple of sizable office makeovers related to long-term lease renewals, as well as increased IT spending related to our IT consolidation initiative.","Acquisitions, including contingent purchase price payments, net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled just under $159 million. And share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $714 million. In total, and again excluding working capital, year-to-date we've outspent our free cash by about $380 million.","Slide 11 shows our current capital structure. As we mentioned earlier, in August, we added an additional $500 million in 10-year senior notes to the $750 million issue we completed in Q2. As a result, year-over-year, our total debt increased by $1.25 billion to $4.46 billion. However, our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.5 billion, an increase of $200 million from the same time last year.","As a result of the increased debt, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 2.2x although our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio remained flat at 1.2x. Also, our interest coverage ratio remains very strong at 11.9x.","And finally, on Slide 12, as we've continued to successfully build the company through a combination of prudently priced acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives, both the return on invested capital and return on equity have remained very strong. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital was 15.7% and our return on equity improved to 28.3%.","This concludes our prepared remarks. There are several other supplemental slides included in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, I'm going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you again.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a question on the sort of overall advertising outlook that you're seeing right now. Has there been a change in sort of client mentality on spending? I noticed just a little bit of a slowdown versus the strong organic growth you saw on the first half. Is it more that budgets were set and they kind of overspent in the beginning and now they're compensating, but the mentality hasn't really changed or are you seeing more of a bit of a pull in?","John D. Wren","I don't think there's any one answer to that question, Alexi. It's all of the above. With the uncertainty that is reported every day in the newspapers about China being off a little bit, that Europe's not solved yet and the uncertainty with the fiscal cliff as people await the election. There's conservatism and we're not certain yet what the outcome is going to be in the fourth quarter or as we get into the first quarter of next year. We do know that we're performing very well and we're engaged in very positive conversations with our clients. But there's no single answer or generalization I can put -- I can come up with to answer you.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But it generally sounds -- generally feels though like a pretty healthy environment. I don't want to read too much into a slight slowdown in growth. Is that fair?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes, we came into the year thinking 4% for the full year was a good number. I still think 4%, that range is probably still a good full year number. The timing of the spend year-over-year can obviously move around quite a bit. We had a very strong first half, but again I don't think -- we're not ready to change our full year numbers yet.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just a follow-up on the margin. You beat expectations now for most of the year. I think you mentioned in your opening remarks you're still on target for your goal. I guess, can we assume a little upside given the strength going into the fourth quarter to your goal for EBITA for the year?","Randall J. Weisenburger","No.","John D. Wren","No. I mean, we're willing to commit to what we committed to a year ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","A question for you is margin targets for this year of 13.4%. Is there anything, Randy, that you're doing on the cost front that you've already put in place for this year or planning to do in the fourth quarter that may potentially have a tough cost comparison for 2013?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Well, I think these \u2013 well, I've said it for a number of years. I think the margins -- our margin target for this year is a very good overall margin given Omnicom's mix of business and our commitment to constantly invest in our businesses, our training programs, et cetera. Yes, so I think this year is going to be a very tough comp for next year. I think our agencies are up to that challenge. But I think these are good numbers.","Craig Huber","And then also, could you speak a little bit further about what you're seeing over in Europe. Is your sense over there that things are getting worse, about the same or getting better on the confidence levels, the economic backdrop in your major markets over there?","John D. Wren","There's still a great deal of uncertainty in Europe. Southern Europe, the problems aren't resolved and you have political change which is recent in France. Ultimately, the Germans are going to have to probably pay the bill, but they're going to have to decide when they're going to do that. So I don't see any improvement to the European market in the near term. I think they're at a very fragile point and they seem to be working their way through it, but I'm not prepared or ready to declare it solved in any way, manner, make, shape or form. So we continue to manage our businesses market-by-market, office-by-office in response to what the changing environment is.","Craig Huber","And then lastly, if I could, just a quick housekeeping question. Randy, would you -- could you just break apart your salary line versus O&G and also for your interest expense line, break that apart, please?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Let's see. Salaries -- salary and service cost is $215 million -- $216 million. And office and general is $503 million. And interest, let me see, interest expense is $47.8 million. Interest income is $7.5 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen from Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","A couple of things, please. Could you please elaborate a little bit more on your discussion on digital\/analytical\/consumer insight? Is this just continuing the work you've been doing in digital or are we detecting -- am I detecting a new tone here in things that you're doing? Are you ramping up some of your efforts there? Likewise, you talked about collaboration across your agencies. Are there further central cost savings that you might seek to achieve once you've gotten to this margin target level for this year? And likewise, is that kind of a new program or an extended effort? And then lastly, on share buybacks, you've given, it looks like kind of a net figure on share buybacks. Is there a like a gross number you could give us what the actual dollar spent on just share buybacks in Q3, please?","John D. Wren","Sure. The first part of your question, if you'd repeat it, I'm sorry?","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Yes. It was about your discussion on analytical and consumer insights. Should we detect that you're doing more work in this area? And I don't think -- you really haven't talked a whole lot about that in the past.","John D. Wren","Yes, and probably the fault is having not spoken about it more directly in the past. What we've elected to do, we've been doing it now for at least 2 years, is investing very heavily through the P&L rather than through doing large acquisitions in developing and expanding our digital capabilities across-the-board. But I highlighted in the call Annalect and a number of companies that are engaged in almost purely digital items. And those investments continue to be made. We're making a lot of progress and getting to our first line of products, which we're deploying to our clients and that's only going to speed up and continue. What we do see during the quarter was significant growth. Not big dollar amounts yet, but significant growth in the use of mobile for the first time. And I think that's ultimately where the future is and that will ultimately unleash the floodgates. But the whole industry is moving in that direction. So we've just started to discuss it a bit more then, but our commitment to it has been more across-the-board for quite a while. The second part of your question?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Your second question, I think, has sort of 2 parts to it. The comments, I think, John was making about collaboration is our efforts to provide more innovative, comprehensive service to our clients and by increasing the coordination amongst our agencies around those clients. We've described them in the past as client-centric networks. You took it on the cost savings side. There are a number of -- unrelated to that really, there are a number of initiatives that have been going on with Omnicom for the last couple of years. We announced them pretty strong last year about centralizing various functions in efforts to drive our costs down. Obviously, those efforts are continuous. They're going to be ongoing for a long time. And then once we're done with those initiatives, hopefully we're developing more initiatives as we go because we're certainly charged from our clients with the task of constantly improving the efficiency of overall operations. And your final question was stock purchases in the quarter. I think we spent about $195.7 million and it was roughly 3,708,000 shares.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Janedis from UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of toughies here for you guys. One is, I know it's early but you have a sense of discretionary or project spend for later in the quarter? And then secondly, John, can you maybe give us a little bit more color on how your clients are approaching the fiscal cliff?","John D. Wren","Well, first of all, we wind up going through this every year. There is a certain amount of money that most years in the past 2 decades has gotten spent in the fourth quarter. There has been 1 year, 2008, I think where it didn't. And there's a certain amount of unknown and that won't become clarified until -- as we go through the quarter. It's way too early in the fourth quarter to know exactly what that's going to be. Our clients are, especially our multinational clients, go where the sales are. I mean, so -- and go where there's more certainty. That's why you see Europe slowing down. U.S. has held together pretty well considering all the uncertainty associated with the election and the decisions that the country has to make in terms of how we're going to go forward in the near term. And Asia, Asia's going -- especially China is going through a change in leadership. There's been a modest reduction in growth there. But we think it's only temporary and as the transition gets fully affected, you'll see that market return to growth as well. So it's a -- it's like the headlines at the moment. People are, to the extent that they can, shifting their tactics to meet the current economic situation.","Randall J. Weisenburger","And fortunately, due to the diversified nature of our business, frankly, our revenues have held up in many markets much, much better than overall media spend. We've seen, especially some of the Southern European countries, dramatic reductions in media spend and we've had \u2013 they're pretty significant reductions, if you're the agency with the reduction. But on a relative basis, our agencies have done very well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","With regard to your European managers, is it more difficult for them to forecast given the macro uncertainties out there? When you guys compare your forecast and actual results, do you tend to see a wider variance, either to the upside or downside, in Europe? And then I got one quick follow-up.","John D. Wren","There's constant reforecasting, recalibration. I wouldn't characterize their job as more or less difficult than anybody else's around the world. But again, when economies are weak when you're seeking what in the press is called the new normal and it hasn't arrived yet, you're very vigilant. You're watching all the time and you're adjusting constantly.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think it also depends upon which forecast you're talking about. So a 3 months out forecast, I don't think there's any significant difference I'll say in the volatility of their forecast -- European forecast versus other markets. If you went out a year, I'm sure it's a bit more uncertainty in their forecast. It's not a matter of a difference of accuracy, but it's certainly the uncertainty that they're facing.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then, Randy, could you offer a little color on severance, how that's been tracking through the quarter and maybe expectations for the year?","Randall J. Weisenburger","It's basically been tracking as we had expected. It's I think down a little bit from this quarter last year, but largely in line. This year, severance is down quite a bit from last year in the aggregate. If you remember, we had the fairly large restructuring initiative that we took in the first quarter of last year. Absent that, it's pretty much tracked quarter-to-quarter.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you just say -- I mean, are we elevated over normal run rates still at this point?","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes.","John D. Wren","Yes, and if I can just add one comment. It's more expensive to make adjustments to your staff in Europe than it is in almost any other market in the world, only because of the social policies that are in place. That's improving somewhat, but still when there's lower growth, we need to go in and adjust that from time-to-time.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes, we would -- I'm not quite sure when a normal year is anymore, but we used to think that a normal year of severance was probably in the $60-or-so million range and through 9 months we're well above $70 million. So it's definitely up versus a so-called normal year.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And it sounds like Europe is still a work in progress?","John D. Wren","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have 2 to you guys. One is could you talk about a bit about auto growth. It's been a great category. If there's any growth differences by region for us, how much of that's U.S.? And then I don't want to read too much in one data point, but if you talk a bit also about public relations, it was down this quarter. I know you had a tough comp, but if you go back to like back to '08, it was a pretty good canary in the coal mine for some slowing. So what's happening, do you think, in PR? And then talk about oil for a second.","John D. Wren","Auto growth, I don't have it broken down market-by-market. I don't know if Randy has got them. I would imagine our Japanese clients are going to have a little bit of difficulty in the fourth quarter because of the conflict with Japan, but hopefully that'll pass quickly. But auto growth has been strong. In the U.S., it's been strong. In China, it's been strong. In Brazil, throughout the entire year. And your second\u2026","Randall J. Weisenburger","And your second...","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Was PR. I know it's only one quarter and it's a tough comp, but what's happened there and is that potential canary in the coal mine for others slowing?","John D. Wren","I don't see it as a canary in the coal mine.","Randall J. Weisenburger","No, I don't either. And frankly, I think our PR businesses in general are doing pretty well. I certainly haven't heard anything serious negatives or slowdowns or things from our firms. I think the -- it's a pretty modest decline, 0.3 point. I think it's probably activities.","John D. Wren","Yes. I mean we haven't studied it client-by-client. I think as you're looking forward at PR, and I don't know when this starts to show up in the numbers. Increasingly, clients especially in a social media environment, are talking about doing more PR as part of overall campaign planning. Again, not \u2013 I'm trying to tie it to the product rather than tie it to the actual reported results. But not terribly aware of any significant issues.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. The first is when you look at the swing factors that you have every fourth quarter in terms of the project work and the kind of incentive payments that may -- that hopefully come in and some of the true-ups, how do you -- what's your confidence level in those dollars coming in this year versus last year? Is it about the same or \u2013 when you think about that? And the second question is you kind of highlighted, I think in your prepared remarks, that the private valuations remain somewhat lofty. And I was wondering if that -- how much longer does that have to sustain itself before it maybe translates into a more direct change in capital allocation decisions like a change in stock buyback levels or things like that?","John D. Wren","With respect to the second part of your question, increasingly clients are looking to go to a smaller group of agencies to reduce the roster number of vendors that they have to interface with. So a lot of -- in my view, a lot of the valuations for one-off small digital companies have been good on the owners because they've gotten decent prices through selling it but they're not really justified when you compare it to the growth in the general market and some of the trends, which are going on. And again, we're in the service business. The average age of our employees is early 30s. The digital capability of those people becomes more ingrained in everyday and the distinction between what was called traditional in digital diminishes every day. I think what does improve is the information and our ability to analyze the information and direct the messaging to individuals and to measure those results. And that's the trend that's well in place and going to only continue. With respect to the first part of your question\u2026","Randall J. Weisenburger","Every year, in the fourth quarter, there's a couple hundred million dollars of sort of that, I'm going to call it project spend, call it whatever we want to call it. Every year it's about that same number. I got to say every year we have about the same insight to it, which is pretty minimal. Given the economic backdrop of what's out in the marketplace and frankly the fact that it's an Olympic year and I think people may, because it's an Olympic year, move their spend around more. It's certainly more difficult to predict especially on a year-over-year basis all those factors. Probably make me feel even a little less comfortable than I did last year, which wasn't very comfortable because we don't have a lot of insight into that number.","John D. Wren","And with respect to the other parts of your question, we're running the business on a -- we're a service business on a long-term basis and reporting it every 90 days. So the swings in any 90-day period may not be impactful to our conclusions about what the long-term correct thing to do in terms of running our business are. So we go into fourth quarter with a certain amount of uncertainty about the next 90 days, less uncertainty about whether we're making the correct decisions about our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Randy, I'm curious in the Eurozone, I think you mentioned down around 2%, maybe a little less in the quarter. I don't know what the year-to-date number is, but do you think that's a reflection of share gains for your agencies? That seems, given everything we see in Europe, actually a pretty good result. Then I have a follow-up.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Well, I don't know if it's -- I mean, I think there's a variety of factors. One, we've got a very diversified set of businesses. I mentioned that on an earlier question. I certainly think that helps us. I think our revenues at our agencies have held up pretty well given the economic backdrop and what I see is just overall media spend. I think a lot of that has to do with frankly the hard work of the people at our agencies, and frankly, the innovative ideas that they're coming up with for their clients to serve them better and more efficiently in the marketplace. Again, great ideas are valuable to clients. I think our agencies have done pretty well on that front. It's hard to say whether or not we have a share gain or not, but I do think our agencies are doing pretty well.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then just touching on, John, you mentioned in your prepared remarks a couple of times account consolidation. And it seems like this sort of goes in and out of favor. What's driving it now? Is it sector specific or more broad? And do you think it continues to drive the kind of M&A we've seen in the market? We've seen small deals for a while, but it seems like the large M&A consolidation in the sectors seems to be picking up? I don't know if they're related to that account consolidation trend or independent or have any impact on, be curious on your thoughts on that.","John D. Wren","Well, I think the account consolidation is a trend that is in place and quite a number of our clients are going through the process and quite a number of our clients and other people's clients are discussing the process. And I think that's driven by a desire, in a low growth environment, to gain efficiencies. I also think the shift in media mix and how you reach consumers also has an impact on wanting to depend and deal on fewer people and not have an unlimited number of vendors that's serving you up specialties, which you may respond to and haven't fully thought through in terms of what is the most effective way to get to a consumer. So I think this trend is in place for now and I think it will only continue because companies -- our clients, most of the major companies around the world are under some degree of pressure to become more efficient. And so that's where we are today and I think as we go into 2013 and...","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Do you think it drives the sort of holdco-level M&A we're starting to see a little bit of? Does it -- is there a relationship to those?","John D. Wren","I mean I think if you're talking about the advertising marketing business, the numbers on some things versus the revenue are big, but on some things that have gotten done -- but the industry, itself, is fairly narrow. So I mean we've seen Dentsu active and we've seen some people clean up some so-called digital companies, which have been in the marketplace for quite some time. But I don't see a huge M&A activity in our space and I can't predict what'll happen to some of the smaller remaining players over the course of the next year. Money is very cheap, so it makes some of those decisions easy in the short run for people to spend money on deals.","Randall J. Weisenburger","I think the 2 thoughts are a bit unrelated. I don't believe account consolidations are what's driving any of the thinking around M&A activity in the industry. I think the account consolidations idea, this has been kind of an ongoing trend in parts for quite some time. It was done on a regional basis. It was done on various brands. Now you're seeing a few more global changes. I think from our industry's perspective, I think when you have a difficult economic backdrop, when companies are under more economic pressure, I think it forces change. Or it forces -- it certainly encourages them to attempt change to try and get more efficient. But I think that initiative is going on in the marketplace and we'll see how it all plays through.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Chesler from Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I think just about all my questions have been answered and asked. But I think I'll just riff off of a couple other ones I've heard.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Because I never heard you not to be with a question.","Matthew Chesler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I won't disappoint you. The notion that valuations are still inflated, does that have any implications on how you invest internally, organically in tools to stay ahead of the curve with regard to new disciplines, or are those separate?","John D. Wren","My reference was to digital acquisitions, so it's not all acquisitions, number one. And number two, we made a commitment several years ago to make certain that every one of our employees was trained, developed and up to the standards of understanding digital in the way it affects what our products are. So we've heavily invested every year. We continue to make those internal investments at a very sizable pace, specifically in the areas of mobile, analytics, data and what the future will be, all of that ultimately aiding our ability to measure what we do and to be able to provide increasing ROI for our activities. I don't know if Randy wants to add to this.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes, I think it's right. I mean, I think with fully [ph] all of our acquisitions, especially through with some of the smaller ones, it's really a make-or-buy at a good price for our shareholders. Acquisitions are fantastic. They can accelerate change, they can get you to where you want to be faster versus starting from scratch and trying to build it. But we found for the better returns for our shareholders, a constant focus on building our business internally has proven to work pretty well in most cases. Doesn't mean that we're not going to do acquisitions. They just have to be right price for our shareholders as well. We're getting pretty close to 9:30, so, Matt, if you've got other question or one more question from the field? But either way, we'll call it after one more question. Is there another question on the line, operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just wanted to go back to your discussion around analytics and Annalect, in particular, Accuen The Trading Desk. And some market participants have claimed maybe that The Trading Desk has become an unfortunate sort of layer in the media buying processes, programmatic becomes a small but growing part of the mix of media buying. Do you agree with that assessment? And whether or not you do, how do you see those analytics and particularly trading desk functions evolving over time? Is it to be a sort of specialized group, a SWAT team, so to speak, within OMD and PHD? Or is it more and more being aligned with some of your client teams directly?","John D. Wren","Well, it's clearly being aligned for the benefit of our client teams as a utility, in effect, for both our media-buying activities as well as some our other activities and campaigns. The pace at which the digital marketplace occurs and then the manner in which it's done instead of using physical bodies, but almost through algorithms where in nanoseconds things are purchased, and then if not producing the kind of ROI, resold off back into the market, I think looking way into the future, that kind of an auction will occur for almost all media. But just because the technology existed though, it doesn't mean that it will happen overnight. And it's slow. TV still gets done in the same -- similar fashion to how it was once done, as is outdoor, as is other major components, which are a key part of the mix. So it's a process of evolution. I think at the core of it is going to be -- and the determinant to where these analytics go is going to be what privacy laws become and whether you wind up with public information, which you can access to target or do you have to build your own ability to measure consumers than to target consumers. And the question hasn't been resolved yet. And I think it's going to take quite a while before some of these privacy issues do get resolved and I think that will dictate a good deal of the future. The problem isn't lack of data. There's always been too much data. The problem is how do you make the data you have actionable and useful and where you can analyze it in a fashion that you can get insights and then act upon them in an appropriate amount of time.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Yes, I think a couple of things to add. One is to keep in mind that these trading platforms have only been around for a couple of years at this point. So the development of them and how they're going to work out, we have to realize that they're only a couple of years old. Frankly, being involved in them \u2013 with them, there's a huge value in learning how they can work, et cetera. On a long-term basis, it's not really about the technology. It's about the insights in utilizing the technology or as John points out, there's a lot of data, but there's limited number of people that have the ability to get real insight out of that data. That's what our ultimate business is. Now in the early stages, we have to be somewhat the technology player, the data player because those things are all new. But on a long-term basis, it's going to be that insight that we can bring to our clients that's going to make the difference.","John D. Wren","And just final point on it. I think we're just at the beginning of the -- of where mobile will go. And as more money gets spent and we become more efficient in reaching consumers using mobile devices, because that remote control's with you 24 hours a day and generally always in your pocket, whatever shifts we've seen up until now, we're going to see yet another seismic shift.","Randall J. Weisenburger","And let me thank everyone for taking the time to listen to our call. And I guess the fourth quarter's going to be on us...","John D. Wren","Well, the fourth quarter is on us.","Randall J. Weisenburger","Is on us. The fourth quarter earnings will be here in no time.

Then Phil Angelastro will review our financial results for the quarter, and then we will open up the line for your questions.","John Wren","Thank you, Shub. Good morning. Thank you for joining the call this morning. I'm pleased to speak with you about our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results. 2018 was another year of ongoing change for the marketing and advertising industry. We continue to see many of the world's top marketers transform their marketing organizations to adapt to changing consumer behaviors and new disruptive competitors.","For Omnicom, change provides opportunities, challenges and ample room for differentiation. I'm pleased to report that in this rapidly changing environment, our strategies, talent and execution have allowed us to continue to deliver solid financial results.","For the full-year 2018, we achieved our internal organic growth and margin targets. Organic growth for the quarter was 3.2%. For the full-year 2018, organic growth was 2.6%. Our EBIT margin for the quarter was 15.3%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.","For the year, our EBIT margin, excluding the effect of our third quarter dispositions and repositioning actions was 13.8%, an increase of 20 basis points versus the prior year. EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.77 per share, which compares to a $1.55 per share in the prior year, excluding the charge related to the U.S. Tax Act that we took in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 14%.","We achieved these goals by growing our strong base of talented people, investing in technology and analytic capabilities as well as continuing to differentiate our organization structure, so we can deliver custom integrated solutions that drive business growth for our clients. Taken together, these strategic steps have helped us grow both our top and bottom line.","In the quarter, we grew organically in every geographic region of the world with broad participation across our agencies, disciplines and client sectors. Looking at the fourth quarter growth across disciplines, advertising and media was up 4.4%, CRM Consumer Experience was up 4.2%, Healthcare was up 7.6%, PR increased 1.5%. As we expected, CRM Execution & Support was the only exception, it was down 3.7% in the quarter.","By region, the U.S. was up 2.6%, driven by solid results in media, healthcare and PR. The U.S. benefited from better than expected year-end project spend as well as spending related to the mid-term elections. CRM Execution & Support had negative growth and weighed down the performance in the U.S.","Overall growth in the UK was 2.4%. Media and Healthcare performed very well. Offsetting this growth was a decline in CRM Execution & Support, particularly in field marketing.","Overall growth in our European region was 5.7% led by France, Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic. Germany again had negative growth due to specific management and operational challenges at some of our agencies. We've taken actions to address this performance and expect to see improvements.","Asia-Pacific growth slowed in the quarter to 2.9%. While most of the markets in the region, experienced positive results, the region faced tough comps relative to the prior year. Lastly, Latin America posted growth of 1% in the quarter. Strong results in Mexico were offset by negative growth in Brazil and Colombia.","In 2018, we remain focused on executing our plan to drive efficiencies across our organization, which contributed to the increase in year-over-year margins. This performance was a result of our agency management teams remaining laser-focused on controlling their cost structure, our ongoing Omnicom-wide operational initiatives to leverage our scale in areas such as real estate, accounting and IT, and the benefit from the disposition of lower margin non-core businesses during 2018. Importantly, we've been able to improve our margins while continuing to invest in our talent and our data and our analytic capabilities.","Turning to our cash flow, in 2018, Omnicom generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Approximately $475 million in cash was used for acquisition-related spend during the year. Our plans for the use of free cash flow remains unchanged; dividend, acquisition and share repurchases.","As we recently announced, our Board of Directors increased the Company's quarterly cash dividend to $0.65 per common share. This represents an 8.3% increase in our quarterly dividend. With this increase, our dividend payout ratio is 45%. Lastly, our balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong.","Turning now to our strategy and operations; 2018 was a year of significant accomplishments for Omnicom. We finalized the expansion of our Global Client Leaders Group organization and our practice areas, which have been aligned within our global networks. We continue to realign and optimize our portfolio of agencies through acquisitions and dispositions.","We've made investments in technology, data and analytics, and as I mentioned, we continue to streamline our operations in real estate, accounting and IT. In 2016, we began the formation of practice areas, together with our Global Client Leaders Group, to deliver to clients a single point of access to our network of thousands of industry specials and specific marketing disciplines.","With strong leadership in each of our practice areas, we are now positioned to better grow with existing clients, strengthen our new business efforts, better target our internal investments as well as create more career opportunities for our people. We began with Omnicom Health Group and Omnicom PR Group and now have practice areas in precision marketing and CRM, global advertising, national advertising, brand consultancy, experiential marketing, shopper marketing, media and specialty marketing. Each of these areas has strong leadership who can quickly mobilize our assets to create customized solutions for our clients.","With the ability to create nimble, flexible and integrated agency models, our streamlined structure helped us win some of the biggest new business pitches in 2018, including Ford Creative, Duncan Creative and Volkswagen Creative, which we retained in key markets. We also closed the year with a few major wins. After a long, highly contested review, the U.S. Army selected Omnicom agencies to deliver an integrated offering, managing their marketing and PR activities over the next 10 years.","On the media front, Daimler AG awarded its global media account to Omnicom Media Group. The Group will handle media for all of Daimler's divisions; Mercedes-Benz cars and vans, Daimler trucks and buses, as well as Daimler Financial Services in 40 markets worldwide. A significant part of Omnicom's success is driven by our investments in technology, data and analytics. These investments started over a decade ago with the formation of Annalect.","In 2018, we took another leap forward with the launch of Omni, a first of a kind people-based precision marketing and insights platform. Today, I'm happy to report, many of our agencies have deployed Omni to create, plan and execute personalized customer experiences at scale with some of our largest clients. The platform is also transforming the way our teams work by providing a single view of their client's consumers enabling them to drive precision marketing across Creative, CRM and media. This personalization at scale is providing enormous value to our clients.","As important as the client wins I mentioned earlier, is the way in which we achieve our success. It wasn't about collapsing our agencies into one, but rather investing in our agency brands and connecting them through our practice groups, Global Client leaders and platforms like Omni, which allowed us to leverage our scale in an agile, fluid and diverse way.","The growth of our business in 2018 underscores the distinctive talents of our people and the strength of our agency brands as well as our differentiated structure and service offering. We know our clients today are looking for greater simplicity from their partners as they are demanding award winning creativity alongside deep expertise in technology, data and commerce in a single organization.","A barometer that we use to measure success is the performance of our work in award shows as well as recognition by industry publications. Our performance helps us retain and recruit the best creative talent and blue-chip clients. In addition to winning more than our fair share of Cannes Lions as well as Spikes earlier in 2018, here are the few of the more recent highlights.","Omnicom was named Holding Company of the Year by MediaPost, TBWA was named Global Agency of the Year by Adweek, The Drum's Big Won Rankings of the world's most awarded agencies ranked 10 Omnicom agencies among the top 20 from around the globe, more than any other holding company, and for the second year in a row, BBDO Worldwide, won the most awarded network.","Omnicom's media and creative networks won 75 Agency of the Year titles across four key cities Mumbai, Tokyo, Shanghai and Singapore, during campaigns Asia Agency of the Year Awards. In Europe, PHD, won Eurobest Media Agency of the Year.","While making sure we offer our clients and prospects the latest in advertising and marketing technology, during 2018, we continued to realign and invest in our portfolio of agencies to ensure they are positioned to deliver services in line with our clients' changing needs.","As part of this process, we completed numerous dispositions of companies that were underperforming or no longer aligned with our long-term strategies. In all, we disposed more than 20 companies in 2018.","At the same time, we continue to focus our investment strategy on expanding our service capabilities in high-growth areas, such as CRM and direct marketing, media, healthcare, data and analytics. We acquired several companies in 2018, each of which strategically aligned with one of our practice areas. With these bolt-on acquisitions, we can offer our clients more integrated, end-to-end marketing services.","Before handing the call off to Phil, I'd like to make a final commentary on diversity. Our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce starts at the top. In 2018, we completed the Refreshment process of our Board of Directors.","Omnicom's Board now has 10 Independent Directors, including six women and four African Americans. I'm proud to say, we have one of the most diverse Boards in corporate America. These changes strengthen Omnicom's governance structure and demonstrate our commitment to onboarding exceptional candidates, who bring a wealth of experience and diverse point of view.","In addition, Omniwomen continues to grow organically around the globe and there are many initiatives planned to celebrate women in management positions, leading up to International Women's Day on March 8th.","OPEN Pride, our employee resource group dedicated to Omnicom's LGBTQ community has extended its global reach with 10 chapters across India, China, Philippines, Australia, UK along with U.S. cities, including New York City, Chicago and St. Louis. In addition, new chapters are in development for Mexico City, San Francisco, Barcelona, Auckland and Los Angeles.","It's also worth noting, thanks to our many diversity initiatives, Omnicom now has the most diverse workforce in its 30-year history. It is these hardworking talented people, more than 70,000 worldwide that help Omnicom post another winning year.","Looking forward to 2019, we are optimistic about our prospects and we continue to stay focused on our strategic objectives that have served us well. We continue to hire and develop the best talent in the industry; we will be relentless in pursuing growth by meeting and exceeding our clients' expectation, expanding our service offerings to our existing clients and winning new business.","We will continue to pursue high growth areas and opportunities through internal investments and acquisitions and we will remain vigilant on driving efficiencies throughout our organization. In closing, we are very pleased that our strong financial performance continues to reflect the excellence of our people and agencies. And I thank everyone for their efforts.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the results. Phil?","Philip Angelastro","Thanks, John and good morning. As John just described, the fourth quarter results represented a strong end to Omnicom's year. As is essential in today's business climate, our agencies remain focused on responding to our clients' needs in an ever-changing marketplace, while at the same time, they continue to manage their internal cost structures to efficiently deliver their services. Our business has continued to execute on both objectives. We also continue to see the benefit of our Company-wide efforts to increase our operational efficiency.","Regarding our revenue and starting on Slide 5, for the fourth quarter, we had organic growth of 3.2% or $132 million, as our agencies overall did well to improve upon last year in capturing year-end project spend. FX again negatively impacted revenue, reducing our reported revenue for the quarter by 2% or $83 million.","Regarding acquisitions and dispositions, as we spoke about during our last call, we completed several dispositions during the third quarter, the largest of which was Sellbytel, our European sales support business. We also completed several acquisitions over the past year, including this quarter's acquisition of the Media and Performance Marketing division of UDG, a Strategic Digital Media Group in Germany. The net impact of our acquisition and disposition activities reduced fourth quarter revenue by about $101 million or 2.4%, in line with our expectations.","And lastly, as a reminder, we were required to adopt the FASB's new Revenue Recognition Standard, known as ASC 606, effective with the beginning of 2018. The impact of applying the new revenue recognition standard reduced our reported revenue by approximately $38 million or 0.9% for the quarter. As a result, our revenue in the fourth quarter decreased to a little under $4.1 billion when compared to Q4 of last year. Later on, I will discuss the components of the changes in revenue in more detail.","Turning to Slide 1, our operating profit for the quarter was $627 million, up slightly when compared to Q4 of 2017, while our operating margin of 15.3% represented a 30 basis point increase over last year's fourth quarter. EBITDA was $650 million and our EBITDA margin of 15.9% was also up 30 basis points when compared to last year.","Our ongoing internal initiatives to increase our operational efficiencies, focusing on real estate, back office services, procurement and IT, continue to positively impact our operating income and margin performance as well as the benefits of the restructuring actions we took last quarter. We also benefited from the disposition of several non-strategic, lower margin agencies, which was partially offset by the reduction in margins caused by the negative impact of FX in the quarter.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $53.1 million, up $3.1 million versus last year's fourth quarter figure and down $3.6 million versus the $56.7 million reported in the third quarter of 2018. Gross interest expense in the quarter was up $6.6 million compared to last year's Q4, primarily due to the impact of increased interest rates over the past year, particularly impacting our floating rate swaps, while interest income increased $3.5 million due to an increase in cash held by our treasury centers when compared to a year ago.","When compared with Q3 of this year, gross interest expense in the fourth quarter decreased by $1.1 million, primarily driven by the reduction in our commercial paper activity during the fourth quarter. And interest income increased by $2.5 million over last year, resulting from higher than average cash balances that we typically carry at year-end.","Turning to taxes, our reported effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26.1%, bringing the full year tax rate to 25.6%. The primary driver of the lower effective tax rate year-over-year was the lower U.S. tax rate resulting from the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, which reduced the federal statutory tax rate 21% from 35%. The effective rate for the year was slightly lower than what we previously anticipated for 2018.","Going forward, we anticipate our effective tax rate for 2019 will be 27%, which approximates our actual full year rate 2018 after excluding the following items; tax impact of the repositioning actions taken in Q3, the additional tax expense recorded in Q3 resulting from the provisional amounts originally recorded in Q4 of 2017 in connection with the Tax Act, the successful resolution of foreign tax claims during the first quarter of 2018, and after excluding the impact of the tax benefit realized from share-based compensation items, particularly in Q4, which we cannot predict because it is subject to changes in our share price and the impact of future stock option exercises.","Earnings in our equity method investments was $5.3 million for the quarter upon the strength of the performance of our affiliates in Asia and Europe. The allocation of earnings to minority shareholders in our less than fully-owned subsidiaries decreased by $2.9 million to $30.5 million, primarily a result of our disposition activity and the negative impact of FX since a large number of our less than fully-owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S.","As a result, our net income for the fourth quarter was $399 million. As a reminder in Q4 last year, we recorded a net increase to income tax expense, $106 million related to our preliminary assessment of the impact of the passage of the 2017 Tax Act just before last year-end. Although, net income increased $145 million versus last year's reported net income of $254 million, excluding last year's additional tax charge, net income increased $39 million or 10.7%.","Now turning to Slide 2, net income available for common shareholders for the quarter was $399 million. Our diluted share count for Q4 was 225.6 million, decrease of 2.9% versus Q4 of last year due to the impact of our share repurchase activity over the past 12 months.","As a result, diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.77 per share. That's up $0.68 versus our reported Q4 2017 amount of $1.09 per share and up $0.22 or 14.2% after excluding the impact of the $106 million charge tax reform, which we took in Q4 of last year.","On Slides 3 and 4, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the full year results. As a reminder, in the third quarter, we closed on the disposition of Sellbytel. Along with other dispositions we completed during the third quarter that resulted in a net pre-tax gain of $178 million. In addition, during the third quarter, we recorded charges of $149 million for repositioning actions, primarily resulting from severance and lease terminations.","Lastly, in Q3, we recorded additional tax expense of approximately $29 million, resulting from adjustments of the provisional amounts originally recorded in connection with the 2017 Tax Act. The non-GAAP adjusted results on Slide 22 in the supplemental section of our presentation present our full year results, excluding these items. Since the full-year results, without these items, are in line with our quarterly performance, I will highlight just a few of them.","The reported operating profit for 2018 was $2.13 billion, an increase of 2.4% versus last year, with the resulting operating margin of 14%. And finally, our full year reported EPS was $5.83 per share compared to $4.65 a share in 2017. Excluding the impact during the third quarter of the dispositions, the repositioning actions and tax reform adjustments, 2018's EPS would have been $0.08 lower at $5.75 per share, that's up $0.65 in comparison to 2017's adjusted EPS of $5.10 after excluding the impact of the additional $106 million in tax expense recorded in connection with the Tax Act at the end of 2017.","Returning to the details of our revenue performance in the fourth quarter; on Slide 5, as we discussed in detail during previous calls, this year we adopted ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard and the impact of applying the new revenue recognition standard reduced our reported revenue by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. The impact on EBIT was not material.","Because of the dollar's continued strengthening over the past several months, the FX impact on our reported revenue created headwinds in the fourth quarter. The impact of changes in currency rates decreased reported revenue by 2% or $83 million in revenue for the quarter. And the strengthening again was widespread. On a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, the dollar strengthened against every one of our major foreign currencies except for the Japanese yen. The largest FX movements in the quarter were from the Australian dollar, the Brazilian real, the euro and the UK pound.","As for a projection of the FX impact for 2019, any assumption on how foreign currency rates will move over the next few months let alone the rest of the year, for us is highly speculative. However, as we begin the year, currencies stay where they currently are. Based on our projection, FX could reduce our reported revenues by approximately 2.5% to 3% in the first half of 2019 and 1.5% for the full year.","The impact of our recent acquisitions, net of dispositions, decreased revenue by $101 million in the quarter or 2.4%. As we enter 2019, we expect the impact of acquisitions, net of dispositions completed through year-end will continue to be negative; approximately 3% to 3.5% for the first half of 2019 and 2.5% for the year as we cycle through the Sellbytel and other dispositions from 2018.","Finally, while remaining somewhat mixed geographically and by discipline, organic growth for the fourth quarter was up 3.2%, primarily reflecting the positive effects, client year-end project spending. Geographically, the U.S., European and Asia-Pacific regions had the strongest growth. Regarding our service disciplines, our healthcare agency group had excellent growth this quarter, as did our CRM Consumer Experience agencies as well as our advertising discipline, primarily driven by the strength of our media businesses.","Slide 6 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the second quarter, the split was 57% for advertising and 43% for marketing services. As for the organic growth by discipline, our advertising discipline was up 4.4%. Media continues to pace the disciplines organic growth and while our global advertising agencies continue to experience mixed performance, our national advertising agencies performed quite well this quarter.","CRM Consumer Experience was up 4.2% organically with our precision marketing agencies leading the way in that category. CRM Execution & Support was down 3.7% this quarter as we again saw sluggish performance, particularly domestically from certain businesses in that discipline. PR was up 1.5% with the strongest performances coming from our domestic agencies, which included a small year-over-year benefit from work associated with the mid-term elections. Lastly, healthcare was up 7.6%. As has been the case recently, the disciplines strong performance was broad-based across all regions.","On Slide 7, which details the regional mix of our business, you can see during the quarter, the split was 52% in the U.S., 3% for the rest of North America, 9% in the UK, 19% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, 3% for Latin America and the balance from the Middle East and African markets.","Turning to the details of our performance by region, on Slide 8. Organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter in the U.S. was 2.6%, led by our advertising and media, healthcare and PR agencies with our CRM Execution & Support agencies lagging. After a negative third quarter, our UK businesses rebounded with positive organic growth of 2.4% led by our healthcare and media agencies. The rest of Europe was up 5.7% organically in the quarter.","In our Europe markets, France, Italy and Spain, continued to turn in strong performances across disciplines this quarter while Germany again underperformed. Organic growth in Europe outside the Eurozone was positive as well. Organic growth in the Asia Pacific region was 2.9% with positive growth in all disciplines. Geographically, we saw solid performances from our agencies in Greater China, India and New Zealand this quarter and Japan returned to positive growth.","Latin America had organic growth of 1% in the quarter. The ongoing macroeconomic issues in Brazil continue to impact our businesses in the marketplace. For the quarter, they were down again at just over 1%. Offsetting Brazil, we continue to see positive performance elsewhere in the region, particularly from our agencies in Mexico. The Middle East and Africa, which was our smallest region was up 4.2% for the quarter.","Turning to Slide 9, we present our mix of revenue by our client's industry sector. In comparing the full-year revenue for 2018 to 2017, you can see there were some minor shifts in distribution of our client revenue by industry, but nothing particularly noteworthy.","Turning to our cash flow performance, on Slide 10, you can see that we generated $1.64 billion of free cash flow during the year, including a positive effect from changes in working capital as well as the proceeds of $308 million from the disposition of businesses, which primarily occurred in the third quarter.","As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 11, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $549 million, up due to the 5% increase in our quarterly dividend that was effective with the January 2018 payment, partially offset by the reduction in share count year-over-year, resulting from our repurchase activity.","Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders were $135 million, up $33 million year-on-year. Capital expenditures increased $40 million to $196 million as we continue our real estate reconfiguration efforts to increase operational efficiency.","Acquisitions including earn-out payments were $477 million, up $392 million due to an increase in acquisition activity in 2018 as compared to the prior year. And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $568 million, roughly the same as in 2017. Excluding the $308 million of proceeds from our dispositions during the year, we outspent our free cash flow by about $283 million this year, primarily driven by our acquisition activity in 2018.","Turning to Slide 12, regarding our capital structure at the end of the year, our total debt is down $33 million over the past year at just under $4.9 billion. Our net debt position at the end of the year was $1.23 billion, up $105 million compared to December 31 of 2017.","The increase was principally due to the overspend of our free cash flow of $283 million and the negative impact of FX on our cash balances at year-end, which totaled approximately $200 million. Partially offsetting these, was the positive change in operating capital of approximately $80 million and the cash proceeds received from the sale of subsidiaries during the year of $308 million.","As for our debt ratios, they remain solid. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.0x and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.5x, both consistent with the ratios from this time last year. While our interest coverage ratio was 9.9x, down a little over the past year due to the increase in interest expense, it remains very strong.","On Slide 13, you can see, we continue to manage and build the Company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio, 29.6%, while our return on equity was 51.4%. As we anticipated, both ratios were positively impacted this year by the lower U.S. corporate tax rates enacted at the end of 2017.","And finally on Slide 15, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10 years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2009 through 2018, which totaled $10.3 billion and the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and net share repurchases, some of which during the same period was $10.7 billion. This resulted in a cumulative payout ratio of 104% over the last decade.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included several other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We go to the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you so much. Just a couple of questions if I may. First, I guess, how should we think broadly about organic growth in 2019? And can we continue to see this improvement in the U.S.? And then just a second question really is on the CRM execution business, which remains weak. I think you highlighted field marketing was particularly soft. I guess, are you planning to add any other divestitures similar to the ones we saw in Q3? Thank you.","John Wren","Good morning, Alexia. This is John. In terms of organic growth at this point, we are \u2013 what will start tomorrow is the process of sitting down with our companies and going through their final profit plans for 2019. So at this point, if I was making a prediction, I'd say organic growth is probably going to come in somewhere between 2% and 3%. I think it's similar to what we said in the past.","Some of the wins that we've received, to your second question of domestic growth, I'm optimistic. Some of the wins that we had in the fourth quarter of 2018, specifically Ford and the U.S. Army, they're not going to make too much of a contribution, I don't think in the first quarter and half of this year, but after that, they should start to contribute rather significantly to our performance as domestically and in other parts of the world. I don't know, Phil, you want to add?","Philip Angelastro","Yes. Just to clarify, I think the 2% to 3%, which was our internal target last year is for the year. So that's where we're seeing 2019. At the moment, we don't have the best visibility given it's early February, in terms of what the year is going to shake out to be and certainly a lot of things can change between now and the balance of the year. But I think that's our current set of expectations.","John Wren","I can promise you, if we can do better, we will. With respect to your other question about CRM execution, we are constantly going through \u2013 we did do a lot of disposals during the year, but consistent with, I think what we've been telling the shareholders, we've been looking at our portfolio of companies and those that we don't think will contribute to our growth as we look forward, where we are considering disposal. We did quite a bit of work in the third quarter and earlier in the year that review constantly goes on, and as we will continue to go on, especially as we go through the next three or four weeks worth of proper planning for 2019.","Alexia Quadrani","And then just a follow-up if I may on your earlier comment, I don't want to nitpick too much about organic growth in any one quarter because I know it's a small dollar amount that makes a change, but just maybe a broader comment about the Q4 performance. You mentioned project business in Q4 came through well, which was a benefit for the better U.S. organic growth in Q4. But did you get a sense of sort of the underlying feel of the business also showed some improvement or am I trying to split hairs here that is too difficult to answer?","John Wren","Well, you might be trying to split hairs a little bit. As I think, we've said rather consistently, I know, I have for the last 20 years, when we get to the fourth quarter, there is a lot of activities that go on. There are a lot of budgets, which clients haven\u2019t spent that they accelerate activities on. There are a lot of opportunities to sell additional products, which motivates clients to do so. And then there are some clients who try to hold back that spending to increase their P&Ls. This year, I think if I'm remembering correctly, 18 of the last 20 years, the fourth quarter has come through with that project spending. I think those one or two years during the great recession.","Philip Angelastro","Yes, last year was realistically, a little bit easier for the comp and we've had 10 years before, because we didn't do as well frankly in picking up that project spend as we did this year.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Craig Huber","Yes. Good morning. I have three questions. My first one, just a follow-on to Alexia. Your organic outlook this year of 2% to 3%, what is your preliminary thought on margins for the year? Flat or what are you thinking right now, please?","John Wren","Phil and I maybe thinking differently. Again, we haven't finished our profit planning. At this point, if I had to make a prediction, I'd say, I'm looking at them to be flat. The primary headwind we have in margins is the strength of the U.S. dollar. We more or less predict for you what the impacts are going to be on the topline and we tell you that, but we don't predict for you what the impact is going to be on the EBIT line and that's always \u2013 that always create some pressure. So right now, I'd say margins should be flat.","Philip Angelastro","Yes. I mean, I wouldn't disagree. I think, we're certainly going to be working hard, yield a different answer and yield some improvement. But we do expect, let's say, we do expect to achieve some benefits from our continued operational efficiency efforts. We do expect some improvement from a change in mix achieved by some of the dispositions we did in 2018, businesses which are in balance little bit lower margin than our average.","But FX in the fourth quarter, which was negative 2% on revenue for the first time in quite some time, did have a headwind on our margins in the fourth quarter. And we expect FX, certainly in the first half and for the year in 2019, will likely be much more of a headwind. How that will shake out our margins is tough to tell depending on where those FX movements happen.","Craig Huber","And my second question is net new business wins in the fourth quarter, what was that number please?","John Wren","Phil, you know it?","Philip Angelastro","Yes, it was a little over $1.1 billion.","Craig Huber","Okay, great. And then my last question, your performance obviously for the last year was much better than your two large European peers, although it wasn't as strong as it's been historically. And I'm just curious, John, it's been nowhere near nominal GDP growth per se. What would you say, John, is the three biggest factors in your mind that held it back to up 2.6% for the year and maybe what your outlook is for each of those factors for this new year? Has anything significantly changed on each of those three? Thank you.","John Wren","I think that the industry itself has been going through some changes in terms of the way the acceleration of digital and how that gets you rather than traditional forms of media. Some of the portfolio companies that we've had, which always contributed EBIT, especially in the areas of CRM Execution businesses like field marketing and other things, companies like Amazon and online delivery, eliminated the need for the same type of activity that has happened on a retail level, that's happened in the past. So it's been the last \u2013 I'd say two years have been years of transition.","When we look at our portfolio, when we look at the companies that we believe will contribute to our growth going forward, we're looking at those factors and other changes in technology, which are going to impact the services that we've traditionally provided. And so far we've been able to do a pretty good job I think of identifying those areas and taking action on them where we can still get value where other people still have interest in those areas. So I think that's way down a bit in terms of some of the growth.","The other thing that sitting and running a company, you don't mind when your competitors are weak, you really don't like it when your competitors are wounded because they tend to do things that they wouldn't do if they were simply weak and so it's been a rather competitive environment the last six months or so.","Craig Huber","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we have a question from the line of Julien Roch with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julien Roch","Yes, hi there. My first question is, can we have the impact of Accuen on organic in Q4? The second question is I feel several times you said that disposition had a positive impact on margin, FX had a negative impact on margin and your cost as well had a positive impact on margin. So could you break down the margin increase in 2018 between those three things?","And then the last question is, in Q3, you kind of offset your capital gain of $178 million by a provision for restructuring of $149 million. Well, I assume that's mostly a provision. How much of that provision did you use in Q4? Thank you.","Philip Angelastro","Sure. While I'm answering the first two, we need to get the answer on the third number, but that will be in our 10-K filing. So on the first two, I think, well the Accuen number was $6 million growth in the fourth quarter and it basically was largely in the U.S.","On the margin front, I can tell you, FX in the fourth quarter was a negative headwind of about little over 20 basis points. It's hard to split out and we don't, what was the exact impact of our operational efficiencies and what was the exact impact of the dispositions, but FX for the first time was negative in, I'm not sure I recall 20 basis points or so a meaningful difference, but I think some of the listener certainly are interested in that number. So that was that rough estimate.","And then on \u2013 can you just give me a minute on the restructuring front, I think actually, I'm going to have to give you that offline Julien, because \u2013 we have the number, but I want to make sure I answer your question directly. So we can give you some clarity on that offline.","Julien Roch","Okay? Sure. Thank you very much.","John Wren","Sure.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Daniel Salmon","Good morning, everyone. John, you've done a ton of work over the last couple years continuing with divestitures and changing your portfolio of assets, you've done the reorganization around practice groups, when you look across your base of business. I'm curious how do you think it rolls up into exposure by vertical \u2013 by client vertical, do you think about it that way at all looking to have maybe exposure to verticals with better secular growth over the long-term?","And then, just related to that is sort of maybe mix of your largest clients versus how important it is to you to engage some of the more up and coming innovator brands maybe what we call the direct to consumer brands, more broadly. We would love to hear some more thoughts on that.","And then, Phil, just quickly M&A was obviously considerably higher this year versus 2017. Maybe that's you also outspent free cash flow. Would you say 2018 is more reflective of what you would consider a quote unquote, \"normal year\" in that 2017 was unusually conservative and how we think about that to frame your thinking on your uses of free cash flow this year coming up? Thanks.","John Wren","A couple of questions there, I think if you look at the verticals, I think it's Slide 10, so I referred to it earlier, kind of give you an indication of the industry sectors that we service. Since the formation of Omnicom, excuse me, it's Slide 9, since the formation in Omnicom, we've always been focused on serving one, blue-chip clients, two, globally not concentrated in any one area or in any one industry and I think if you look at this slide, plus we've provided it in the past, if you put a few of these years not only 2018 and 2017 together, you'll see that that's been the case for quite a while. So that's in one instance.","If you take a look at our top 25 clients, our matrix area covers up to 100 of our top clients now, but just the top 25, it represents just some of the formula $4 billion of our revenue and we service them in many, many areas and it's a concentration \u2013 it's not a concentration of any particular industry, hash tag, there is auto, there is Pharma, there is financial services, it goes across the Board, very consistent with let's depicted on Slide 9.","In those areas where we've been able to do that, during the year those same clients contributed about 4% growth to our overall organic growth for the year. So we are proving that as we have these practice areas; number one, focusing on skills and crafts the clients need, plus a matrix system of practice areas where we bring everybody servicing that client together, we're able to identify more quickly, needs that clients have and adjust our portfolio and services as quickly as we possibly can.","So it's all moving again it's been going on for close to three years, but we are very satisfied with the progress that we're making. We think it will contribute to our progress going forward.","Philip Angelastro","On the M&A question, I think it's hard to say what 2019 is going to be, because we don't put together internal target with a dollar amount for our targeted M&A spend and then set our M&A focus and network as off to find deals to meet that target, end up doing deals that you otherwise probably would have been better off not doing, but you might have met the target. So we don't plan to change that approach.","I think our preference would be to do more M&A similar to what we accomplished in 2018, more accretive deals if they're available, if they have the right strategic and cultural fit. We don't want to do more than less. So we prefer to do more deals like we did in 2018 as opposed to a pretty low level in 2017, but it's hard to predict.","I mean we've got a number of them in the pipeline that we've been working on and continue to work on. Some of them end up having a long cycle of discussions. Some of them we don't ultimately get close. So it's hard to predict, but we would certainly prefer to look more like what we accomplished in 2018 and 2017.","Daniel Salmon","Great. Thank you, both. Very helpful.","John Wren","Sure.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Timothy Nollen","Good morning. Thanks. Just like \u2013 just one question like to follow up on the outlook for 2019. If you could maybe give us a little bit of color on how clients are approaching spending this year, just in general terms given some big macro issues such as possible slowdowns in China and Brexit risk and so on. Just kind of how are clients thinking about ending this year versus other years and if it's possible to break down kind of an underlying client spending impact on the 2% to 3% versus new business flowing in place?","John Wren","The clients that I've spoken to and we'll get greater insight as we talk to some of our network heads over the course of next 10 days, they are cognizant of the fact that there is a lot of change going on in the world. These are Brexit, you got China slowing down, is the Fed going to raise interest rates, is it going to stay on hold. There's quite a number of factors.","Having said that, I believe I'm speaking for most of our clients and they know that they're in the business of selling products and growing their top lines. So they're going to continue to do whatever activities are necessary to accomplish those tasks. So there's no fear \u2013 I don't get a sense of fear. I don't get a sense of this is going to be \u2013 everything is fine and there are no geopolitical or other risks out there. It's just going to be another year, similar to the ones we've had in I think the last two. And your second question, I think I missed.","Timothy Nollen","Yeah, if you could just help us understand how much of the 2% or 3% preliminary outlook is just underlying client ongoing spending versus inflow of new business, because you had some nice wins toward the end of the year?","Philip Angelastro","Yes. At this point in the year, we don't calculate that. Typically what makes up our organic growth is growth from existing clients, new business wins and losses that we might have. It's been net of those. Yes, it isn't a single number and it isn't that easy to kind of capture it. From a definition perspective it might down pretty straightforward and simple, but when you collect the data at the detail level and roll it up that there's quite a bit of judgment in terms of how those things fall into each of those buckets. So we don't have that kind of information readily available this morning.","Timothy Nollen","Okay, sure. Thanks a lot.","John Wren","I think the market is about to open. We have time for one more call, operator.","Operator","Very good. It\u2019s the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Bazinet","I just had a quick question. You were very kind to talk about the headwind next year, acquisitions and net of dispositions on the topline, to talk about those disposed assets also having lower margins. I just wondered if the disposed assets also had slower growth and might sort of help your organic growth or maybe indeed they were faster growing, it might be a headwind, but any color on the impact your organic growth would be helpful from the dispositions.","John Wren","Personally, I'm not anticipating it is having a significant, statistically measurable type of impact on our overall performance in terms of organic growth. What we were doing, the reason we got paid value I think for the companies that we did dispose off was because of we were projecting out several years and saying that unless we became tremendously larger in these particular areas, we probably wouldn't be able to sustain the growth that we had. And so therefore, we made a decision that somebody else could do a better job with those assets and that's why we got rid of them. So I don't have that calculation for you.","Philip Angelastro","Yes, I think we did that calculation in Q3, but it's not one that we've kind of baked into our internal processes and systems, because we typically try not to carve out all the bad stuff, leaving all the good stuff. But I think it's safe to say that as a portfolio, as we look at 2019, the businesses we disposed of in 2018 were not growing faster than our overall organic growth profile in 2018 for the rest of the business, exactly how much from a dollars or percentage perspective by quarter, we don't think the numbers are going to be that meaningful and we don't have them at hand.","Jason Bazinet","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you very much.","John Wren","Sure. Okay, well thank you everybody for joining the call and we'll talk to you again soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to now introduce you to your host for today\u2019s conference call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Shub Mukherjee. Please go ahead.","Shub Mukherjee","Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. On the call with me today is John Wren, President and Chief Executive Officer and Phil Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer.","We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release we have posted on our website at www.omnicomgroup.com website, both our press release and the presentation covering the information that we will be reviewing this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.","Before we start, I have been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our Investor Presentation and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially.","I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation material. We are going to begin this morning\u2019s call with an overview of our business from John Wren. Then Phil Angelastro will review our financial results. And then we will open up the line to your questions.","John Wren","Thank you, Shub. Thank you for joining us. Good morning. I am pleased to speak to you about our fourth quarter and the full year 2014 business results. As you have seen in our press release, Omnicom had a solid fourth quarter with organic growth of 5.9% giving us strong finish to the year.","Before I discuss our results in detail, I want to reflect upon a number of factors that impact Omnicom, our clients and their consumers in countries where they operate. First, from a macroeconomic perspective, recent declines in oil and commodity prices are helping the consumer and many industries and countries. At this point, the U.S. economy looks to be the biggest beneficiary of these changes with the decline in oil prices likely being additive to U.S. GDP in 2015.","When you move from the U.S. to the global economy, we are seeing a divergence for the first time in central bank policies and actions. Central banks from Australia to Europe, Canada have been lowering borrowing cost to try to kick start growth in their economy. As a result, their currencies have declined versus the U.S. dollar. At Omnicom, a little over 46% of our revenues are generated outside the United States. The significant change in exchange rates resulted in a 3.1% reduction in our revenue in the fourth quarter and will impact our reported results in 2015. At the same time, it\u2019s important to point out that most of our non-U.S. operations are naturally hedged as both revenue and expenses are in the same currency. Both Phil and I will discuss the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in more detail later in the call.","From an industry perspective, we are undergoing a major transformation as new digital tools and platforms emerge with media and technology evolving at an astonishing pace. In 2014, digital ad spend worldwide exceeded $137 billion, a 15% increase. We expect that shift to digital will only accelerate over the next 5 years. There are also changes at Omnicom in 2014. In May, we made a mutual decision with Publicis to terminate our proposed merger, which had been announced in July 2013. And later in the third quarter, we made leadership changes in top positions at Omnicom corporate and the TBWA network. Given these macro industry and company events, I am delighted with the results we report this morning. Our performance in this environment says a lot about the strength of our culture, the quality of our people and the depth of our leadership and governance.","Let me now turn to our revenue performance by region. In the fourth quarter, North America grew 8.3% driven by the continued strong performance of our media business as well as solid results from public relations and our specialty healthcare business. In the UK, our agencies continued to perform very well with revenue up 6.2% in the quarter. On the continent, overall growth was 1.2%. More specifically, the euro currency markets were flat. Germany was positive, while France and the Netherlands continued to drag on the region. We are hopeful that the latest central bank actions combined with structural reforms will lead to stability and ultimately economic growth.","Growth in the rest of the region was relatively strong led by Sweden and Turkey and Russia was up despite economic turbulence. Latin America was down slightly in the quarter due to the loss of government accounts in Chile in mid 2014. Asia\u2019s growth was up 3.2%, with key contributors this quarter being India and Singapore. We also had strong growth throughout the Middle East. As promised, our margins for the quarter were on plan. This result was achieved despite negative margin pressures due to the currency declines I discussed earlier. For the full year 2014, Omnicom\u2019s worldwide organic growth was 5.7%. Our total revenue increased to $15.3 billion and our earnings per share was $4.23, a 10.2% increase from 2013 after excluding related costs to the proposed Omnicom Publicis merger.","Turning to our cash flow and return on capital, in 2014, we generated just shy of $1.6 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $125 million year-over-year. We returned approximately $1.5 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases. As you may recall, post the termination of the proposed Publicis Omnicom merger, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.50 per share and we resumed our share repurchase program. Looking forward, our practice for use of cash, dividend, acquisitions and share repurchases remains unchanged as does our commitment to the strong balance sheet and then maintaining our credit rating.","As we move into 2015, given the current environment we remain focused on the things we can control. Our management teams are dedicated to servicing their client needs, attracting and retaining the best talent, while at the same time being laser focused on managing costs. I want to thank our people, our clients and all of our stakeholders for their contributions to our fourth quarter and for the full year results for 2014. Our strong and consistent performance, are a testament to the fact that Omnicom\u2019s long-term strategies are working. As I have said before we are attracting, retaining and developing top talent, expanding our capabilities in both new markets and new service areas, building our digital data and analytical capabilities by investing in our agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies and delivering big ideas based upon meaningful consumer insights across all of the channels that we operate. Our ability to stay on top or ahead of the change simply puts we have the best talent in the business which is why we win more than our fair share of the industry\u2019s recognition awards and business.","Last quarter Omnicom agencies continued their tradition of being most creatively awarded company in the world. Let me just mention a few of the highlights. BBDO was named most awarded agency network in the world in 2014 by the Gunn Report for the ninth consecutive year. DDB was the second most awarded network. OMD was named global media agency of the year by Adweek. Advertising Age honored Adam&Eve DDB as international agency of the year. And Alma DDB won multicultural agency of the year. At the Campaign Asia-Pacific Agency of the year award, TBWA and DDB won creative agencies for the year in Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Philippines and Indonesia. And there were many others. I want to congratulate all of our people and agencies for their outstanding performance and creativity in 2014.","As I mentioned earlier and as you all know, our industry is becoming increasingly complex and our clients are looking to us for ways to navigate this rapidly changing landscape. At Omnicom we are continually expanding our capabilities to meet our clients\u2019 needs. Technology is providing tools and we are providing the brain to deliver actionable consumer insights, develop better ways to target consumers and then reaching them across many different disciplines in media to give Omnicom clients the best possible solution. Our internal investments in people, our technology partnerships and our acquisitions have allowed us to expand our company and participate in these rapidly growing areas. 2014 more than any year I can remember was the year that we truly saw the convergence of technology creativity and media changed the way our agencies operate.","Several events come to mind, as part of our partnership deals with tech companies our creative talent is working side by side with engineers from Facebook, Google, Instagram, Twitter and others. And the net result is increasing innovative solutions to our clients. As an example Lowe\u2019s, which was among the first to use Vines as a marketing tool with its award-winning Fix in Six campaign launched it\u2019s Next Generation of Vines, using Tap Thru and HyperMade. These are new, innovative technologies that deliver unique and differentiated content to consumers. The campaign for Lowe\u2019s is a fully integrated effort together our agencies and tech partners did everything from creative and targeting the media placement and analytics.","We are seeing this trend to play out as we broaden our reach and functionality of Annalect Data Management Platform, an investment we began in 2013. As an example data analysts from Annalect are part of the creative and digital teams servicing multiple clients. These teams are leveraging data and analytics to help inform planning and creative to deliver relevant content to optimize campaign with the real-time insights. The result is much greater precision delivering the right message to the right audience at the right time and on the right device.","Finally, our acquisitions are also supplementing our expansion into rapidly growing areas. Earlier this month, we acquired TLGG, a strategic consulting and digital agency in Germany. Late in 2014, we have purchased Washington-based DDC Advocacy, an innovative CRM agency for clients in the Public Affairs space. And Omnicom\u2019s DAS took full ownership of Critical Mass, a leading global digital shop.","In 2015, we continue to focus our acquisition efforts in key markets and areas of growth, including media, data and analytics, CRM, production and healthcare. Looking back on a year of unprecedented changes, Omnicom continues to be an industry leader embracing new technologies, delivering outstanding creativity for our clients and their brands and generating an exceptional total return to shareholders. I want to recognize a more than 70,000 people for bringing their A games to our clients everyday.","I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the numbers.","Phil Angelastro","Thank you, John and good morning. As John said, our operating companies have continued to perform very well delivering against their operating and strategic objectives and maintaining their focus on meeting the needs of their clients. As a result of the excellent performance of our agencies, revenue for the quarter came in at just about $4.2 billion, up 3.4%. The year-over-year increase was driven by continued strong organic growth of 5.9%, this despite a considerable FX headwind this quarter of 3.1%. FX was negative this quarter across virtually every currency we operate in. I will discuss our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes.","Turning to the figures below revenue, a quick reminder, as you know, we terminated the merger this past May. During the fourth quarter of \u201813, we incurred $13.3 million of merger-related costs. These costs are included in our GAAP results for 2013. In discussing our performance for the quarter, my comments will compare the current quarter to last year\u2019s Q4 results excluding the impact of the merger-related expenses. You can find this non-GAAP presentation in the supplemental financial information section on Slides 19 through 24.","Turning to Slide 19, our EBITDA for the quarter increased to $609 million from $589 million, an increase of 3.5% compared to Q4 last year. The resulting EBITDA margin for the quarter was 14.5% unchanged versus Q4 last year. As said previously, the sharp decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar of virtually all currencies we operated in negatively impacted our revenues across all of our international operations, because the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in same local currencies as our revenues, the negative impact of FX on our margins in the quarter was manageable. Despite this FX headwind, we continue to see a positive impact from our efforts to drive efficiencies throughout our organization and our agency and to control our cost. Operating income or EBIT performed similarly to EBITDA increasing $15 million or 2.6% to $579 million. And our operating margin of 13.8% was down slightly versus Q4 2013 due to the increase in amortization on our intangible assets.","Now, turning to the items below operating income, net interest expense for the quarter is $30 million, down $1.4 million from the third quarter and down $9.8 million year-over-year. As compared to Q3 while we incurred additional interest expense related to the $750 million of 10-year senior notes that we issued early in the fourth quarter, the increase was effectively offset by the impact of the fixed to floating interest rate swaps we entered into late in the third quarter related to our 2020 senior notes. Net interest expense was also reduced by additional interest income earned by our international treasury centers as a result of higher than average cash balances in Q4 as compared to Q3. Versus last year, net interest expense was down $9.8 million in the quarter. This was primarily due to the positive impact of the interest rate swaps we entered into over the past year in mid Q2 and late Q3, net of the additional interest expense related to the new issuance of senior notes in Q4 of 2014 plus benefits from our cash management efforts in the form of increased interest income earned by our international treasury centers.","Our quarterly tax rate of 33.2% is in line with our normal expectations. Earnings from our affiliates were up slightly in the quarter to $5.7 million and the allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders and our less than fully owned subsidiaries increased $3.4 million to $43.4 million as a result of improved performance at several of our existing subsidiaries that have local minority owners as well as at several of our new acquisitions. As a result, net income was $329.5 million, that\u2019s an increase of $15.7 million or 5% versus Q4 last year and an increase of 9.7% compared to the 2013 reported amount.","Now, turning to Page 21, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $5.6 million of net income to participating securities, which for us or the unvested restricted shares held by our employees, was $323.9 million, an increase of 5.7% versus Q4 last year. You can also see our diluted share count for the quarter was $249.9 million, which is down 4.1% versus last year as a result of the resumption of our share buyback program during the second quarter of 2014. Given our overall strong performance in the quarter, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.30, an increase of $0.12 or 10.2% versus Q4 2013 or up $0.17 and 15% compared to the 2013 reported amount.","On Slides 22 through 24, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the full year. To save some time, I will just give you a few highlights. Full year revenue was up 5% driven predominantly by organic growth of 5.7% with FX going from positive for the first nine months of the year to slightly negative for the year and net acquisitions turning from negative for the first nine months of the year to slightly positive for the year. EBITDA increased 4.3% to $2.05 billion, while our full year EBITDA margin was 13.4%, down about 10 basis points versus last year. As a reminder, the 2014 EBITDA amount include $8.8 million from merger-related costs incurred earlier in the year.","Our effective tax rate for the year was 32.8% slightly below our operating rate of 33.2%, reflecting the impact of the tax benefit we recognized upon termination of the merger in the second quarter. The benefit related to merger expenses recognized in 2013 which are required to be capitalized for tax purposes at that time. Net income for the year was $1.1 billion, up 7.6% over 2013 and our full year diluted EPS was $4.24 per share, up $0.40 versus 2013 non-GAAP amount of $3.84 and up $0.53 versus our reported 2013 amount of $3.71. Excluding the impact of merger expenses and the related tax benefits from both years, full year diluted EPS for 2014 was $4.23 per share, up 10.2% versus 2013 diluted EPS of $3.84.","Turning back to Slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. First, with regard to FX on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened against every one of our major currencies, most notably the euro as well as the Australian and Canadian dollars, the real, the ruble and the yen. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $129 million or 3.1%. Looking ahead, considering the recent steep decline in the value of all major currencies against the dollar in a relative short period of time, these FX rates for 2015 stay where they are. FX could have a negative impact on our revenues approximately 5.5% during the first quarter of 2015 and approximately 5% for the year. Given it is only early February, it\u2019s hard to predict what will happen to FX rate for the balance of the year.","Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $26 million driven by our recent acquisitions in Brazil, Chile, Germany, Turkey, and the UK as well as here in the U.S. With the transactions that we have completed through December 31, we expect acquisitions net of dispositions to add about 50 basis points to 60 basis points to revenue in the first quarter and the year.","And finally, organic growth was positive $240 million or 5.9% for the quarter. It was another strong quarter with positive organic growth across all of our markets, with the exception being France, Italy, the Netherlands, Japan and South Korea and the smaller markets of Latin America. The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued excellent performance across our media businesses driven by the continuing expansion of our media offerings and new business wins, continuing strength domestically and in the UK with the PR and specialty businesses turning in solid performances this quarter.","In addition to the strong performance in the U.S. and the UK, our agencies in the emerging markets continue to perform very well. This quarter we had excellent performances in India, Mexico and the UAE. In the euro markets, overall organic growth was basically flat. Germany and Spain were again positive as they have been for several quarters, while the French and Dutch markets are still struggling. And we continue to see generally good performance across our businesses in our other markets, including Brazil, China, India and our non-euro markets in Europe, although the rate of growth continues to be somewhat uneven market by market.","Slide 8 covers our full year revenue performance, which is basically in line with this quarter\u2019s results, except for FX, which was slightly positive for the first nine months before turning slightly negative for the year. On Slides 9 and 10 we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split was 57% for North America, 10% for the UK, 18% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia-Pacific, 3% for Latin America and 2% for Africa and the Middle East.","Turning to the details on Slide 10, in North America, we had organic revenue growth of 8.3% again primarily driven this quarter by the performance of our media businesses, healthcare and PR businesses. The UK once again had a very strong quarter and has been consistently positive organically for the last two years. The rest of Europe was up 1.2% led by a solid performance in Germany, continuing strong performance in Spain and our other non-euro markets in Europe. On the downside, France and Netherlands continue to struggle.","Asia-Pacific was up 3.2%. We had strong performances across the region with India and Singapore leading the way with double-digit growth. China also had a solid quarter, especially in light of a difficult comp versus Q4 of 2013 while Japan and South Korea also facing difficult comps versus Q4 of 2013 experienced softness in the quarter. Latin America overall was down slightly. The positive performance in Brazil also facing a difficult comp versus Q4 of last year and Mexico was offset by weakness and Chile related to the loss of the significant decline in that market, which will continue to cycle into the first half of next year. In Africa and the Middle East regions, although off a small base was up 14% led by a very strong quarter from our businesses in the UAE.","Slide 11 shows our mix of business for the quarter, which again was split about evenly between advertising and marketing services. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 8.5% primarily driven by the excellent performance of our media businesses and marketing services overall was up 3.4%. Within marketing services, CRM coming off a robust performance in Q4 of 2013 was up 1%. The performance was mixed by business and discipline in Q4. Our events in fuel marketing businesses had a challenging quarter, while the direct marketing sales promotion and research businesses had strong performances with trends across several markets. Public relations, was up 8.5% relative to a challenging Q4 2013 and reflecting strength in the U.S. and the UK in 2014. Specialty communications was up about 9.4% on the strength of our healthcare businesses in the U.S. and the UK partially offset by some weakness in Japan.","On Slide 12, we present our mix of business by industry sector, keeping in mind these year-to-date figures, total growth, not just organic growth. As you can see, we are up in almost all categories. The larger changes were in our telecom and other industries group. Telecom continues to be impacted by the loss of Blackberry and within other, we benefited from new business wins and project spending from our services clients.","Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 13, in 2014, we generated $1.58 billion of free cash flow, including changes in working capital, an increase of 8.6% versus 2013. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 14, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $468 million, up significantly from last year. As a reminder in 2013, we only made three dividend payments, because we paid our normal Q1 dividend in the fourth quarter of 2012. Additionally, we increased our quarterly dividend earlier this year. Dividends paid to our non-controlling interest shareholders totaled $111 million.","Capital expenditures were $213 million, which was in line with our expectations for the year. Acquisitions including earn-out payments net of proceeds received from the sale of investments totaled $207 million and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $994 million. Since we restarted our share repurchase program in mid-May post the termination of the merger, we have purchased about 14.3 million shares net. As a result, we outspent our free cash flow by about $410 million for the year.","Turning to Slide 15 focusing first on our capital structure, as you maybe aware, we issued $750 million in 10-year senior notes, a 3.65% during the fourth quarter. As a result, our total debt increased to $4.6 billion as of December 31 and our leverage approximates our historic norms. And our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.2 million. The increase in our net debt of $869 million over the past year was driven primarily by the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow as we just discussed as well as the negative impact of FX translations on our cash balance at December 31, 2014 of approximately $275 million. In spite of the increase in our debt, our ratios remain very strong. Our total debt to EBITDA was two times and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was one time. And due to both the decrease in our interest expense and the increase in EBITDA, our interest coverage ratio improved to 12.6 times.","Turning to Slide 16, we continue to successfully build the company through a combination of prudently priced acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased 20.3% and return on equity increased 34.3%.","And finally on Slide 17, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from fiscal 2004 through 2014, which totaled $10 billion. And the bar show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases to some of which during the same period totaled $10.8 billion for cumulative payout ratio of 108%.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included number of other supplemental slides on the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we are going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani representing JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. My first question is just on the strong growth you saw the organic growth picks in the U.S. in the quarter, is there anyway you can give us the sense about how much contributions the programmatic was to that growth in the quarter. And then I have a follow-up question really about the FX headwinds you are going to be seeing in 2000 \u2013 or continue to be seeing in 2015, do you think it\u2019s possible to still maintain your margins in \u201815 with that headwind maybe from the natural leverage you get from the healthy organic growth you are seeing? Thanks.","John Wren","Good morning, we were cycling on our programmatic business during the fourth quarter. And I believe the contribution to the gross in the quarter was about $20 million. Your second question on FX, at this point we are hoping that FX moderates as we go through the year. And looking at the first quarter and we have looked at in detail we believe we can maintain the margins in the first quarter. As Phil was speaking, I am looking at the news of a little bit and seeing Egypt came out this morning, every central bank seems to do something new everyday. So I can give you the assurance through the first quarter.","Alexia Quadrani","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the client loss in Latin America, I think you mentioned which created difficult performance in that quarter, do you know if that was the one-time sort of project or is that something that will be a headwind for the whole year?","John Wren","That was a project \u2013 that was the client in Chile. We expect in the first half of \u201915, that\u2019s going to have a bit of a headwind as we cycle on it. It started kind of the end of the second quarter of \u201914, so there will be a little bit of negative impact in showing that beginning in next year.","Alexia Quadrani","Okay. Thank you very much.","John Wren","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Bank","Hey, thanks very much. Actually a little bit of a follow-up to the first question on the margin target, I guess which realizing the difficulty of reading the tea leaves in a macro landscape that\u2019s hugely volatile and central banks doing all kinds of conflicting things, but can you give us a broad sense of what the organic top line range needs to be in order for you to maintain your current level of margins?","John Wren","I will let Phil take a shot of this and then I will add.","Phil Angelastro","Yes. I mean I am not sure that we \u2013 I am not sure we look at it that way, but certainly the key to a lot of our businesses is being able to manage utilization rate. And the more growth we have the easier it is to manage those utilization rates, the easier it is to maintain and\/or grow your margins. What we strive to do that regardless of what the growth rates are across all of our businesses. So FX has certainly posed a bit of a challenge for us from the margin perspective which is why I think we are not projecting and predicting and committing to what our margin is going to be for the full year \u201915. But we always strive to find the right balance, we are always looking for efficiencies and trying to make our businesses more effective in the way they manage their cost structure. We had a number of initiatives that have been going on for sometime in the areas of real estate, IT and some others that we certainly continue to see the benefit of. And we are expecting if we need to push those initiatives in \u201915, so that they can help us to offset whatever challenges the FX does present. And as we have said earlier, the businesses themselves are largely hedged naturally in terms of the local currency of the expenses is the same as the local currency of the revenues. So, that\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s still certainly a challenge and we are going to continue to work through it everyday.","David Bank","Okay. John, you said you had a follow-up?","John Wren","As soon as I said I have listened to Phil and he added all.","David Bank","Thanks. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Stabler","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. John, want to ask you about the media business separate from the programmatic stuff, media has been called out by you guys and your leading competitors as a significant contributor and outperform our \u2013 I don\u2019t know maybe for the last four to six quarters, wondering if you could give a little perspective on what you think the drivers of this outperformance is? Is it the complexity of the landscape? We hear a lot about pricing pressure in media pitches, but it just doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. So, any perspective here would be great? Thanks very much.","John Wren","Certainly. I do think the complexity of the marketplace has caused people to pay more attention to media and in the thinking about media, God knows how many places you can place your messaging today, but focusing and getting that right is becoming increasingly important. So, the analysts, the people that we employ, the digital channels or channels that we select through the client to place that media is a critical attention in this environment. And we won I believe more than our fair share of media accounts being planning assignments or buying assignments over the last several years and it\u2019s being reflected in the numbers now. If you saw the trade magazines yesterday, OMD was named agency of the year. So, we are getting the recognition not only in the business that we get, but also from peer groups and industry groups.","Peter Stabler","I know, it\u2019s tough for you to forecast, but as you look at \u201815, do you think media could be an out-performer for this year as well?","John Wren","I do.","Peter Stabler","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Nollen representing Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Tim Nollen","Hi, thank you very much. I wonder if you could give a comment please at this stage beginning of the year of what client, how client budgets feel if I could put it that way. It seems like your organic performance has been very strong despite what is felt like some crimping of budget. I wonder if you would comment a bit on if there is any expansion of budget opportunities this year in general or maybe if you are seeing some pent-up demand or do you still feel like advertisers are just kind of holding back? And if you have any specific sector commentary that will be great considering especially the consumer packaged goods sector? Thanks.","John Wren","In general, what we have seen to-date in process is the budgets are similar to the budget for \u201814 with growth in few categories more so than others. I think the other dynamic that\u2019s occurring is as channels are developed and utilize them and you measure a better ROI on them, you will see a shift in the dollars, which for some it will look like growth, because it will be and for others as that money shifted from different channels in media, it will seem like there is the lack of growth. So, overall though, I think budgets are growing consistent with GDP growth in most markets.","Tim Nollen","Any specific sector commentary?","John Wren","I suspect that German Cargill is going to have a brand time in 2015 because of the currency slinks. There are different sectors, different dynamics which drove those sectors.","Tim Nollen","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","And we have a question from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Craig Huber","Yes, good morning. I have got a few questions. Your comment about the currency impact on the margin in the quarter, I think you said was a slight, should we assume that\u2019s zero to 7 basis points year-over-year, it\u2019s my first question?","John Wren","I didn\u2019t understand the question.","Craig Huber","What was the impact, please on currency on margins year-over-year in the quarter, can you quantify that number?","John Wren","In Q4, I would say that there was an impact, but it was relatively small less than 10 basis points in the quarter.","Craig Huber","Okay. And then typically each quarter you guys shoot to have net new business wins of $1 billion and a little bit higher, what was that in the fourth quarter, please?","John Wren","That was about $1.25 billion for the quarter.","Craig Huber","Okay. Phil on the debt side, how much room do you think you have to add more debt potentially to buyback more stock or small acquisitions and not impact your credit rating?","Phil Angelastro","I think we don\u2019t exactly look at it that way in terms of how much more leverage we could or we would like to add. I think the goal here and the approach has always been to maintain our rating, which I guess you commented on there. But I think we are going to look at our free cash flow in \u201815 the same way we always have. And I think I am calling it up what we do with our cash. We are going to continue to pay healthy dividend. We will do acquisitions opportunistically as the opportunities arise. And we would certainly like to do more of those in \u201915, there maybe some opportunities given some of the weaknesses in currencies, perhaps. But we don\u2019t have a fixed number going into \u201815 that we plan on expending on acquisitions or plan on spending on share buybacks, but certainly it will be a healthy component of how we use our cash.","Craig Huber","And then lastly John, if I could ask as you think about this year in terms of organic revenue growth for 2015, if I recall correctly, I think a year ago you guys thought organic revenue for 2014 would be up 4% to 4.5%, is your feeling somewhat similar as you are heading into 2015?","John Wren","I am actually a little bit more cautious than that. At this point, I see it is more around 3.5%. And then we will see as markets and the business develop. That \u2013 I mean the way to read that prediction is, I am cautiously optimistic. And we will do our best to beat it, but that\u2019s as much as I will be willing to commit over phone in February.","Craig Huber","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Julien Roch representing Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julien Roch","Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. The question on use of cash, I know you have just said that you didn\u2019t have a fixed number in mind in terms of buyback and M&A for 2015, but it would be a healthy proportion of the cash, but I guess if we start with your current net debt-to-EBITDA, maybe you have an indication of where you would like to be at the end of the year, in that way we can make our own assumption between dividend, buyback and M&A, but having a \u2013 maybe an indication of the overall envelop for 2015 would be useful, that\u2019s my first question. The second one is on programmatic, you said that the impact was about $20 million in Q4, could we have the same number for the full year, please? These are my two questions.","Phil Angelastro","On the first one, I think where we are at year end \u201814 in two times range for total debt to EBITDA is probably where you can expect us to be. That\u2019s roughly then where we have been historically, we continue to look to maintain that ratio and I think that would be a good guide. I think the net debt number is a little bit harder to predict given the currency impact on that number. So I think we are going to focus on the later or the gross debt number a little bit more. And in terms of programmatic, I think we may have mentioned it earlier in our responses, but the contribution to growth was about $20 million or so that reflects from the cycling in Q4 on a strong performance in Q4 of \u201813 that we had mentioned, you can recall.","Julien Roch","No, you did mention the $20 million that was for Q4, I was hoping we could get that number for the full year.","Phil Angelastro","While the full year, the business itself for the full year is little less than 2% of our revenues and for the full year I think the number was just give me a minute \u2013 okay, the full year, the number was probably around in the $140 million range.","Julien Roch","Okay, thank you very much. Very useful.","Operator","Our next question today is from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan Salmon","Hey, good morning, everyone. Phil, just a quick one for you, you\u2019ve noted in your prepared remarks a little higher international cash balance contributing to investment income, I was just curious are we facing a situation where that balance is growing a little bit faster than you are finding uses of it for considering that\u2019s largely M&A. Do we have a situation where you feel like you are feeling a little constricted in what you can do with that? I am just curious to hear how those dynamics of where the cashes are changing?","Phil Angelastro","No, I think the comment specifically related to higher international cash in Q4 versus Q3 of this year, so that we typically see in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. I think it was part of the explanation of the change in interest from Q3 to Q4. So, we don\u2019t see it growing any different than we have in the past. I think we certainly are focused on bringing as much cash that\u2019s overseas back to the U.S. as we can in a tax efficient way. That\u2019s something we focus on a daily basis frankly, because we would rather have it back to the U.S. to deploy it, but I think given the current FX environment, current economic environment, we think we are likely to see some opportunity in Europe and frankly in some of the other markets outside the U.S. that might be a little more traffic to us from a pricing perspective. And if we do find them in \u201815, we are going to be happy to complete those acquisitions.","Dan Salmon","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Ben Swinburne representing Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks. Good morning. Two questions. John, just going back to your outlook for \u201815, last year you guys did almost 6% organic, I realized programmatic drove part of that strength, but the underlying business grew quite nicely. Why do you think \u201815 will grow couple of 100 basis points slower? Is programmatic part of that deceleration? It would seem like the macro tailwinds in the U.S. are strong, QE in Europe is potentially going to help. I am just curious to get a little more color there? And then I just wanted to ask you about the Facebook relationship there.","John Wren","Sure. Well, the programmatic, we have cycled on that and we have not gone into the supply side of that. So, I am expecting good growth from it, but not the type of growth we have had as we were starting it up. In terms of the marketplace, we continue to win business, there is no question, thank God we do, but with all the unrest in the world, I am just being optimistic but conservative in observing the obvious that it appears that the entire world\u2019s economy is slowed down a bit. And we can make claims that we are going to outgrow that historically. We have been \u2013 historically, we do at least 100 basis points better than GDP growth. But there is a great deal of unrest out there. And so we will alter that estimate as we get more sight on it, as we go through the year, but right now, very comfortable with the 3.5% and I think that\u2019s what we are going to see for \u2013 until some of these things start to clear up.","Ben Swinburne","Got it. And just on the Facebook relationship announced with a lot of fanfare back in the fall, can you just update us on client response and sort of how that partnership is progressing from a data perspective? And if I could sneak one more back on programmatic to Phil on, is there is any impact to free cash flow particularly working capital from programmatic, a big year-over-year swing in working cap that impacted free cash flow, just wanted to see if that had to with programmatic?","Phil Angelastro","Programmatic, no, not at all.","Ben Swinburne","Okay.","Phil Angelastro","And our relation with Facebook has been outstanding. They have been \u2013 they have given us a great deal of resources associated with the projects we are working on together, and relationship between Omnicom, Annalect and Facebook is very, very strong. We are good partners.","Ben Swinburne","Okay. Thanks.","Phil Angelastro","Yes, one more.","John Wren","I think, given the timing operator of the market open, I think we have time for one more call.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today will come from line of James Dix with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","James Dix","Good morning, guys. Just one follow-up on your growth outlook for 2015, John you mentioned the potential impact in the U.S. from lower energy prices, just curious whether you are seeing any impact on the client budget planning so far or is that just something you expect to see, if those lower oil prices continue. And then secondly just longer-term, John, you also mentioned you expect an accelerating shift to digital. Some of your senior operating management has been public about, trying to get clients to think about moving more of their budgets to video, in particular just curious to what is your view is of the potential impact on television budget since that\u2019s really biggest source of spending for most of your clients globally and how do you think that dynamic plays out of the digital shift? Thank you?","John Wren","The first part of your question, gas prices at this point, we haven\u2019t seen clients come in with new budgets as a result of it. It just seems the current gas prices from where we said is like a tax break for the American consumer. And if history bears out that consumer will be out spending money. Clients will anticipate and react to that as it becomes reality later and I think later throughout \u201815. At least, we are hopeful that that\u2019s going to be the case. And the second part of your question, I am sorry, I didn\u2019t write it down, can you repeat the second part?","James Dix","Sure, just what you think the impactions are in particular for TV budgets given your commentary that you think the shift to digital could be accelerating over the longer term and some public commentary by some of your senior operating management, the clients should be thinking about shifting more of their budget to video in particular?","John Wren","Yes. Our folks too believe that there will be a shift \u2013 a greater shifts or continuing shift to digital or really streaming type of activities. The device in which it gets streamed on is not as important to us, so we don\u2019t focus on it. So, there are lot of TV owners that own, media owners that own ultimate channels or own content that would be interested in order to get it to be streamed. So, I am not expert enough to comment in general on the TV business, but I do see anything that can be streamed on whatever device, you have to stream it on that\u2019s where I see the increase coming.","James Dix","Great. Thank you very much.","John Wren","Thank you. Thanks everybody for joining the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and using the AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."]}}
