At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investors Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thank you, Brandon, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities' third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.","As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. This attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to the Q3 call. Joining me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Matt and I will provide management commentary on the slides that we posted last night and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.","Our comments this morning will focus on providing a summary of the results for the quarter, an overview of economic and apartment fundamentals, and their impact on current portfolio performance, a review of investment and portfolio management activity where we were very active this past quarter. And finally, we'll share some progress on our Columbus Circle mixed-use development.","Starting now on slide 4, our highlights for the quarter include the core FFO growth of 4.1%, which was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our Q3 outlook. You'll note that we've increased the midpoint of our full-year 2018 outlook by $0.03 to $9 per share.","Same-store revenue growth came in at 2.3% and the same-store NOI growth was 3.1% for the quarter. The midpoint of the range for same-store performance, revenues, expenses and NOI, remain unchanged from our mid-year updated outlook. You'll note, however, we did provide additional ranges for a revised same-store basket that excludes the New York JV assets, assuming that deal closes prior to the end of the year as expected.","We completed $315 million in new development for the quarter at an average initial projected yield of 6.2% and have now completed $740 million at a 6.4% projected yield for the year. We also started two new communities totaling just over $200 million in Q3. And lastly, we raised $170 million of external capital through the sale of one community at an average cap rate of just under 4.5%.","Turning now to slide 5 and an overview of fundamentals, I'll just go through this quickly. As all of you know, the U.S. economy is very healthy currently with the GDP growth running around 3.5%, corporate profits surging by double digits, labor markets one of the tightest we've seen so far this cycle, and the household wealth recently reaching record highs before the recent pullback in the equity markets.","Turning to slide 6, the economy is being driven by both the business sector and the consumer. Strong business and consumer sentiment is translating into increased levels of capital investment and household formation, both of which are good signs for the economy in the housing market over the next few quarters.","While these and most other leading indicators are still pointing up, there are some potential risks that are worth watching, including rising geopolitical tensions, the threat of trade wars, and the normalization of interest rates through continued Fed tightening. But, overall, it appears we'll have a solid macro environment in which to operate over the next few quarters.","Turning to slide 7, this favorable macro environment is in turn supporting apartment fundamentals, which are showing signs of renewed strength with several drivers of rental demand turning up, including young-adult job growth, which is running above 2% again; wage growth reaching a cyclical high; and housing affordability actually hitting a cyclical low; all positive trends for apartment demand. These drivers are all further supported by demographics as the young-adult age cohort, or those under 34, is projected to experience decent growth for the next five years and not peak until 2024.","Turning now to slide 8 in the supply side of the equation. It appears we're beginning to see some early signs of relief in supply, as both permits and starts have been declining in our markets for most of the year. In fact, over the last two quarters, on a seasonally adjusted basis, starts and permits are down by over 20% in the prior two quarters. This is probably mostly due to construction cost inflation that we've been talking about and it's been averaging in the high-single-digit range over the last year, with some regions like the Bay Area even reaching double-digit growth.","With rent growth generally averaging 2% to 3% over the last year, projected yields on prospective deals have deteriorated by 25 basis points to 50 basis points over the last year, so depending upon the market. It stands to reason then that this would begin to have an impact on new development investment, and that seems to be occurring in our markets and to some extent nationally.","We've also seen a pullback in the public markets as the apartment REIT sector's cut back on development underway by roughly 35% since year-end 2016. Of course, this recent pullback and start activity in 2018 won't be felt really in terms of deliveries until 2020 or late 2019 at the earliest, as we expect new deliveries to remain elevated over the next four quarters or so, as you can see in the box in the lower right in this chart.","Turning now to slide 9, as you might expect, improving demand fundamentals are starting to translate into stronger portfolio performance. And indeed, this is happening. This chart depicts the four-quarter moving average in like-term rent change for our same-store portfolio.","As you can see, rent change has started to turn up \u2013 again, this is a four-quarter moving average \u2013 driven by improvement in Q2 and Q3, which posted stronger rent growth than the same quarters last year with Q3 average rent growth of 3.2% or 70 basis points greater than Q3 of last year. Similarly, growth potential for the same-store portfolio has started to turn up and in Q3 was at 2.3% or 60 basis points higher than Q3 of 2017 for the same-store portfolio.","And turning to slide 10, most of our regions saw solid improvement in the quarter. Northern California saw the biggest bounce with rent growth of 4%, which was 250 basis points higher than Q3 of last year. All three East Coast regions saw good improvement in the 50 basis points to 100 basis points range. Southern California saw modest deceleration and Seattle more significant deceleration from the prior year. Q3 rent growth in both of those regions, however, was still at or above the portfolio average of 3.2%.","These trends have largely continued into Q4 with like-term rents up by about 3% in October. In addition, rent growth is broad-based with every region currently in the 2.5% to 4% range, and the East and West performing roughly in line with one another for the first time since 2011.","I'll now turn it over to Matt, who will discuss investment and portfolio management activities past quarter. Matt?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Tim. Turning first to our current development activity. As you can see on slide 11, our completions this year have continued to meet our initial underwriting and deliver very healthy value creation with yields of 6.4% compared to estimated cap rates for those same assets of roughly 4.5%. In addition, our development portfolio is generating lease-up NOI as expected, contributing to earnings in 2018 right in line with our initial guidance.","This quarter we completed Avalon Dogpatch, our largest development completion of the year. This wood frame community which is uniquely positioned in an emerging neighborhood of San Francisco that offers mainly high-rise product was delivered at a very compelling basis, which in turn contributes to its 6.2% yield, a remarkable result for the Bay Area.","Turning to slide 12, we have an excellent long-term track record of delivering new communities in accordance with our initial budgets. This is in large part due to us acting as our own general contractor in most cases and having a majority of our trade costs locked in at the time we start a new project. This is particularly important given the increasing cost base in our industry.","As Tim indicated, construction inflation is running well ahead of rent increases, a particularly acute issue in the tech markets on the West Coast. This quarter, we did recognize cost increases on two wood frame projects currently under construction in the East Bay in Emeryville and Walnut Creek. These budget increases, which collectively total approximately $40 million or 15% of our original estimate for those two projects, were the result of unexpected union pressures and subcontractor performance issues.","These two projects are exceptions to the general trend which continues to reflect excellent construction execution. And across our current overall development portfolio, even including these two communities, our actual costs are tracking within 1.6% of the original budget as shown on the slide.","Turning to slide 13, our sector-leading development platform continues to provide excellent risk-adjusted returns with approximately $3 billion in value creation so far this cycle and another $800 million expected from the development currently underway. While new starts may be less profitable than early cycle deals due to the cost pressures just mentioned, we are confident that long-term returns will still be highly accretive, consistent with our track record as shown in the chart in the upper left. And we continue to manage capital markets risk by match-funding our development activity as shown in the lower right.","Turning to slide 14, our transactions team has had a productive year. As we executed on our strategy to rotate capital into our expansion markets of Denver and Southeast Florida, we are on track to complete the acquisition of four communities before year-end, including two suburban garden properties in the Denver area, the high-rise in downtown West Palm Beach and a garden community in the Baltimore-Washington Corridor just north of BWI Airport and the NSA headquarters at Fort Meade.","We've been opportunistically funding both our acquisition and development activity primarily through the transaction market, as shown in the table on the left-hand side of the slide. We will have sold over $1.2 billion in wholly-owned assets by year-end, which after netting out $335 million in planned acquisitions leaves us as net sellers of roughly $895 million during the course of the year, providing cost-effective capital to fund our external investment activity.","To provide a little bit more detail on the Manhattan JV transaction, as we announced earlier this month and as shown on slide 15, we are selling an 80% interest in five stabilized properties valued at $760 million on a gross basis. As we've indicated for the past several years, our allocation to the Greater New York region is a bit higher than we would like and this imbalance would otherwise be trending even higher due to the development pipeline we have in the region.","We have sold about $1.1 billion in suburban New York assets over the last four years, but have not sold any wholly-owned properties in New York City itself until now. This transaction further reduces our allocation to the Greater New York region, while preserving our brand presence and rebalances our allocation within the region to roughly $130 million (13:06) each in the city, the New Jersey suburbs, and suburban New York including Long Island and Westchester.","It is important to note that while these are among the most highly valued assets in our portfolio, there is a material difference between the short-term earnings yield or initial investment return and the transaction cap rate as that term is defined by various market participants. This is due to the presence of property tax abatements on all five assets and a ground lease structure on two of the assets, which provide a short-term boost to cash flow until their expirations and\/or resets.","Consequently, the unlevered earnings yield on the assets is in the low-5% range. But this yield is roughly 150 basis points higher than what might be considered a normalized cap rate after adjusting for these factors.","The impact of the JV transaction on our portfolio can be seen on slide 16. Metro New York share of our total NOI will drop from 24% to 22%, closer to our long-term target of 20%.","Moving to slide 17, I'd like to provide an update on our Columbus Circle development. This asset includes approximately 67,000 square feet of prime retail space on Broadway and 172 residential units, and is on track for completion next year.","Turning first to the retail component of the project, this slide shows our leasing progress to-date. We are pleased to report that we have executed a 35,000-square-foot lease for the two below-grade floors and a main entrance on Broadway to Target. In addition, we are in advanced negotiations to lease just under half of the second floor space as well. These two tenants will bring us to 65% leased by square footage and 45% leased by revenue, and both are at economics at or better than our initial underwriting. We expect to turn over both spaces for TI work to these tenants in early 2019.","As to the residential component, we are currently exploring a shift from rental apartments to for-sale condominiums. From the beginning, one of the most appealing aspects of this project, apart from its absolutely AAA location, has been the flexibility it provides with no tax abatements, zoning restrictions, or affordable component that would impede a condominium strategy if it offer a better return profile.","While the Manhattan condo market has softened somewhat over the last year, as shown in the lower left corner of slide 18, our building offers some compelling advantages as indicated in the upper-right-hand side of the slide. Our average unit size of roughly 1,100 square feet, while large for a Manhattan rental building, would actually be on the smaller side for a condominium offering, which in turn allows for lower whole-dollar pricing than most other new product on the market.","As a result, 85% of our homes would be priced below $5 million at our initial projected target pricing with a wide variety of price points depending on unit size and location in the building, averaging roughly $3.2 million to $3.5 million per home.","And between the 8-foot deep (15:54) facing Broadway and the balconies on the other frontages, more than 40% of the units have private outdoor space, an extreme rarity for such a prime Manhattan address. The outdoor space is not included in the average unit size, providing even greater value to potential buyers.","We're still studying this option in greater detail, but our economic analysis suggests that at current market pricing, there could be more than $150 million in additional pre-tax value through a condo execution. To maximize our optionality, we are proceeding with some modest upgrades to the finishes in the building, which we believe would have value under either scenario and which will increase the expected total capital cost by less than 5%.","If we decide to proceed with the condo execution, we would open for sales in March or April of next year, establish a threshold level of minimum sales contracts which we would require before finalizing the condo regime and proceeding the first settlement. Of course, we will continue to keep you apprised of our progress and our thinking on this as it evolves.","With that, I'll turn it back to Tim.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thanks, Matt. So, in summary, a healthy U.S. economy is supporting stronger apartment market fundamentals in most of our regions, with same-store rent change improving over the last two quarters and so far in Q4. Development activities generally tracking expectations in terms of lease-up and yield performance, although we are experiencing some cost challenges in certain markets, as Matt mentioned.","We continue to make progress on our portfolio management objectives through activity in the transaction and joint venture market. And lastly, as Matt just mentioned, we're making really solid strides in retail leasing at our Columbus Circle mixed-use development where we're also evaluating a condo execution on the residential component. And we'll certainly continue to share our thinking with that as we explore this opportunity further over the next couple of quarters.","So, with that, Brandon, we'll be happy to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question will come from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. On Columbus Circle, when do you need to make a final decision on condo execution versus rental?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Matt, why don't you walk Nick through kind of the timeline there?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So, Nick, what we're thinking is that we would start some early pre-marketing shortly in the next month or two, just to start building a prospect list. And then, if we're feeling comfortable with it, we would open a sales center onsite probably in March.","One of the things we have to offer that most other new condos don't is that we would have the product to actually show. So we think by March or April, we'll have a floor in the tower with four different unit types complete and kind of white-glove-ready as it were, which would provide \u2013 so we're not thinking pre-sales before we actually have product to show.","But if we open on that schedule, we'd open in kind of March, April. And then if we were going to do that, we would just see how it goes. We would establish internally a minimum threshold percentage of units that we would want to have under contract before we locked-in. And that might take anywhere from two to four months, depending on how sales go.","But it wouldn't be until after we reach that threshold, whatever it would be 30%, 40%, 50%, whatever we want, that we would then actually record the condo and start settlement. So we would have optionality all the way up until that point.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Nick. And maybe just to add to that, it's probably obvious, but the opportunity costs would be potentially some lost lease-up revenue over the two to three or four months that Matt mentioned, as we're seeing the kind of traction that a condo execution would get, so.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Makes sense. And if settlements do begin in the back half of next year, what do you underwrite in, in terms of timing for a total sell-out?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","To some extent, that's going to be a function of pricing and that gets into some of our tactics and strategy. I don't think we're really at a point where we want to throw a target out there yet at this point for that.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And just, finally, given the progress made on the retail we've seen, what are the longer-term plans for the retail? And will you look to sell it once it's leased or are you comfortable owning and operating longer-term?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Nick. It's Matt again. I think we would probably expect to complete the lease-up of the retail space in the next year or two, and then we'll look and we'll see. Hopefully, there'll be good NOI stream in place. But we may well turn around and decide to sell that in a couple of years because obviously it is a large retail asset and that's not our core business. But to get maximum execution on that, to go ahead and lease it up, and then we'll kind of see what it feels like at that time.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Hey. Good morning, everybody. Maybe just to quickly follow-up on the Columbus Circle retail question there. Can you give us a sense of just how competitive the leasing process was for the space that Target took down and then also what is currently being offered to the market there?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, Rich. It's Matt. I can speak to that a little bit again. There's been a lot of interest from a lot of different categories and for all different kinds of space. We have three very different priced spaces. We have the subgrade space, we have the Broadway frontage ground-level space, and then we have the second floor space. So, at this point, all the subgrade space, a little bit of the ground floor just for the entry for Target and the entry for the second floor tenant and about half of the second floor is spoken for. So, what we're left with, it's still available, would be probably 85% of the ground floor and a little more than half of the second floor.","And we continue to see \u2013 it's different categories of users. Obviously, those are different rent levels, so they're different kind of tenants. So we've had pretty good interest from a wide variety of tenants for the space Target took. We've had a reasonable amount of interest on the second floor. The ground floor space is the most expensive space and probably the space that \u2013 the thought was we needed to get the anchor tenant set first and that would generate more traction there. We are talking to folks, but we always expected that to probably be the last space to lease. So we're kind of not surprised with where that sits today.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","All right. Thanks for the color there. And then my second question, I appreciate the detail in the earnings release surrounding the New York City JV portfolio impact on same-store results for 2018. Can you help us understand, I guess, in rough terms what the impact on 2019 same-store would be from those assets being excluded from the portfolio?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Rich, this is Sean. And to the extent that we complete the execution of the JV, whether it's December or January, those assets would be removed from same-store. So there would not be an impact on same-store per se. It would be removed for both periods for both 2018 and 2019 in terms of the calculation of the same-store metrics for the calendar year 2019, if that's your specific question.","The issues that led to the potential change in guidance as a result of the closing of the JV relate to two specific issues. One is the ground lease that we disclosed previously that we acquired; the fee for Morningside Park last December, that's about $2.3 million. And then, there is another roughly $700,000 that relates to the write-off of a retail leased from third quarter of last year. So those are obviously a tailwind as it relates to the 2018 same-store results, particularly on operating expenses, and there was an impact on NOI.","So, that's why it was necessary to basically indicate what the impact on the same-store performance would be by changing the composition of the bucket with and without the New York JV assets.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Yeah. I guess...","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","But just...","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Oh, go ahead. Sorry.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Aside from those two factors, the impact was negligible to the overall same-store.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. We're pretty much tracking where we thought we'd be in terms of all the same-store metrics, except for the impact of the New York transaction.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Okay. Yeah. And I guess to be clear, I mean, obviously the pool will change in terms of the calculation next year. But I guess my question would be, let's assume they were in the pool for all of 2019 and then we compare that number to what the pool without them in 2019 would be, just to get a sense of growth across the rest of the portfolio, if that helps frame it a little better.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we're not ready to talk about 2019 in detail just yet. But certainly New York is a market that we'd be talking about that there's a fair amount of supply this year. The supply starts to fall off somewhat next year. So you might see some marginal improvement there. But we haven't run through all the metrics in terms of the calculation of what we expect from New York and those assets in 2019 yet to be able to give you enough insight into what the impact would have been if we didn't sell them and they remained in the same-store.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Nicholas Yulico - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Thank you. So, your forecast for supply in 2019 is a little bit higher than this year. Could you break that down, the impact among some of your major markets where you see supply getting tougher or easier?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Nick, this is Sean. Happy to address that maybe at a sort of regional level and then insight on a few markets. But as it relates to 2019, in terms of what we expect relative to 2018, we do see supply drifting down a bit in New England, primarily in Boston, up a little bit around 30 basis points in the mid-Atlantic, and then up about 80 basis points in Northern California.","And if you look at the markets where there's some meaningful change to really talk about in terms of increases in supply in 2019 relative to 2018, D.C. is about 3,500 units and then the East Bay and San Jos\u00e9 are each about 2,400 units in 2019 and beyond what they projected to deliver in 2018.","In terms of meaningful declines, what we can see for sure, Boston about 1,100 units, Baltimore about 2,000, Orange County about 1,200, about 2,000 in San Diego. We do expect to see a decline in New York City, but given the nature of the construction and delivery cycle there, there's some question as to what's going to be delayed moving into next year. So we expect some modest reduction there, probably not what would have been anticipated mid-year when we saw it at that point, which is more meaningful, but we'll be scrubbing that pipeline later in the fourth quarter to provide good solid updates when we get into the January call.","Nicholas Yulico - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then going back to the potential condo sales now in New York, I get that the overall NAV impact may be higher, or the NAV benefit may be higher. But how do you weigh that versus taxes you'd have to pay on sales of units, economic risk for selling units rather than leasing them and, lastly, how this all sort of plays into FFO? And I'd say it feels like investors have kind of discredited condo sales income in FFO historically for REITs. So, how do you kind of weigh all that?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Nick, Tim here. First of all, as an investment, when we first got into this, we had a sense that maybe condo may be the highest and best use, just given the fact there's no affordables here, just the outstanding location. We programmed the community to give us some optionality. While the units are smaller than a typical condominium, they're larger than the typical rental. So we'd always sort of programmed this to provide some optionality.","As we got further into construction and we saw what the potential differential was between a rental value, capital highs and condominium, we just thought we owed it to ourselves as a good capital steward to explore further. And, as Matt mentioned, we think the differential may be about $150 million on a pre-tax basis. So, even if you calculate some tax in there, so that's probably still talking about a nine-figure differential. And we think that we owe it to ourselves to explore that.","And just the fact that this building is going to be ready for occupancy sometime next year, it is a unique advantage in that we have existing units that we can sell, whereas a lot of condos that are on the market today are on a pre-sale basis that are well beyond that kind of time period in which they can deliver.","So the cost here, the opportunity cost is a little bit of upgrades that we think we can capture value on the rental side as well. But it's really sort of foregone lease-up NOI for a few months. If we decide that demand just isn't there at the kind of values that we thought, we can always turn the lease-up on this thing in really a couple weeks.","So I think the risk profile, this is maybe a little different than somebody who's thinking about this from ground-up perspective. Renting is our base business, and so if that's the fallback, we don't really see where the extra risk is. And we'll probably ultimately will require a higher pre-sale requirement before making the condominium effective than maybe somebody who is building a condominium purpose-built from the beginning.","So, hopefully, that's responsive to the questions. It's something we've been thinking a lot in terms of how to just risk-manage this opportunity. And as Matt laid out in his schedule, we think we've done that. And as we said, we'll continue to keep both the analysts and investment community very well informed as to how we're seeing the market and how it's playing out.","Nicholas Yulico - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Just a question on the strength or lack thereof of seasonality this year. Have you seen any benefits from an elongated seasonal lease-up period that may act as a headwind as we think about 2019 versus 2018?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Juan, this is Sean. Not really. I mean, things are pretty much falling within a traditional cycle for us in terms of seasonality. So I don't think there's any material impact if you look at it. I mean, there was some discussion around that topic a couple of years ago as it relates to some specific markets and what was happening and a shortened durations to the leasing season, but nothing unusual in terms of what we're seeing this year that would bleed into 2019.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just going back to Nick's question about developments and kind of the earnings impact from an FFO perspective, I guess is there any development \u2013 or should we think about any risk to FFO on developments coming online for 2019 kind of with and without going condo on the Upper West Side project?","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Juan, this is Kevin. The only development that really is relevant here would be on the Circle. And as Tim alluded to, there would be as a consequence of pursuing a condo strategy, if we go that route, a couple of impacts as we've discussed. We wouldn't have the lease-up NOI, you'd have capitalized interest ceasing as it would for a rental but it would be stopped once those units were made available, and then probably be some marketing costs associated with the pursuit of a condo strategy that would probably be carved out of core FFO.","So those are probably the two big things, the fact that there might be condo gains that would be carved out of core FFO, marketing costs would be carved out of core FFO. And then I guess the third thing is lease-up NOI that wouldn't be present on the residential piece. There may be one or two other things, but those are the main things.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","And when we give our outlook in January 1, we'll be explicit as to what our underlying assumptions are with respect to Columbus Circle and lease-up income as we have this year.","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Juan, just one other thing to add to that. I'm not sure if you were referring to this or not, but there was some discussion as we moved into 2018 that our deliveries in 2018 would be down a fair bit relative to 2017. As we move into 2019, we do expect deliveries to come back up to levels that are more consistent with what we saw in 2017. Obviously, you have to set aside the Columbus Circle which would have different use, but you'd start to see more deliveries coming through which would obviously look different to us in terms of earnings impact in 2019 versus 2018.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And do you guys mind giving the portfolio-wide new and renewals for the third quarter and what you're setting out the fourth quarter numbers at for renewals?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of portfolio-wide numbers as opposed to individual markets, I mean, as Tim alluded to in terms of October, we're running around 3% in terms of blended rent change for the entire portfolio. And then if you're looking at offers, offers are sort of in the mid-6% range for November and December.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. This is really the first quarter we've seen turnover increase in some time, and I'm just curious if this was necessarily by design or just a function on the higher rents on renewals starting to force tenants out? And then, did you see any notable increase, I guess, in the regions for move-out?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Austin. This is Sean. What you're seeing is a little bit of an anomaly. We had more expirations in the third quarter of this year relative to the third quarter of last year. So, if you look at it, turnover as a percentage of expirations, it was actually down about 220 basis points, pretty consistent with what we've seen through most of this year in terms of reduced turnover. But there is a change to the expiration profile that moves the numbers a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. So, in general, the trend has been down in terms of reduced turnover, and that remains the case.","So, in terms of reasons for move-out, there's no material changes whatsoever in terms of what we've seen this year relative to last year. It's been pretty consistent.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the clarification. And then, as you evaluated the New York City joint venture, I mean, did you consider including any assets in the outer boroughs, I guess, considering that's where it seems like a significant portion of the new supply is being delivered over the next several quarters?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Austin. It's Matt. We didn't. Actually the portfolio that we brought to the market was all Manhattan assets and it was all stabilized assets. And that was by design that for the types of capital we were looking to partner with and selling a partial interest sale, we wanted a portfolio that had a fair amount of consistency to it. And so we were advised by the folks who were working with on it, and I think appropriately, that the more consistent the portfolio could be the better. And for many capital sources, there's still obviously deep, deep institutional demand in the boroughs as well, but that would be kind of the thing that would get the most attention from the capital that we were targeting.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Drew Babin with Baird. Please go ahead.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning. A question on New Jersey. It looked like revenue growth year-over-year decelerated a bit in 3Q relative to 2Q. And I was just wondering with a decent amount of supply looking to come to North Jersey next year, is that a market that you expect to maybe be a bit softer going forward? And I guess can you talk about Northern Jersey versus some of the properties you have in Central Jersey and what's going on there?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Drew, this is Sean. Happy to chat about that. In terms of Northern New Jersey, we don't have a significant portfolio there. And I'd say what's probably most exposed in this supply, as it normally is, is our Jersey City asset. Yeah, there's a fair amount on the Gold Coast being done, but we don't have a big presence there other than potential impacts on Jersey City. So you will see some impact there.","And the rest of the assets in Bergen County are generally, at this point, in terms of the nature of how they perform, they tend to be not super high data assets is the way I'd describe them. So they're not right along the Gold Coast in terms of sensitivity to new supply. So they tend to just chug along and perform quite well, same thing with the Central Jersey assets for the most part.","So they don't present a lot of volatility, but they tend to be stable environments like this where there's a lot of supply at the high end, whether it's in the city or on the Gold Coast in Northern New Jersey. So we'll provide better insight into it in terms of the supply as we get into next year, but it's a pretty stable book of business overall. It kind of runs like Long Island in terms of performing pretty well without a lot of volatility.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And I guess a related question as you kind of rotate around New York City, the Fairfield-New Haven market, it's not in the New York metro disclosures, doesn't really grow like Boston but also not a lot of new supply. I guess, how should we think about that market long-term? And is there potentially a point where that might make sense for harvesting some capital?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I'm happy to comment on that and then Matt can as well. We certainly have been a net seller in the Greater Fairfield market over the last few years. And based on what we're seeing overall in terms of demand drivers in that environment, independent of supply, we probably will likely to be a net seller.","But, again, that market tends to perform just like the other ones that I mentioned, tends to run \u2013 I mean, we're talking about 2% year-over-year kind of numbers right now. It tends to hold between, I'd say, 1.5% and 2.5% historically in terms of revenue growth if you look at it over a longer period of time. But to the extent that we find opportunity to sell some of those assets, some of which are uniquely positioned potentially as for-sale assets or others or other uses as rental, we will certainly consider that.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Drew, this is Matt. I'll just add to that a little bit. We do think of Fairfield and New Haven, they're actually two separate MSAs. So we're pretty much out of New Haven at this point. We sold Milford last year, which I think was our last asset in the New Haven MSA. But of what we have left in Fairfield, a lot of it is much further kind of down county, closer to New York City with better train connectivity. But there are still probably a few assets that are a little more far-flung that we are likely to sell there in the next couple years.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That helps. And then lastly, a question for Kevin on the balance sheet. Seeing property yield on sales obviously down in the mid-4x range, as 30-year debt sort of in the mid-4x range, is there a certain point where if that costs begin to creep up more that you might considered even lower leverage model if the economics between selling properties and secured bonds, if the difference, at least in the short-term, kind of equals out? Is that something that might be explored or should we continue to think about roughly 5x net debt-to-EBITDA sort of the lower bound to the leverage target?","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Drew, it's Kevin. Yeah. I think for now probably thinking about our leverage target in the low 5x net debt-to-EBITDA turn level seems to make sense. Certainly, we're tracking where capital costs are today and we have been able to sell some attractively priced assets to help support our investment activity. But I think we're pretty comfortable with where our leverage is right now.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. That's really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Richard Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Ronald Kamdem - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","This is Ronald Kamdem on for Richard Hill. Just two quick ones from me. Just looking at the projected long-term goals in terms of New York, and given that that's going to be one where you continue to sell, just curious between New York City, New Jersey, New York suburban, do you guys have a sense of where some of the low-hanging fruits are? Are there going to be more sales in New York City, is it Jersey or is it sort of all around?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Ronald. This is Matt. As I've mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had been selling more in the suburbs than the cities, but this is really the first time we've sold wholly-owned asset in the city this cycle. And I think the balance right now, which is roughly a third, a third, a third, feels pretty good. So, we may lighten up a bit more in the New York metro area.","But I would look for kind of those proportions to the extent we do. Central Jersey, we might be a little heavy still because we have a lot of development actually coming in Central Jersey. So it might be a little bit more weighted that direction. But we're trying to keep the same rough proportion.","Ronald Kamdem - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And the other one, I was just \u2013 it was interesting when you mentioned the two communities in Northern California where those construction costs increased and so forth. One, is there any other markets where you're seeing that sort of pressure? And two, can you just talk about maybe some of the long-term benefits in terms of reducing supplies to those areas?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, it's interesting. The flip side of the pain, right?","Ronald Kamdem - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Certainly, in terms of hard cost pressure, Northern California would be the most extreme right now. Frankly, Denver is also seeing quite a lot of it. We're not building anything in Denver, but that is one thing that's informed our approach to partnering with others and frankly lay off some of that risk to partners, and through potential kind of capital JV-type structures that we've been looking at, similar to what we're doing in Southeast Florida with TCR in Doral.","So, Seattle has seen quite a bit of pressure. I think it has, for whatever reason, a little bit of a deeper labor market and subcontractor base. So, while it's seen also a great ramp-up in supply, it hasn't responded quite as aggressively as Northern Cal, but that would be the other region where we're seeing still very strong hard cost growth.","The impact on supply, we'll see. I think, as Tim mentioned, we're starting to see it in the start numbers in our markets in general, perhaps more so in Northern Cal. I'd tell you, on the development side, we haven't signed up a new third-party development right in Northern Cal in years. What we are focused on is entitlements where we begin to flying (44:06) in our own portfolio and we had a couple of great opportunities there and\/or public-private partnerships, like the deal we have with the city at Balboa Reservoir.","So we've certainly seen it in our behavior. And you would think at some point it would start to impact starts there. Again, we're seeing it across our portfolio. I don't know that it's disproportionately to Northern Cal right now though.","Ronald Kamdem - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful. Thank you. That's all I got.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First one, just going back to Columbus Circle, I just want to make sure I understood the catalysts more near-term. When you have the flexibility over time to think about condo versus rental I think since the transaction was initially announced, the for-sale market probably has gotten softer. And then you've got tax reform on top of that kind of creates some additional risk on the ownership side.","So, just wondering, is there something that happened more recently or something as you think about the rental assumptions that would have tilted this towards condo?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Dennis, maybe I'll start and let Matt jump in if you like. I think the one thing that maybe we underestimated was the value of selling a new condominium versus a conversion. So, just from a pure value and execution standpoint, we probably underestimated that as we thought about kind of what our options when we made the investment in the first place. So, that's informed our view a bit in terms of exploring it now rather than saying let's just lease it up and explore it when the market is white hot. So, that's probably been the biggest factor.","From a rental standpoint, the market has been pretty flat to slightly up, I think Sean mentioned. So, that really hasn't changed in terms of our view of the rental economics at least on the revenue side.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay. And then, as you think about just the backdrop of the market, you noted a couple of stats there on the slide there about contract activity being down and pricing incentives being up. What would you be assuming over the next 18, 24 months as far as the backdrop of the market? Are you just kind of holding that steady as far as the competitive nature?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, I guess the way we're thinking about it is we're going to go into this pre-marketing period and see how strong the market is and let the market tell us. And so, to the extent we get a great response there through the brokerage community, the brokerage network, we think we can start converting some of those prospects to contract within that sort of the second milestone to actually try to start building contracts.","And again, we have sort of a second opportunity to decide whether we want to move forward or not based upon the strength of the market. And again, we don't have to be committed to this route. If the weakness just is stronger than we think, then we always have the ability to lease these units up and essentially cancel any deals that we may have had in the market.","So we think we've got a couple sort of milestones here that we can sort of test the depth of the market. And if it's there, we'll go. If it's not, we'll go back to sort of plan A.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just one last question on the supply outlook. Today you're looking for relatively stable deliveries in your markets 2018 versus 2017, and then 2019 to be up a little bit. If we go back to earlier in the year, I think 2018 was going to be up more and 2019 would have been a fairly sizable drop.","Can you just maybe explain kind of the shifting between the years? How much of this is a net-net increase if you look at 2018 and 2019 together, versus just maybe delay from some of the competitive supply?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I think \u2013 Dennis, it's Sean. When we talked about it earlier in the year, I think what we said is that we expected some mild reduction probably in 2019. But given what we've seen historically, to the extent that we see more delays than what has been normal the last two or three years, those numbers could even out. And based on what we see today, that appears to be happening. So the same assets are under construction and what's actually getting delivered in 2019 is increasing as a result of some movement from 2018.","So, as I said earlier in response to one of the questions, we'll be scrubbing the pipeline hard here in Q4 before we finalize our guidance for 2019, and be able to provide a good update at that point. But to be honest, just based on where we are in the cycle for construction and the labor availability, you can say that 2019 number, you expect that probably to come down some as you move through 2019. It's just hard to get visibility on exactly where it's going to be and how much.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","But net-net, as you sit here today, is that collective 2018, 2019 in your markets higher today than earlier in the year or just distributed differently?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Distributed differently based on what we know.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Piljung Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","As a nearby resident, thanks for bringing Target to the neighborhood. On your developments, with the pullback in starts among your competitors, is your strategy now to increase your pipeline going forward or elevated costs kind of keeping you at current levels?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. John, it's Matt. I mean, our pipeline is driven by two things: Bottom-up, where are the opportunities, where are we seeing the opportunities, and are we getting appropriate risk-adjusted returns based on our underwriting. And then a little bit top-down, as we've talked about a couple quarters ago, kind of what can our balance sheet support in a leverage-neutral manner in terms of funding.","So, right now, I would say the bottom-up constraint is probably at least as significant as the top-down constraint. So we don't look at it and say, well, if the other publics are developing less, we should be developing less or more. We really look at it in terms of what deals are there out there that are underwriting that are providing us reasonable returns, and there are few of those. We've only signed up three new development rights all year this year. Interestingly, three in this past quarter, but those were the first three for the year. And one of those is a joint venture on a mall site with GGP\/Brookfield, so that's the deal we've been working on for a long time. One of them was a densification of an existing asset that we already owned, kind of like what I mentioned earlier, in Seattle, taking that strategy from Northern Cal to Seattle. We're looking at maybe an opportunity in Southern Cal now to do the same. So it's more of that kind of business.","So I think it's more a reflection of the reality that where hard costs are, it's harder to find deals that work. The ones that do, tend to be more in the suburban and in the Northeast. You look at, for example, we just started a deal this quarter in Old Bridge, New Jersey. That's a deal we've had under contract for four or five years. A market that doesn't see a lot of volatility, has seen less pressure on hard costs and still has a very strong yield.","I think, Tim, you wanted to add?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. John, just to put some numbers to it. I think we talked about this this last quarter. If you looked at the 2013 to 2016 period, we probably averaged somewhere around $1.3 billion in starts. And it was our expectation in 2017, 2018, and 2019 that was probably going to be down kind of commensurate with what I said, the overall REIT sector is down by about 35%, 40%, more in the $800 million, maybe $900 million range. And that's kind of consistent with kind of the market opportunity that we've seen as well, as Matt was mentioning in his remarks.","So, that's kind of where we see it, at least for the foreseeable future, all subject to kind of what the economics actually look like at the time which we have to actually make the capital allocation decision.","John Piljung Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And is the 6.4% yield that you've had on completions year-to-date, is that representative of your overall pipeline at Columbus Circle or when you're underwriting for new projects?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","The development rates that haven't yet started, the basket as a whole is probably in the low-6s, so it's probably just a little bit under that. But it varies a lot based on where you are in terms of geography and product type.","John Piljung Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And just one quick one on Columbus Circle. The local press is referring to the building as 1865 Broadway. Is the retail basically being rebranded or branded differently than the residential?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","No, I mean, the residential address is actually 15 West 61st Street. Whether rental or condo, that's where the front door to the residential is. It's obviously not on Broadway, which is the prime, most viable retail space. And the retail address is probably a Broadway address. There may be a second floor tenant who technically has a 61st Street address as well, but the retail engages with Broadway, the residential really engages with the side street.","John Piljung Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead.","John William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you. A bit of an oversimplification, but on the condo conversion, looks like, let's say, $110 million profit after tax, 172 units, about $650,000 in additional value created after tax. What happens to the retail we're assuming that you get out of that? Can you make any money on the retail or would the retail offset the value created on a condo?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","John, we don't expect to lose money per se on the retail. As Matt mentioned, it's not our core business area, so we're probably a little less confident in our projections here. But based upon our pro forma and the kind of rents that we're currently renting at, we think it probably contributes modestly to the profitability of this project.","John William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And then a second question. What's your crystal ball look like for hard costs over the next two or three years, assuming the economy remains reasonably healthy? Is it the north of 5% annual increases or more inflation-esque at 2% to 3%?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. No, it's a great question, John. When you're kind of in the middle of seeing these really healthy single digits, you kind of ask yourself what's going to change to sort of change that outcome. We are seeing a drop in starts in our markets. So, that's the first sort of canary in a coal mine where it might actually see some relief on pricing. You are starting to see the builders reporting order volumes being down, so that might help a little bit. But we're at full employment and we're not replacing some of the skilled labor we have in the construction trades. And so, this is maybe both a secular issue and a cyclical issue.","So I don't think we're \u2013 we're not betting that it's going to be 2% or 3% or in line with rents, and it's one of the reasons why we're trying to maintain as much optionality on the development of that portfolio as we can. So we also laid it out. Until there's some kind of correction or, ultimately, if we need to write off some of these deals, we will if we just see them as uneconomic.","John William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Last question, any effect on land prices or land prices are sort of remaining sticky?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's still too early. John, this is Matt again. We do get that question seems like every quarter. We're waiting. But land prices are sticky. I would say, for the most part, they probably stopped going up. And there are deals that aren't trading. There are land deals that aren't trading. So, in terms of maybe getting a little more favorable, people don't always expect to put it under contract today and close tomorrow. But we haven't seen any material decline in land prices that would make up for the increase in hard costs yet.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. The thing to remember, John, is land costs are generally 15% to 20% of total capital costs; whereas, construction is probably 65%, maybe as high as 70%, and soft costs maybe another 15%. So, land costs will have to come down a lot to make up for the kind of appreciation and escalation we're seeing on the construction side.","John William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead with your question.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey. Good morning down there. Two questions. First, as far as the condo and the retail at Columbus Circle, are those now both in, like, a TRS? Or as far as the retail goes, is there some sort of holding period that you need to maintain to allow that to be good REIT income versus having it be taxable?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Alex, they actually are both in TRSs.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. That's easy. And then the second question is, just as far as New York State goes, with the rent control coming up for renewal next year and the possible change in the Senate and Albany composition, is there any concern that if they change the rent control laws that that would impact your affordable units that are part of your 421-a or those are separate from any legislation changes they may consider?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Alex, this is Sean. A good question with a whole lot of speculation around it. And whether the impact would be on affordable homes specifically or more of the market rate homes that are subject to rent stabilization because of the 421-a program, I suspect anything that would be related to the 421-a program, given the fact it's already occurred over that, would probably be very difficult to get through. And that's what would impact potentially our portfolio.","It wouldn't impact it in a meaningful way. There's only about 7% of the units in the portfolio that are basically at legal caps at this point in terms of the rents that are allowed. So the impact wouldn't be material. But I wouldn't suspect that that would happen, given everything we've been through on the 421-a program over the last few years in New York.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. But if they change and do away with vacancy decontrol, you don't think that that would impact you or that could impact you?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","It depends on what they're talking about in terms of the population of units that would be impacted by any change, whether it's affordable units or just the stabilized units, because you're into these different programs in New York that you have to work through. So I'd be surprised if it was on the market rate units that are subject to stabilization because of 421-a, as opposed to technically affordable units that are set aside that are different.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","So there's a lot of speculation around this, but there's nothing substantial that's actually being drafted or negotiated. So I think we'd likely be okay, but even if something came through that affected the piece that we'd be worried about, it wouldn't be a material impact on the assets.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thank you, Sean.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.","John Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC","Thanks. On Columbus Circle, if you had kept it or if you do keep it for rental, what was the unlevered IRR expectation over the long-term for this site?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hi, John. We typically don't provide disclosure on projected long-term IRRs, but I think we gave a sense that we thought the economics here on a development basis were in the mid-4% range, including the retail. So you'd have to sort of kind of \u2013 you can probably input your own assumptions there in terms of growth and reversion at cap rates, as to what that would translate into an unlevered IRR.","John Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC","Yeah. Understood. Could you share the contracted retail rents per foot and what's under negotiation? How does that compare, how will it compare to initial underwriting?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, John. It's Matt. Yeah. We're not going to disclose what the actual rents were in the lease. But as I did mention, the two deals that we have either signed or very close to being signed are both at or better than the economics we had underwritten both in terms of rent and also in terms of TIs and free rent. So, so far, we're tracking a little ahead of our program. Obviously, we still have a lot of space left to lease.","John Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC","Okay. That helps. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The final question will come from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Hi, everyone. Just want to go back to those East Bay developments. I think you mentioned you had a $40 million cost overrun. But when I look at Avalon Public Market and Avalon Walnut Creek, it looks like the cost went up $30 million. So, did the subcontractor eat the $10 million? And then if you have costs locked-in ahead of time for the developments, was this driven by increased labor costs or did the whole thing just had to be reworked?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Wes. It's Matt. You're right. What we recognized this quarter across those two projects compared to last quarter was $30 million higher. To be fair, there was an additional $10 million in cost increases we had already recognized on Emeryville, if you go back to the very beginning when we first started the projects. So, relative to what we thought what our initial budgets were, that's where the $40 million came from.","And you're right in that, normally, 90-plus-percent of the time when we start a project we have, most of the trade costs locked-in with subcontractors who perform. And consequently that's why if you look at that slide, over a long, long period of time, we're generally bringing projects in within 1% of budget plus or minus. This is the kind of environment in Northern California, particularly right now, kind of one market once every cycle where you see \u2013 while you thought you had your costs locked-in, the subcontractors failed to perform.","You force them to build it. If they're not making money doing it, they thought they could get labor at a certain price, they couldn't. One of those deals in Walnut Creek we had a further complication which was it's a public-private deal with BART as the ground lessor and there were some prevailing wage requirements which in turn created additional union requirements for the execution that we were not expecting there. So, that was a piece of it as well.","But, generally, we are very successful in locking down our costs at the start. But there are extreme situations and this would be one of them where the subcontractors just won't perform and you basically have to switch, find new subs at whatever the prevailing market price at that time is.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Wes, maybe just to add a couple of general comments. I think they do apply to what's happened in the East Bay. And as you get late in the cycle like this where we have a lot of production going on, I mentioned earlier just the lack of skilled labor, they are adding skilled labor, but it's oftentimes not as productive, not as good, and just the market is so stretched that the margin for errors is just very low. So, there if one sub fails, it tends to have a cascading effect on all the subs behind them.","So, in a normal market, sometimes if one sub fails, you can oftentimes replace them quickly without an impact to schedule or cost to the other subs. That's not this kind of market right now, particularly in Northern California, just a very low margin of error, and something that we're trying to be mindful of from a risk standpoint at this point in the cycle, so.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then last one for me. We obviously just heard Sears filed bankruptcy and we're hearing from a lot of the retail landlords that this can unlock some densification opportunities. So, have you noticed an uptick in inbound calls to Avalon looking at potential multi-family on retail sites?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","John, we've actually \u2013 I'm sorry, Wes, that's something we've been working on for a while. And, in fact, the deal I mentioned, the new dev right this quarter which is at the Alderwood Mall outside of Seattle, that is actually a former Sears box. So we're working with GGP on it but actually Seritage is in the deal as well.","And we assigned a fairly senior development person to kind of work on those opportunities really about a year or two ago. So we continue to talk to mall owners, to retail owners, and we do view that as a great opportunity for us. I don't think there's anything \u2013 we're not seeing any more specifically because of the Sears bankruptcy yet, and frankly, a lot of those locations are not locations that we're going to be all that interested in but, as a general macro trend, absolutely.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Tim Naughton for closing remarks.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thank you, Brandon. And thanks for all of you being on today and look forward to seeing you in the near future. Take care.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the AvalonBay Communities Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley - Senior Director of Investor Relations","Thank you, Augusta, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities second quarter 2016 earnings conference call.","Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially.

The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, thanks, Jason, and welcome to our second quarter call. With me today is Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin, and Matt Birenbaum. I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night, and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.","My comments will focus on providing a summary of Q2 and year-to-date results, our revised midyear outlook for 2016, our view regarding the trajectory and durability of the current apartment cycle, and lastly, a look at how current development activity is contributing to our earnings growth.","So, starting on slide four, it was a solid quarter where we achieved core FFO growth greater than 8.5% from a combination of healthy same-store revenue and NOI growth of 5% and contributions from new lease-ups as we completed almost $200 million at a projected yield of just under 7%. Year-to-date, core FFO was up over 10%, again, driven by a combination of internal growth from the stabilized portfolio and external growth from stabilizing development. For the first half of the year, our same-store portfolio performed in line with budget, although a bit ahead of budget in Q1 and a little behind in Q2. I'll discuss this trend a little more in a couple of minutes.","Turning to slide five and our updated outlook for the year, in short, overall expectations for core FFO are in line with our original outlook which called for core FFO growth of 9%. Our projection for same-store NOI growth has been trimmed by about 40 basis points or approximately $0.03 per share for the full year but is offset by contributions from other categories. That said, our full year outlook for core FFO remains unchanged. Projected investment and funding activity for the year remains more or less in line with our original expectation with some minor variances.","Turning now to slide six, we thought we'd provide a little more color regarding our outlook for the same-store portfolio in the second half of the year. As I mentioned earlier, we performed in line with expectations for the first half of the year, although in Q2, we did not experience the seasonal strength and effective rent growth that we're accustomed to seeing.","This trend appears to be largely demand-driven as economic and job growth fell short of expectations for the first half of the year, and declining business confidence and investment no doubt was a contributing factor as recent uncertainty and global events have left businesses hesitant to make new commitments.","Turning to slide seven, slower economic growth impacts corporate and transient demand, which helps fuel seasonal strength in the second and third quarters for our business. A weaker corporate and transient demand affects us in two ways; first, a reduction in premium income, which typically runs 50% to 60% higher per lease; and secondly, an effective increase in market vacancy as, in effect, inventories essentially added back to the market.","Turning to slide eight. As economic conditions have moderated over the last two quarters to three quarters, effective rent growth in our same-store portfolio expressed as like-term rent change has remained in the 4% range over the last six months to seven months. And while like-term rent change did improve modestly in Q2, we did not see the same seasonal lift we've seen in prior years so far this cycle.","And turning to slide nine, of course, performance does vary across our regions. The fact that rent growth has moderated, most notably in Northern California and the Northeast, while Seattle and the Mid-Atlantic have been trending up, rent growth in Southern California remains healthy in the 6% range.","Turning to slide 10, as you might expect, these trends are impacting our outlook for portfolio performance for the year. Again, the Northeast and Northern California has fallen short of projected budget, while Seattle and D.C. are expected to outperform. Overall, the net impact is resulting in a reduction of same-store revenue of almost 40 basis points for the full year with all of that expected shortfall to occur in the second half of the year.","Turning now to slide 11, just given trends in the operating environment, we thought we'd just revisit where we think we are in the cycle. We still believe that fundamentals point mostly in favor of an extended cycle, much like we saw in the 1990s. As you can see on this chart, consumer confidence remains on solid footing at cyclically high levels, and young adults are feeling the best and leading the way.","Turning to slide 12, consumer confidence is being shaped in large part by an improved employment picture, with jobless claims continuing their fall since the cycle began and job openings now outpacing hiring activities.","And as you could see on slide 13, the growing strength in the labor market seems to finally be putting pressure on wages as evidenced by recent ADP reports. And combined with reduced debt burden and stronger balance sheet you can see on chart two, the consumer is in good shape and getting stronger, which bodes well for continued economic growth given their contribution to the GDP.","Turning to slide 14, in addition, renter demand should continue to be supported by favorable demographics, with the largest segment of Millennials in their early to mid-20s still moving into their prime household formation and renting years. Obviously, demographics have been a major driver of renter demand this past cycle and they continue to support healthy renter demand over the next five-plus years even if homeownership rates begin to stabilize as a leading edge of Millennials begin to consider buying a home.","Turning to slide 15, the supply side of the equation is encouraging as well. Apartment deliveries are expected to peak nationally in 2016 and 2017 as permitting for new projects has slowed down over the last two quarters to three quarters from the cyclical highs in 2015. This is due in part to tightening credit from multi-family construction which has become much more pronounced over the last couple of quarters.","Turning to slide 16, in addition to the apartment sector remaining in balance, the picture for the overall housing market looks positive as well. Our projections for new housing production are in line with household formation over the next four years. But it's important to note that, first, these figures, the supply figures ignore obsolescence or destruction of roughly 400,000 units per year. And they also assume that housing production over the next four years increases by 30% from its current level and roughly doubles what we've seen so far on average this cycle.","So overall, while we may be seeing economic growth moderate a bit, we don't see any real tangible side that the apartment or housing cycle was nearing its end. Rather, we are still seeing solid demand growth matched by what we believe is reasonable levels of new supply to meet that demand.","Turning to slide 17, within this operating environment, one where demand and supply are expected to remain in balance, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue to deliver outsized growth from our development platform. So far this cycle, we've completed over $4 billion of new development at initial stabilized yields on average of around 7% are well in excess of our marginal cost of capital during this time which has contributed to strong core FFO growth over the last few years.","And finally, turning to slide 18, development should continue to drive solid external growth going forward as development underway along with non-stabilized recent completions to generate another $200 million of NOI with less than $400 million of capital required to complete this basket of $3.3 billion of assets.","With these assets projected to yield well above our marginal cost of capital, most of which has already been raised, we are positioned to deliver industry-leading external growth over the next two years to three years.","So, in summary, 2016 is shaping up to be another strong year for AvalonBay, and we believe that the company is very well-positioned from an investment and funding perspective to outperform going forward.","And with that, Augusta, we'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. This question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. We'll go first to Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Given the more muted near-term 2016 operating outlook, does it give you any pause in terms of development starts in the back half of the year?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Nick, this is Tim. No, not really. I mean, I would kind of point to the last few charts and talking about where we think we are in the cycle. We think the cycle still has room to run, the economic cycle and more broadly the housing cycle and the apartment cycle.","So what would give us pause if we thought the cycle was maybe nearing its end and the cost of capital was \u2013 that we need in order to fund those commitments change dramatically. But in terms of the expected yields on that basket of communities relative to what we think we can fund them at, we think it still provides an attractive accretive growth. So at this point, I'd say no.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And then just in terms of the markets, maybe one that surprised on the negative and one on the positive. Can you talk about what you're seeing in New England and then in the Pacific Northwest?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes, sure, Nick, it's Sean. Happy to talk about that. In terms of New England, first, it's typically more seasonal than most of our markets. And if you look at what's happened throughout the year, rent change started the year in the mid-2% range and has trended up to about 3.5%. But it's running well below both last year's rate of about 5% and our initial expectations.","And I think it's largely a result of two things. One is job growth in the first five months or six months of the year has been somewhat disappointing at an annualized rate of about 1.5% relative to expectations, closer to about 2% for the full year. And then also the transient demand that Tim referred to has been pretty weak in Boston this year, which put downward pressure on rental rates in the late spring and the early summer. So in terms of New England, that's kind of what's happening there.","And as it relates to Seattle, Seattle, for the most part, is all about demand. And in the first half of the year, job growth is running in the mid-4% range. I think most forecasters that we rely on had projected a slowdown in hiring in the Seattle market and it has not slowed down. There's still plenty of supply, about 3.5% of inventory, but the surprise has been on the demand side in terms of job growth.","There's still softness in the sort of urban core of Seattle. We don't have many assets there. We really have two operating assets in those submarkets. But if you move out to the north end, and you move to Redmond, you move to Bellevue, revenue growth is still relatively robust.","And I think the difference between Seattle and Northern California in terms of what you're seeing in performance is you really have some well-established, large, well-capitalized companies driving the hiring in the tech sector in Seattle as compared to a lot of the smaller businesses that make up a greater share of employment in Northern California that are more susceptible to changes in funding tied to the D.C. market and what's happening with IPO valuations, et cetera. So that's really what's been helping Seattle. It's really the job growth.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And then just finally, looks like bad debt increased. Could you talk about what drove that increase and if it was in any specific markets?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. Did you say bad debt, Nick, just so I get you clearly?","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. No, bad debt was up about 15 basis points year-over-year. We are seeing elevated levels of bad debt across four of the six regions. About 60% of it, though, is coming from a combination of factors in the New York region, really three things that I could point to. One, is the core process is slow considerably in 2016 relative to 2015, so it's taking a lot longer to get sort of judgment if you want to call it that. And our policy is to write things off after a certain period of time, if we collect it later, it will be an offset, but we're running things off more rapidly. And then secondly is we're just not getting the same level of judgments that we were seeing based on some new judges in certain courts.","And then thirdly is we did have one corporate housing provider kind of go belly up on us. It was only 15 homes but it represented a couple of months of rent. The underlying client was actually still paying so it's sort of an anomaly in the system I guess I would say. But New York is about 60% of the total increase, so that (16:45).","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. So a quick question here on the New York\/New Jersey region. It does seem that the revised projection is not meaningfully below the original projection, but somewhat below. So could you break down what you're seeing in the different submarkets, whether it's Manhattan or Brooklyn or even the outlying suburbs and just where you're seeing pockets of strength or weakness on either the supply or demand side there?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure, Rich, this is Sean again. Happy to do so. First, overall for New York\/New Jersey, just to give you a sense of how it's trended throughout the year across that portfolio, rent change increased from about 1.5% in Q1 to roughly 3% for Q2. And while we've had a good progress on renewal rent change, which is in the low 4% range, move-in rent change remains pretty stubbornly low at around 1.5%. It hasn't really improved much through the second quarter or into July. And I think what you're seeing there, particularly in New York City, which I'm including Northern New Jersey in kind of this general description of the geography at this point, is while there's been steady job growth, there's just not enough high-paying jobs being created to absorb all the new supply that's all being delivered at the high end of the market.","And if you look at the performance, particularly recent performance, the suburban markets in and around New York are performing better than the city. We're seeing rent growth in New York City that's sort of in the mid-2% range. But as you move into Long Island and Northern and Central New Jersey, we get up to the 3% to 4% and even 5% in Central Jersey over the last quarter. So, in general, I'd say the supply is weighing most heavily on the New York City market, so including the boroughs in Northern New Jersey, and we're seeing better performance out of the suburban submarkets.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","All right, Sean, that's helpful. And then one also final question on property tax increases. I know that they were up 9% for the quarter. I guess if you could pinpoint this, when can we expect that trend to sort of taper off a little bit, or do you think we're sort of just in for consistent mid-single-digit to high single-digit growth for a little while here?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. Really it's the taxes. The second quarter and the first half are really a reflection of prior year activity, for the most part. About 2\/3 of the increase in taxes relates to supplemental assessments that were reversed last year in the second quarter. Our expectation is that by the time we get to year-end, taxes will probably be growing on a year-over-year basis in the 4% range, 3.5% to 4% range.","So there's a lot of noise in there in terms of the appeal to whether we achieve something this quarter what we received in the same quarter last year, et cetera sort of muddies the comps a little bit, but call it 3.5% to 4% is the expected growth rate in Texas for the calendar year 2016.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. First question, it looked like turnover for the whole portfolio was up a little bit, hoping you could put a little color behind the markets if you're seeing any markets vary materially from that trend?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. I mean, if you look at it, it's a little bit of (20:21) I would say. It's basically 61% this year and last year in the same quarter. And if you look at turnover as a percentage of expirations, because expirations do move around a little bit, turnover was actually down about 100 basis points. So, the only market where there's anything to note is that Pacific Northwest was up about 300 basis points year-over-year. It's sort of to be expected given the nature of the rent increases that we're achieving in that market that turnover's up. So other than that, for the most part, relatively benign change in turnover on a year-over-year basis.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay. And then, how about concessions? Are you seeing any shift in concessions and particularly, I guess, in Northern California and in the New York City or any increased prevalence of concessions?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. There definitely is, I'd say, a trend of increased concessions primarily in the New York City market and in San Francisco. Those are probably the two places that you're seeing at. And for the most part, I think it's a direct reflection of just the lease-up activity that we're seeing in those markets. So, in both San Francisco and particularly in Manhattan, there's a fair amount of concessions at the lease-up communities. And then the stabilized assets do tend to compete based on those price points, so in many cases or market-to-market rents, but in some cases where you think it might be an aberration for a short period of time, we might use the concession as opposed to reducing the rent, particularly in New York when you're faced with communities that have legal rent caps and things like that you're trying to manage with.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay. And then just lastly, as you look at your second half outlook, and I believe there's 3% to 4% revenue growth outlook, what would the pace look like through the years? Do you see the third quarter and fourth quarter relatively similar? Or do you see a shift in momentum as you exit the year?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. I mean, what's implied by the revised outlook is high-3% range in terms of revenue growth in the second half. Expect it to be slightly above that in the third quarter and slightly below that in the fourth quarter.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay. Perfect. Okay. Thank you, guys.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure.","Operator","We'll go next to Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just up until this point really, the weakness that we've talked about has really been supply-driven and this is one of the first references I recall of being more on the demand side. So I guess I'm just curious aside from \u2013 you mentioned New England being one of the markets where job growth has come in below expectations. What other markets are you seeing demand sort of weaker than you initially expected? And then what gives you the confidence with, I guess, greater uncertainty in the world and the election upcoming that things could reaccelerate or level out?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. I could speak to maybe some of the near-term things, and then Tim might want to speak to sort of the broader cycle, which I think is what he referenced in his prepared remarks in terms of acceleration or deceleration, but in terms of current trends, as Tim mentioned, job growth overall is running below expectations across the country. I'd say with the exception of what we're seeing in terms of acceleration in the Mid-Atlantic and the Pacific Northwest, most of the other markets are slightly below expectations in terms of job growth for this year. So given the level of supply which was anticipated and reduced job growth, that's where you see us falling short a little bit in terms of our expectations for revenue growth in the second half of the year.","But in terms of the broader outlook, Tim could probably reference some thoughts on that.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Just to be clear, I wasn't calling for an acceleration of fundamentals. What I was saying is we believe that the cycle is not done and we're not actually going to see a continued deceleration. I think the one charge, we've seen like-term rent change be right in the 4% range now for the last six months or seven months. That's a period of time when we have seen weaker economic activity than we have anticipated. And I think job growth has been off about 50 basis points from what we had projected and I just think when there's just less economic activity and job growth, you're going to have a little less household formation.","But having said that, as we said in our management letter, we do expect rent change to be in the 3% to 4% range for the balance of the year. That is at or above trend, long-term trend. That is still very healthy rent growth for our business. So we're not necessarily calling for reacceleration to cyclical highs, but we don't think it's over yet. And, again, it's one of the reasons why we compare it to the 1990s.","If you go back to the 1990s and you just sort of chart what rent growth and revenue growth look like, it moved around from year-to-year based upon what was happening in that particular year from an economic activity standpoint. It does ebb and flow a bit, and that's just the way economies work.","But we don't see the kind of distortions that you might expect to see. You see some weakness, but you don't see the kind of distortions that you might expect to see that results in a lot of dislocation and ultimately leads to negative economic growth of recession.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I appreciate the detail there. And then you kind of touched a little bit on Southern California and I was just curious, that was a market that was sort of trending ahead of expectations early in the year. And now you're calling for things to soften into the second half of next year and didn't really highlight it as an outperformer versus your initial projections. Can you just give a little detail as to what's driving some of that softness into the second half of the year and then maybe a little detail by submarket would be helpful.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. This is Sean. On that topic, basically Southern California as you pointed out slightly ahead in the first half, it's basically slightly behind in the second half as a function of the macroeconomic things that we spoke about in terms of job growth, et cetera. The supply is pretty much as expected.","And so I don't know that there's a great story in Southern California in terms of whether it's a deceleration other than the job environment. I mean if you look at it, we had a little bit of a boost in the Los Angeles region particularly San Fernando Valley in the first half of the year as a result of just a one-off issue which was a gas leak in that area that drove some initial demand in the first quarter boosted occupancy but we've given that back in the second quarter.","So there was a little bit of a lift in the first quarter and first half as a result of that. So that's partly reflected in a deceleration I guess if you want to call it as you look to second half relative to the first half. But it's basically performing on plan. Los Angeles is healthy. Orange County has been slightly choppy but still relatively healthy. You've got some supply coming into Anaheim, Irvine and Huntington Beach creates a little bit of choppiness, but for the most part that product is being absorbed. And then San Diego just continues to perform quite well.","So, I don't know that there's any unusual story coming out of Southern California other than slightly lower job growth and then the sort of one-time boost that we received in the first half of the year from the gas leak that occurred.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking the questions.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Kris Trafton with Credit Suisse.","Kris R. Trafton - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I'm just following up on Jordan's (sic) [Austin's] (28:03) question. Given that we're expecting deliveries to peak this year in markets outside New York and job growth continues around 150,000 pace a month, not looking for 2017 guidance, but is your thought that revenue growth could potentially bottom at the end of this year?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll just go back to my earlier comments. I think revenue growth can move around for the balance of the cycle. It's very different than what we saw in the 2000s where rents went up, and then when they stopped going up, they went down. So far this cycle, I think you even saw in those two charts that we put up, one that showed the entire portfolio and one that showed the six regions.","Even after you sort of neutralize for seasonality, rents have moved around a bit even this cycle, and we're saying we think that we're going to continue to see that a bit. Having said all that, we do see demand and supply becoming more in balance, which means we think we're going to get \u2013 we're moderating towards trend right now or a little bit above trend.","Kris R. Trafton - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Perfect. And then just going back to one of your slides on the job openings versus job hire slide, I mean, given like the protection of sentiment kind of in the United States and less likely to import foreign labor and the skills gap that we have here in the United States, do you think that that gap between openings and hires may kind of stick around for a while? And then do you give it any thought in terms of how that may affect demand in kind of your major markets?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I think it's a fair question. I mean, particularly as you get into college grads and highly skilled positions as you mentioned that there could be a shortage and what that does is it creates more income growth for a big part of our resident population which one of the things that we said we really need to have as the cycle gets longer to help continue to kind of support kind of rent growth that we've been seeing. So I think potentially it's a favorable trend for our business maybe not more probably for the economy but for the apartment business and the kind of markets that we're in.","Kris R. Trafton - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Spector with Bank of America.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Can you hear me?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, great. Sorry about that. Good morning. I don't think this question was addressed, but if it was, please let me know. On the supply point, you mentioned in your management letter, you talk about supply averaging approximately 2% of your markets in 2016 and 2017. When we look at different sources of supply, and I know it's still hard to figure out for 2017, it seemed like there is some differentiation between, let's say, San Fran and New York City. But based on your comment, I wasn't sure if you feel like San Fran is going to stay elevated into 2017, because I think we were looking at stats that were showing a drop loss in, let's say, the Northern California area in 2017 versus New York is going to persist at least through 2017.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes, Jeff, this is Sean. A fair comment. I think if you look at it based on the way we look at our markets, which is different from the U.S. overall, we're not as heavily involved in scrutinizing supply in those markets. But in our footprint, we're expecting the Northern California region to decelerate slightly from 2016 to 2017 from about 2.5% to 2.2%. But if you look at San Francisco specifically, we're expecting it to increase again in 2017 from 3.1% of inventory in 2016 to 3.4% in 2017. So you do need to look at the composition of the different markets within that region to determine what's happening.","And then as it relates to New York, we are expecting that to continue to be an issue through 2017. As you may know, in New York, 15 deliveries were about 1.5% of inventory. It's up to about 3% now. And when you get to 2017, it's expected to peak closer to about 3.5% of inventory in the New York market.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. So in San Fran, you are expecting, in 2017, an increase. What's the disconnect, let's say, between what you're projecting versus, let's say \u2013 I believe you guys look at the \u2013 I think Axiometrics is projecting a decrease. Is it just more of the submarket?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. I think all I can speak to is our process for the most part, and the way we do the process is a little bit top-down and bottoms-up to sort of meet in the middle with our forecast. The top-down sort of comes from other sources, whether it be REITs, Axiometrics or certain local market providers like Delta Associates, as an example here in D.C., or others in other markets. So we take that.","But then we also do sort of a ground-up assessment. We have a market research team here in Arlington that scrubs all the local websites (33:15) municipalities in our market to understand where certain deals are in their processing for entitlement and what the expected delivery dates are. In addition to that, our local development team, where we have three to four people per office around the country, is tracking all the developments in their markets as they're competing for sites and expected opportunities in their markets.","And then in addition to the development teams, the last scrub in our process is through the operations team where they know what's beginning to prelease to better predict when deliveries are expected to arrive in certain submarkets and if we needed to alter our revenue management strategy ahead of deliveries coming.","So, it's a pretty thorough process from a top-down and a bottoms-up perspective as compared to just looking at the REITs' data and saying, that's what we expect. So I think our process is probably more robust on average, but given our capability and development and how important that is to our business, we just give a lot of scrutiny.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then I just had one question on development yields. In 2Q, yield was higher than I think 1Q year-to-date. Can you talk a little bit about those yields? And I assume that they came in above underwriting expectations.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Sure. This is Matt. I can speak to that. You're talking about the 2Q completion?","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Correct. In your presentation, you talk about the development yields for 2Q. I think it's...","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yes.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yes. We completed three communities in the quarter, and the number is going to move around based on the specific communities, the geography each quarter, and the three we completed this past quarter all beat pro forma pretty handily. One of them was on Capitol Hill in Seattle which is our first asset in that submarket, which had just exceeded expectations obviously with the big run-up in rent since we started that deal two-plus years ago.","Another one was a deal in Northern New Jersey, in Union, which hadn't seen any new supply in many years, and frequently we find a positive surprise on rents when we lease up in communities like that. And the third one was in Irvine. So, the basket moves around from quarter to quarter, but I think year-to-date it's in the kind of 6.3%-ish (35:48) range. So, obviously as we completed the prior quarter with all the lower yielding, some of those were in \u2013 one of those was a large deal in Southern Cal which tends to have lower yields. So, it's going to generally move around. But we're continuing to see yields, obviously, beat the initial underwriting on the strength of good rent.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Good morning. This is Jeff (36:20) on with Andrew. Just to turn to slide eight of the presentation, it looks like much of the setup is like 2013 where your same-store slowed but bottomed at 3.5%. But I'm just curious, if you take this chart, what would it look like in 2001 or 2008 when things were about to fall off a cliff?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I think, I referenced it, they looked \u2013 I don't know if we had this exact data series \u2013 time series certainly for 2001, but if you recall we had a big run-up in 2000 in the apartment world. So we really had a rent spike that was driving pretty phenomenal performance in 2000. And then, with the tech rack (37:17) and the elimination of \u2013 you had two things going. You had the elimination obviously of a lot of technology jobs and you had a pretty \u2013 a much more dramatic expansion of monetary policy in terms of the impact on interest rates. So you had a lot more homeownership rates went up in the face of recession which was unusual. So you had a lot more demand destruction in the case of rental housing than you did actually in the 2000s where you had job losses that were actually three times what we had in the early 2000s.","But we saw sort of the typical pattern where ownership rates actually went up during recession. So, as I mentioned earlier, in the 2000s, it's a little bit more of a kind of a straight-up and then straight-down curve to rent growth. But it kind of kept going up and then (38:15). And then after about 2006 into 2007, rent started to decelerate until 2008 hit us.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then also, if you looked at cap rates by region, where do you believe the lowest and highest cap rates are in your portfolio?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","This is Matt. I guess I'll speak to that one. Lowest cap rates are still probably Manhattan. Kind of core best locations in Manhattan are probably still free caps. But outside of that, I would say generally speaking, the lowest cap rates are across the Southern California right now. I don't think a lot has been trading in Northern California recently just be it the changes on the ground there.","So we've been trying to buy in Southern California, and it's been a little bit frustrating. Good, newer products in Southern Cal in infill submarkets is definitely trading sub-4% cap rate. And then the rest of the markets are kind of low 4%s to mid-4%s up to mid-5%s depending on where you are.","Unknown Speaker","Great. That's helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. If I look at page nine of your slides where you give the rent change by market, while your market seem like they're just sort of fluctuating over a five-year average, but the chart that looks scarier there is Northern California which looks like it's in sort of freefall since last year, but maybe even reaching a bottom line on your five-year history. So what was the first half of this year like-term rent change in San Francisco and what are you assuming for the second half of the year? And maybe you can break down the performance of the markets a bit between San Francisco versus the East Bay and San Jose.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes, Nick. This is Sean. Why don't I try to address some of those comments and we can always follow up with greater detail if you're interested. Why don't I give you a sense that in Northern California, first, to give you some perspective from an overall standpoint, rent change started the year around 6%, but it continued to decelerate and is currently running around 4%, and that's made up of about 2.5% in San Francisco, 6% in the East Bay and a low 4% range in San Jose. So that's kind of where we are now.","If you want to kind of decompose that even more into the new move-ins and like-term rent change by market, why don't I get that to you separately so we don't consume a lot of time on that. But I think it's fair to say that San Francisco is probably the softest at this point so just to address that one. Rent change at this point on move-ins is essentially just barely positive, 50 basis points to 100 basis points kind of range. We continue to hold renewals sort of in the low 4% to mid-4% range. So you're talking about anywhere from 2.5% to 3.5% sort of numbers on a blended basis in San Francisco. This number is certainly better in East Bay and San Jose, as I mentioned currently.","But in terms of it, reaching a bottom and flattening out, as I mentioned in response to a prior question, we still expect continued deliveries at a pretty heavy level in San Francisco throughout this year and then even increasing into next year.","So performance, really rent change is going to depend on the level of demand and job growth has been decelerating there. So to the extent that we see job growth level off, that would certainly help. But I think really your forecast for job growth is going to dictate performance in 2017 and whether that levels off or not certainly as you get beyond 2017. Given the nature of the product that's constructed in San Francisco, supply should start to fall off, but we do expect it to be somewhat challenging through 2017 in San Francisco specifically. So...","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. I guess just specifically the second half of 2016, is it going to be \u2013 your guidance is assuming it's worse than the 4% you've done in the first half of the year?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","That's correct.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. But no specific number?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","In terms of that specific market, I can give you some general ranges in terms of what we're expecting in the third quarter and fourth quarter. I mean, Northern California, we're probably talking about more in the 3%, 3.5% range, somewhere in that ballpark for all three markets combined.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's great.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. The weakest is going to be in San Francisco. But keep in mind, I said Northern California is more like 6% in the first quarter and then 5% in the second quarter, so, it continues to trend down. The 4% I mentioned was more of kind of where we are currently.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So, going back to the East Coast, the Brooklyn development project that's underway, how is the lease-up doing particularly I'm interested in the Avalon component which I know just started leasing as the higher rent piece of the project. Any changes to how you're thinking about concessions there and the ultimate yield on the entire project? Thanks.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. This is Sean again. Yes, Willoughby and \u2013 Avalon Willoughby and AVA DoBro have been performing quite well as you indicated. We're just starting to lease up on the Willoughby component. But if you look at performance through the second quarter, which represents mainly AVA DoBro, we lease and occupy 65, 60 a month which is quite strong and up from the first quarter which was around 39. So, leasing velocity has been healthy.","Yes, as I indicated, it's a little too early probably to give you correct guidance about the Willoughby component. We did mark the rents up this quarter, but our expectation is that hopefully there'll be some additional lift as we move through the second half of the year. The views are pretty spectacular at the top of that building. So I'm not sure that we have seen exactly where the rents are going to settle out.","But I think it's fair to say the overall project has performed quite well. In terms of the impact on yield, the only negative I can speak to is that we have had a little bit of a surprise on the property tax side that may offset some of the rent lift. But our expectation is that the yield would be essentially on par with original expectations hopefully slightly above.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. I was hoping to talk about LA. My understanding of your portfolio is that you have very little exposure to Downtown LA where there's quite a bit of supply coming over the next couple of years. I was hoping you could speak to whether or at least tangentially if there was any impact from Downtown LA supply in some of your submarkets in the second quarter.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes, Drew, this is Sean. You're correct. We have one operating asset in Downtown LA. It's in Little Tokyo, a community we constructed at the earlier part of the cycle, actually have great bases there. But, yes, there's a significant amount of supply being delivered into LA. I think it's upwards of 15% of inventory. You have to put that number in context with the fact that they're trying to create a whole new environment in downtown and it's spread across multiple submarkets within Downtown LA.","But in terms of any indirect effect on the rest of the portfolio from that supply, we have not seen that. Most of the product that we own in that market is a mix of some newer communities, but also a fair amount of older communities in terrific suburban locations that are performing quite well.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. You also mentioned markets like Huntington Beach and Irvine, for instance, that are seeing a decent amount of supply just in Southern California. What does that supply growth trajectory look like going into next year? Is there a fairly sizable deceleration in supply, or do you expect some continued pressure there?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","In those specific submarkets you're referring to or just in the market overall?","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, LA and Orange County, generally.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. I mean LA and Orange County, if you look at the supply that's coming on line, for the most part, we do expect continued elevated deliveries in Downtown LA. It's like 14%, 15% this year and it stays at that level through 2017. The other couple of pockets that you're seeing supply in LA is really Marina del Rey. In particular, there's one large development there at Playa Vista that's delivering right now and then a couple of other submarkets. As you move down in Orange County, you do see supply fall off a little bit in Anaheim from 2016 to 2017.","And as it relates to Irvine, Irvine is actually projected to increase some as you move into 2017 as a result of some deliveries by a handful of developers, but in particular a couple of large projects that will be delivered by the Irvine Company. So increase there.","And then a modest reduction in Huntington Beach, and in Huntington Beach, there's kind of two anchors to the supply. There's a fair amount of product being delivered right at the mall at Beach Boulevard and the 405, but there's other communities, a couple of large communities under development down at Pacific City, which is down along Pacific Coast Highway there in Huntington Beach. So, there's not much sort of in between there, but those are the two sort of anchors of supply in that market.","So if you look at it, though, overall, one thing to keep in mind for Southern California is we're still talking about deliveries that are low 1% range of inventory overall. So you do have to be careful about which submarkets you're in, but if you look at it, the region is pretty supply-constrained.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank has our next question.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, everyone. I jumped on a little late, so I apologize if I missed this. But just in thinking about the underperformance of job growth year-to-date versus your original expectations, did you guys mention what the outlook for job growth is in the second half for your portfolio?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We did not, we did not. We really just spoke to the shortfall so far this year which is about 50 basis points less than we had anticipated. That's nationally. And then, if you look at our markets, I think it's probably roughly in line with that in terms of the overall shortfall so far this year.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","And just one other point to comment on, Vin, I think our projection for the full year now at this point is about 2.5 million jobs, and originally we're well north of that for the full calendar year.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Okay. I'm just trying to get a sense if you're expecting things to sort of stabilize here at current levels or maybe decelerate a little bit further. I guess any color you could provide there.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Vin, so let me just speak. What happened in the first half here is what's really going to impact the portfolio performance in the second half of the year. So that's all. We're not really all that \u2013 we're not as focused in terms of the \u2013 what happened in the second half of the year in terms of job growth will really play more into our 2017 outlook than the back half of 2016. You should see about a two-quarter lag impact in terms of what's happening in terms of the direction of job growth relative to the portfolio.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that clarity. And then, just another question, just in terms of looking at the like-term effective rent change's around 4% so far this year. Expect it to maybe moderate a little bit in the back half. But if we look at the first half same-store revenue growth, it's been a bit higher, maybe 100 basis points higher than that. And it looks like the July data, there's a narrowing of that gap, and I'm just curious if there's anything specific that's driving that. Is it folks trading down or just different lease term lengths than you've seen typically and just any color you have on that?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. I mean, what comes to mind is really comps. I mean in the second half of the year, certainly, we have more challenging comps, and it's really played out in terms of \u2013 if you look at granular level, it really comes down to the monthly sequential change in GP. And what we've seen in both like-term rent change, as well as the transient and corporate component, it's just not compounding as great a rate as it was at this time last year.","So, to give you some perspective, as an example, if you look at the change in GP on a monthly basis, last year, we're talking about through the second quarter, on a monthly basis, moving up at 60 basis points in April, 100 basis points in May, and about 110 basis points in June. Versus this year, those numbers were 30 basis points, 60 basis points, and 90 basis points.","Some of that is a reflection of the transient demand that we mentioned earlier, Tim alluded to in his prepared remarks, which does sort of turbo-charge GP growth in the late second quarter and early third quarter that we're not seeing this year. So that's certainly part of it.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","...lease growth, and how does that compare to the prior year?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","I'm sorry, Conor. I think we got the tail end of your question. Would you mind restating?","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Yes. Yes. 2Q in July, new lease growth and how those compared to last year.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. 2Q move-in rent change is 2.6%, and last year at this time, we were doing \u2013 hang on one second, I'll tell you the exact number for 2Q, it was running in the mid-4%s. And then you said July? You're looking at July as well? Is that the question (53:11)?","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Yes. Yes, sir.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","So, July move-in rent change is running to 8%. And last year, actually, I don't have last year right off the top of my head here, Conor. I'll get back to you on that detail.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then what was the initial year cap rate on the Tustin sale?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Tustin sale, this is Matt. Let me just look that one up for you, Conor. I think it was in the low \u2013 if I can find that.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","And maybe while you're looking for that, Tim, what was the new development site you added in Southern California? The new right.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's in the Arts District.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay. In LA, correct?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Correct. Yes. I'm sorry.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay. So then you have Hollywood \u2013 you have the West Hollywood deal and now the Arts District deal there. Those are your two Southern California rights, correct?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yes. There's a West Hollywood that's under construction. There's Hollywood which has a development right, which is three quarters a mile down Santa Monica, so it's Hollywood and Arts District. Correct.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yes. This is Matt. It looks like East Tustin was 4.9% cap rate, call it.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","4.9%, and is that on \u2013 that's on about $400 a door of CapEx, correct?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","There might have been a little more deferred CapEx that's not included in that number.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Frankly, if you put in some of the CapEx (54:48) the cap rate would be lower.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill has the next question.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning down there. Just two quick ones from me. First, on the outperformance that obviously helped this year's guidance number and has sort of been of a hallmark for you guys, the 30 basis points. As fundamentals moderate, how should we be thinking about that outperformance? Is that something that you expect to continue, or eventually, maybe if not in the next six months, maybe in the next 12 months where trend is going, you'll just be delivering at your underwriting rather than exceeding?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Alex, I mean, as you know, I mean, we do underwrite based upon current rents in place. As long as rents continue to rise at some level, we would expect yields to continue to go up, all other things being constant which, for the most part, they are. We generally have been able to bring development in close to budget. So, yes, you would expect that lift to moderate as rents might moderate.","Now, the 30 basis points is a little misleading. If you took out the impact of Willoughby, well Willoughby's rents went up pretty significantly, so did the taxes, as Sean had mentioned. So that's actually due to the impact in terms of the yield impact. If you neutralize for Willoughby, the other deals, on average, have gone up by 70 basis points. So about a 10% lift in terms of the projected yield. So you got to look at the actual basket and some different things that may be happening with individual assets.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","That's helpful, Tim. And then the second is maybe, Kevin, can you just provide a little bit color, I don't think you addressed it earlier, but in the guidance revision, you're getting a lift from capital markets and transaction activity, a $0.02 positive variance versus your original outlook. Can you just provide a little bit more color on what's going in there, what's changed in your thinking of those two items to give you that positive benefit?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Alex, this is Kevin. The $0.02 lift in expected core FFO per share coming from capital markets and transaction activity is as you'd expect. It's a mix of things going on there. It's the impact of net acquisition and disposition activity both in terms of the amount and the timing, as well as some changes to JV income \u2013 I'm sorry, some changes to the debt assumptions that we've got. We did pay off a piece of debt in the second quarter and have some benefit from lower interest rate being woven into the mix here.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. But it's not as if \u2013 because you guys haven't historically drawn your line, I can't remember actually the last time you had drawn in your line. But it is not as though you intend to use more of your line of credit; it is just timing of other activities, correct?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","It's timing of other activity, primarily acquisition and disposition activity, both amount and the timing of it. So yes, we don't expect to be a significant user of our line of credit and we haven't been throughout the year.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on commentary of concessions on stabilized assets. Can you just quantify what percentage of your stabilized portfolio you're offering free month's rent and maybe compare that to last year?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Percentage of the portfolio offering free rent, I'm not sure I have that. I think we can certainly get that back to you. But to give you some sense in terms of absolute dollars on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, cash concessions in the second quarter of 2015 were about $75,000 versus the second quarter of this year were about $300,000 and the greatest increases were in New England, New York, and Northern California markets.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And when you discussed 3% to 4% like-term rental growth in the second half of this year, is that on an effective or nominal basis?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","That's effective. That's a net effective number.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. With your cost of debt declining, have you changed your underwriting hurdles at all on your development pipeline as far as yields or IRR?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yes, hey, John. This is Matt. We do index our target investment returns to our weighted average cost of capital, assuming a 30% to 70% debt to equity mix. So, as the cost of debt goes down, it does at the margin reduce our WACC a little bit, but frankly, it's a lot more impacted by the equity. And we don't adjust it on a day-to-day basis. We'll adjust it maybe twice a year. What we've seen is that it's actually been pretty darn sticky over the last four years or five years really through this entire cycle.","So, I would say, no, in general, our target returns on development have not moved in any material way over the last, really, couple of years. We're still looking at it. And when you look at where the underwriting returns on the development rights are, they've been very consistent in that kind of mid-6% range.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","And, John, this is Kevin. Just to add to that, while Treasury rates have certainly gone down, if you sort of look at our cost of debt for 10-year unsecured debt, last year, we averaged around 3.4%, 3.5%. As you know, in our May offering, we executed just under 3%. If we were to raise, do a 10-year unsecured bond offering today, we'd probably be around 3% because while treasuries have fallen, spreads have widened, essentially neutralizing the Treasury change.","So, even over the last year, there's only been maybe a 40-basis point, 50-basis point decrease in our overall cost of debt. So, when you weave that through on a blended basis at 30% leverage for what Matt alluded to in the underwriting, it's a pretty modest potential impact.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","It seems like it would be higher levered return though on your development? Is that a fair assessment?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","I'm not sure if I follow. We underwrite yields on an unlevered basis. And so what we do is in our yield matrix the component that Matt was alluding to that tied to our short-term cost of capital looks at our unlevered initial short-term cost of capital which ascribes 30% weighting to debt, 70% weighting to equity. And so you end up with having essentially an unlevered or neutralized number there from a leverage point of view. So we don't look at yields on a levered basis.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Quick question from me on the development side of the equation, I'm curious how much of the job occupancies or job openings that you're seeing are driven by construction and if that's having any pressures on construction costs and then it would ultimately impact development yields. And I know you mentioned development yields were probably going to be stable. But I'm curious if you're seeing rising construction costs driven primarily by wage growth on that side.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it has been driven mostly by labor, not by materials for sure. And that's been a mix I would imagine of both profitability and labor cost. If you look at the different sort of wage indices out there, construction labor is towards the top, if not at the very top in terms of year-over-year wage growth. So it's an industry that has seen a lot of skilled labor leave over the last cycle or two. And it's a challenge, it's a challenge to get skilled labor at a lot of these sites compared \u2013 and when you think about the production level, not just of apartments, but just of housing and kind of all real estate categories, the level of construction is still not that high and, yes, it's a real challenge for the industry right now. And I think a lot of that just has to do with the shortage of skilled labor.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And you're pretty comfortable that development yields will remain stable despite that?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we continue to \u2013 whenever we look at new opportunities as well as existing opportunities, we continue to sort of re-underwrite them as we continue to best pursue cost of capital and make sure it's something we want to continue to invest where we think is sort of the highest risk capitals of any deal, which is that entitlement and design that pursue cost of capital, if you will. So the kind of yields that you see on the schedule in the release, they're consistent with the kind of yields we see in the development rights pipeline.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And then, just one more quick question on the financing side, are you actually seeing guys pull back or developers pull back because they haven't been able to get the construction financing that they see or that they used to see?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There's clearly \u2013 I mean part of why we've been able to replenish our development rights pipeline, I think, is connected to that. We are seeing more deal flow. I think there \u2013 if a developer has three or four deals, they may be looking to lay off one of them in terms of land and it's probably a function somewhat of the kind of reception that they're getting with some of their key lending partners.","But across the board, you're definitely hearing from both banks, the suppliers of capital as well as the consumers of capital developers that construction financing is less plentiful.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question, could you talk about rent-to-income ratios in many of your key markets and if you think that's a contributing factor to \u2013 or rent fatigue is a contributing factor to some of the slowdown in rent growth we're seeing? Just want to get a sense of how much of this stuff really is supply-related versus how much is demand-related.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure, Tayo. It's Sean. Yes, rent-to-income ratios are running around 23% right now, so, certainly at the higher end of long-term averages, if you want to think of it that way. We are seeing income growth. Income growth from the portfolio in households that moved in, in the second quarter was up a couple of hundred basis points year-over-year.","In terms of rent fatigue, if you look at the portfolio in terms of reasons for move out, it's actually come down. If you look at rent increases as a percentage of move outs, it was running close to the 20% last year; it's running about 17% right now. And as you might imagine, it's come down a fair bit in markets like New York and Northern California.","So, we're starting to see pretty good signs of wage growth across the economy and in our portfolio and, as you've seen, some deceleration in rental rate growth in some of these markets. There's just not as much pressure there as there was during 2015, as an example.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Helpful. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Looking at the reasons to move out, have you noticed any changes that are material?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","No. Not really. Other than what I've mentioned as it relates to rent increases being down year-over-year, for the most part, it's been pretty stable at the portfolio level. And I wouldn't say there's any significant highlight even at the regional level at this point.","So what you'd expect, for the most part, relocations (67:10) of about 23% to 25% of move-outs, rent increases, as I mentioned, running around 17%, and then home purchases are running at (67:19). It's actually down about 50 basis points year-over-year and still well below long-term averages. So a little bit of movement upward in a couple of markets, but it's not really moving much in terms of the home purchases.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And looking at Exhibit 7, how much did that impact \u2013 or the lower corporate and transient demand impact the overall same-store number for the year when you factor in 2Q and 3Q?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. Wes, it's a little hard to quantify, and I'll tell you why. It's easy to quantify some of the direct effect on the short-term component in particular. So to give you an example, if the percentage of leases that are short-term is down, say, 50 basis points specifically, get a 50% premium on that, a loss of about 25 incremental basis points of GP growth during that period of time.","What's hard to quantify is the indirect effect of having that inventory back into the market. So it's hard to say exactly what the impact is for the full year because of the various assumptions you'd have to make. So it's fairly easily to quantify the three months or four months which we could certainly talk to you about offline, but the broader impact is hard to quantify.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And was that pretty broad-based by the regions, both the corporate and transient or was it just isolated to the East Coast where leasing was a little bit softer?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","No. The corporate component was pretty widespread, probably slightly more pronounced in New York, as an example. And then on the transient piece, also relatively widespread, a bit more acute in New England.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Nick Joseph with Citi.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. It's Michael Bilerman with Nick. I'm curious, just sticking with slide seven, as you think about I don't know whether you track this or not, but was there any change in sort of Airbnb type rentals? Were renters in your apartments accelerating the listing of their apartments or scaling that back as a way to maybe generate income to offset some of the rent expense? Is there anything there that you've been able to discern on the Airbnb front within your portfolio?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Not necessarily, Michael. We do stay connected with Airbnb and they provide us information on leasing activity in our apartment homes. Based on the last report that I saw, there was not a material shift. Some of the stuff that we see is really you have to dissect it at a very granular level to understand it. So for example, in New England, Boston specifically, there were some pretty good winter storms in the last couple of years. When we underwrite things, we sort of look at an average year.","This year was a better than average year, so there were less transient demand from insurance claims for people that had damage in their homes during the winter, I guess to that level of granularity in terms of understanding that demand. So I have not seen anything regarding Airbnb at this point, though.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then when you think about the \u2013 so this captures about 6% of the lease volume of your rent roll between the corporate leasing and the short-term. So the balance, call it about 94%. Is there other categories that we should be mindful of that are either accelerating or deceleration? I don't know how granular you get between students, singles, couples, couples with children and how you dissect all of the data. I'm just curious whether you can share any light on the 94% relative to the 6% you showed here.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. We do dissect the data in terms of the percentage that are single, single with children, married, married with kids, roommates, et cetera. There's not been a significant movement in those numbers. It's a large population, so you'd really have to see in absolute sense quite a bit of movement to move the needle here.","The reason we brought this up is the premiums are so significant on the short-term leases that it can have an impact. Again, when you're talking about a 50% premium even if it's 1% of your leases or 50 basis points or 0.5% of your leases, then it can have a significant impact on GP in any given month. So, that's why we highlighted this one in particular and the same thing in the corporate.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And is there any change in terms of the number of people occupying a home over time that may indicate any shift in terms of affordability that would be noticeable?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","We have not seen that to date, no.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks for the time.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure.","Operator","We have no other questions at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Your host for today's conference is Mr. Jason Reilley, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley","Thank you, Christine and welcome to AvalonBay Communities' second quarter 2015 earnings conference call.","Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There's a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.","As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy Naughton","Yeah. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our second quarter call. Joining me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin, and Matt Birenbaum. We'll each provide some comments on the slides that we posted earlier this morning, and then be available for Q&A afterwards.","Our comments will include and focused on summary of Q2 results and the revised outlook for the full year. We\u2019ll provide an overview of fundamentals and portfolio performance and lastly we\u2019ll touch on development activity and funding.","Starting on Slide 4; overall results in Q2 were better than expected as apartment demand continued to strengthen. As a result of an approving macro-environment along with housing fundamentals that continued to favor rental housing.","Highlights for the quarter include, core FFO growth of 10% or about 250 basis points higher than last quarter, as rent growth continued to improve to the peak leasing season. Year-over-year same store revenue growth was 4.7% for Q2, up about 40 basis points from Q1 and when you include redevelopment that came in at 4.9% on a year-over-year basis. Sequentially revenue growth came in at 2% or 2.1% when you include redevelopment from Q1 and was the strongest sequential growth in Q2s that we've seen since 2010 and one of our strongest second quarters ever.","We completed three communities this quarter totaling $275 million at an average initial yield of 7.3% and started another four communities this quarter totaling about $400 million. Year-to-date starts are right around $0.5 billion and from a funding perspective we are active in the second quarter as well, raising over $600 million through a combination of unsecured debt and asset sales. Much of the capital going to payoff secured debt, which Kevin will touch on later. ","Turning to Slide 5, as a result of stronger fundamentals and increasing operating performance, we\u2019ve updated our projections and outlook for the full year. Core FFO growth per share is now expected to increase 11.1% at the midpoint of our revised range or about 270 basis points above our original outlook from the midpoint. More than half of this increase is coming from our operations and the balance from a combination of favorable capital markets activity and lower interest expense.","Same-store revenue growth is now expected to come in at 2.5% to 5% or about 75 basis points at the midpoint above our original outlook. NOI is expected to come in at about 5% to 5.75% or up over 100 basis points from our original outlook at the mid-point.","Development starts are largely unchanged and more or less on track to start about $1.2 billion this year at share, and capital funding is up about $200 million from what we had originally dissipated, largely to fund additional \u2013 refinance additional secured debt.","Now moving on to Slide 6; this operating environment is benefiting from improved economic conditions. Jobs continue to grow at a pace of north of 200,000 per month with growth increasingly in the mid-to-higher wage jobs.","Our job openings are now outstripping hiring as you see in Chart 2 in the upper right, which combined with our higher-quality jobs is leading to stronger wage growth. As you see in Chart 3 the employer cost from employee comp survey now reflects wage growth north of 4% nationally. When you combine the stronger job picture with lower debt burdens, as shown in Chart 4, this is driving consumer confidence and is providing a strong foundation for a healthy housing market, which is evident when you turn to Slide 7.","Annual net household formations now appear to be recovering from prerecession levels of about \u2013 and are now running at about $1.5 million per year after having languished below $1 million really over the last several years.","Meanwhile, housing starts are not keeping pace as you can see in the upper right coming in at 1 million, maybe just over 1 million per year as of late. And this is balance is even more severe once you consider the impact of housing attrition around 300,000 to 400,000 homes annually.","No surprise then that housing inventories continue to be depleted as evidenced by following rental vacancy rates as you can see in chart 3 in the lower left. And for sale housing stock, which is now less than five months of inventory, a level that is considered to be quite tight for the for-sale market. ","Moving to Slide 8, the picture is even more favorable when you look at the apartment sector. Young adult job growth continue to outpace the rest of the population by about 100 basis points, which is leading to strong rental housing demands and is particularly tight with unemployment rates for college graduates of less than 3%, which we think bodes well for higher end rental housing and new lease up performance. ","Our homeownership rates continue to decline since the recession with reductions pronounced in young adults under 35, but also those ages 35 to 44, which is also a significant part of our rental rates. ","The one area that Bay is watching is new supply as you can see in the lower right after multi-family starts had leveled off over the previous 18 months and the mid 300,000 range; we saw it increase to over 400,000 in Q2. Some of the increase can be explained or maybe explained by the threat of the potential expiration of the 421-a program in New York City as many developers have rushed to get deals permitted and started. But with real demand fundamental still healthy and housing inventories falling, the market may simply be increasing production and be strengthening demand. Any event it\u2019s a trend worth watching and particularly in relation to total housing production and what\u2019s happening in the single-family market.","Turning to Slide 9 you know, perhaps we ought to be looking at the rental housing market through a different lens this cycle than we have past cycles. Here are just the couple of exercise from recent research published by Moody's in the Urban Institute that suggests one that the economic expansion may be far from reaching its end according to Moody\u2019s, particularly when you consider, but that\u2019s for the recession and the moderate level of growth we\u2019ve experienced since then.","In fact, Moody\u2019s and many other believe that this cycle is far from over which we think will benefit cyclical industries like housing. And second the researchers at the Urban Institute posit that rental housing demand is actually in the midst of a generational surge, that still has 15 years to run, a period when they anticipate that five out of every eight new households will be rental households.","So we have been looking back over the last couple of cycles to draw a comparison as to how this cycle may play out for the industry, but maybe we need to start asking whether this cycle really have a president when you consider the confluence of trends that are positively driving rental housing demands.","Indeed when you turn to Slide 10 you can see that effect of rental rate growth has recently reaccelerated despite what is still a moderate economic expansion. If we are in the middle of a prolonged economic and housing cycle this decade, it may prove to be the best we\u2019ve seen in our industry and our markets, even surpassing the 1990s when cumulative rent growth reached almost 60% over a 10 year period or more than twice what we've seen so far this cycle in our markets.","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Sean who can provide some color in terms of how our portfolio is performing given this favorable environment.","Sean Breslin ","Thanks Tim. Turning to our portfolio results on Slide 11. We\u2019re certainly experiencing the acceleration Tim highlighted in the previous slide. Same-unit rent change during the second quarter averaged 6.2%, about 80 basis points greater than the first quarter and 250 basis points greater than Q2 2014. All of our regions are experiencing greater rent change as compared to last year including the mid-Atlantic, which is up about 100 basis points, so roughly 1% as compared to basically flat last year. July is generally consistent with the second quarter with achieved rent change as of earlier this week as 6.4%.","Turning to Slide 12; our results in the first half of the year combined with the current positive momentum in the portfolio supports our increased outlook for the full calendar year. We increased the midpoint of our same-store rental revenue outlook by 75 basis points to 4.75% excluding our redevelopment activity.","We expect better revenue growth from four of our six major regions; the exceptions are the greater New York and New Jersey and mid-Atlantic regions, which are expected to be within our original range. In the mid-Atlantic, better job growth is supporting the higher end of our original range; in New York and New Jersey which is expected to be at the lower end of original expectations, New York City, Westchester County and Northern New Jersey are performing as planned, but both Long Island and Central New Jersey are coming in below original expectations. ","New England supported mainly by Boston, and the West Coast markets, especially Southern California are expected to outperform our original expectations for the year. As we highlighted last quarter momentum in Southern California remains quite positive. In the second quarter, rent change was about 7% in LA and San Diego and almost 8% in Orange County; and San Diego rent change is running about 200 basis points above last year, while in LA and Orange County it\u2019s between 300 basis points and 400 basis points greater than last year.","Turning to Slide 13, we believe the positive momentum in our portfolio supported by our allocation to many supply constrained infill suburban submarkets, this slide Axiometrics shows the year-over-year effective rent growth in urban and suburban submarkets over the past several years, while urban submarkets certainly outperformed in the early part of the current cycle, new apartment supply, which takes longer to deliver in urban submarkets given the nature of the product is now beginning to keep pace with or has surpassed demand in many market. As a result, urban growth rates have slowed, while the suburban submarkets have improved. ","Moving to Slide 14, this suburban urban trend is highlighted in a couple of our markets. On the left is year-over-year effective rent growth in Boston for both suburban and urban assets. While every asset is unique and performance varies depending on where your portfolio is located within a certain submarket, the general trend over the past year has been improved performance in the suburban submarkets, while the urban core has moderated due to increased supply. We are certainly experiencing this trend in our Boston portfolio.","On the right-hand side of the slide is the same data for Seattle, which is experiencing a similar trend given the significant amount of supply being delivered in the urban submarkets relative to suburban submarkets. Overall, Seattle is still a really healthy market given the very strong job growth that is being produced in the region, but on a relative basis suburban assets have started to outperform recently.","Turning to Slide 15, I thought I\u2019d like to highlight a relatively recent shift in our operational strategy; one that we believe has improved our performance over the past year and will continue to do so. The two charts on this slide represent our lease expiration profile throughout the calendar year in 2014 and 2015 for both Boston and Seattle. While many of you are familiar with the seasonal nature of our business, the demand patterns in these two markets are much more seasonal than the rest of our footprint. ","In Boston, the seasonal weakness in the fall and winter is driven primarily by the weather. In Seattle, it somewhat relates to the use of contract workers in the high-tech industry, a percentage of which leave the country during the holiday season. And both regions experience greater demand in the summer from short-term rentals, corporate hires coming out of college et cetera. Over the past year we changed our inventory management strategy to better align our supply of available units with a highly seasonal demand patterns in these two markets. Specifically we\u2019re pushing even greater percentage of our lease expirations into the months for the best demand and highest rents.","In New England we had 20% more expirations in May through July compared to last year, while in Seattle it\u2019s about 40% more. We reduced contracted inventory in the fall and winter months in both regions when demand softens and rents typically decline from their summer peak. By further reducing expirations in the fall and winter seasons when demand is lower, we\u2019ll have less inventory to lease and therefore either higher rents for the unit that are available to rent or fewer transactions and lower rents. We continue to identify opportunities to enhance our operational execution and including these refinements to revenue and inventory management practices and believe they will produce dividends for us in the future.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Tim.","Timothy Naughton","Thanks Sean. I\u2019ll now ask Matt and Kevin to take a few minutes to development activity and funding, which together helping to drive outsized core FFO and NAV growth in 2015, and we believe over the next few years. So, Matt?","Matthew Birenbaum","Alright great. Thanks Tim. Turning to our development activity you can see on Slide 16 that our lease-up communities continue to post impressive results. As a reminder, our general practice is to report rents on an untrended basis on our development communities until we open for business and at least enough apartments to get a good sense of where our current market rent levels are compared to where they were when the deal broke ground. ","This quarter we\u2019ve mark to \u2013 rents to market on 10 of our 29 development communities and the rents of those 10 communities are running $200 per month above the initial underwriting, which in turn is driving 50 basis point increase in the yield on those deals to 7.1%. And importantly, we\u2019re achieving those rents while getting absorption of on average 29 leases per month in the second quarter, which is actually the strongest pace \u2013 lease-up pace we've seen so far this cycle. With cap rates wrestling mid-4% range across our markets, this provide significant NAV accretion as these developments come on line. ","Turning to Slide 17, we broke ground on four new development communities last quarter, representing approximately $400 million versus new investment. Many of our starts this year have been transit oriented infill suburban locations, picking up on the theme Sean had mentioned as we\u2019re seeing better rent growth in those submarkets due to less supply, but our largest start so far this year is actually AVA NoMa community in the North of Massachusetts Avenue district Washington DC. This project should have a pretty compelling cost basis of less than $340,000 per unit, in addition to benefiting from $7 million 10-year tax abatement provided by the District of Columbia and it\u2019s also a good example of our multi-brand platform provides us with a wider variety of product and service offerings to appeal the different customer segments.","This community was originally acquired this land as part of the Archstone acquisition and Archstone had designed it to be the second phase kind of companion to the First & M community next quarter. We were able to reprogram it to provide, but we expect will be a very different living experience with different price points, floor plans, amenities and services, as well as the different style and sensibility that will reflect the contrast between our Avalon and AVA brand. This is similar to the approach we have taken at our downtown Brooklyn, West Chelsea and Somerville sites where we diversified a concentrated investment in a single location by building multi-brand communities. ","On Slide 18 you can see that our local teams have also been busy backfilling the development pipeline and identifying new opportunities for future development. Our development rights pipeline, which represents sites which we control mostly under option contracts has expanded over the past few quarters after bottoming out late in 2014 and now stands at $3.7 billion.","The pie charts on the lower part of the slide also show how the future development pipeline is migrating a bit towards suburban transit infill oriented locations. And that\u2019s just reflection of the fact that we\u2019re finding better risk-adjusted returns in these submarkets at this point in the cycle, which is not surprising given the concentration of new supply in the urban cores and a higher cost basis of high rights construction, which tends to make urban development more profitable in the early part of the cycle.","And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin to talk about our activity on the right hand side of the balance sheet.","Kevin OShea","Thanks Matt. Turning to Slide 19, we highlight the Company's funding position against both our updated capital plan and our development activity underway. As you can see on this slide, company remains exceptionally well funded in both areas. ","Specifically for our updated capital plan, we now contemplate raising $1.95 billion in external capital. Through June 30, we raised about $1.4 billion including $570 million in remaining proceeds under our forward equity contract. In the second half of the year, we expect to raise another $580 million in external capital through a combination of asset sales and the issuance of unsecured debt.","As for our development activity, as of quarter-end our development underway of $3.8 billion was nearly 100% match funded by the combination of $2.6 billion in capital spent to date, plus over $1 billion from cash on hand, projected free cash flow and remaining proceeds under our equity forward. As a result, we\u2019ve eliminated nearly all funding risk, while locking-in significant value creation as these communities are completed and stabilized.","On Slide 20 we show the evolution of a few key credit metrics since 2010, in order to highlight how we have further improved our already strong credit profile through recent refinancing activity. During the second quarter, we raised $620 million in external capital including $520 million in 10 year unsecured debt at about 3.5%. And we repaid $580 million of secured debt with a cash interest rate of 6.2% and a GAAP interest rate of 3.7%. As a result of this activity, our unencumbered NOI percentage is now 76%, up 700 basis points from year-end 2014 and the highest it\u2019s been since before the financial crisis.","In addition the composition of our debt significantly improved such that 56% of our debt is now unsecured, up 900 basis points from year-end. Further, since 2010 our weighted average GAAP interest rate has steadily declined by 130 basis points to 3.9% today, while we\u2019ve reduced the amount of unamortized debt premium from the Archstone transaction down to $60 million today from about $150 million when we closed that transaction.","The next two slide highlight the contribution that development provides both to our earnings growth and to our NAV growth and serve to underscore the merits of our time-tested development capabilities. In Slide 21, we depict the components of our projected growth in 2015 core FFO per share. Of the $0.75 in projected core FFO growth this year $0.37 is projected to come from development and redevelopment activity net of financing costs. Of this $0.37, development is projected to contribute $0.34, while redevelopment is projected to contribute $0.03. Thus development alone should add 500 basis points to our growth rate this year and account for nearly half of our overall earnings growth.","In Slide 22, we highlight developments contribution from an NAV perspective and over a longer period of time, by estimating how much NAV per share we\u2019ve created or we expect to create through development thus far in the cycle. Specifically, development starts and completion since the beginning of 2011 totaled $6.1 billion; of this about $4 billion has been completed or is undergoing initial lease-up and has produced or is producing an initial stabilized yield of 7%. Applying this 7% initial yield to the $6 billion in starts and completions and then capitalizing the resulting NOI to current market cap rate of 4.5% produces an implied value creation above our cost of $3.3 billion. This in turn equates to an estimate of $30 per share in NAV accretion from development starts and completions since early 2011. ","So in sum, through our development capability AvalonBay has provided and continues to provide significant incremental earnings and NAV growth for our investors, while at the same time adding new and exciting apartment communities that enhance the quality of our portfolio and our product offering for our customers.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Tim.","Timothy Naughton","Well thanks Kevin. So 2015 is shaping up to be another strong year. Core FFO growth is expected to come in at more than 11%, driven by strong same-store portfolio performance you heard from Sean, with same-store NOI expected to be north of 5%, a healthy external growth from development as Kevin just touched on, and finally a strong and a flexible balance sheet that as long as the fund and support this growth with attractively priced capital.","And with that Christy, we\u2019d like to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Hi, good morning. A couple of questions, I know you guys are not providing 2016 guidance and just revised the 2015, but if you just kind of look at the trajectory of rent growth that you've kind of seen over the course of the year and you look at where you are sending out renewals, is it a fair assumption to think that absent the real occupancy change that revenue growth will next year at least equal to 2015 kind of from a directional standpoint?","And I guess the other question would just be for I guess Kevin there was I guess on Page 20 of the supplemental, there was a little change it said in expensed overhead and it almost sounded like that might have sort of retarded how much the FFO would've gone up this year. I'm just wondering if you could sort of expound on that and kind of quantify that for us.","Timothy Naughton","Okay. Maybe I\u2019ll take the first question Steve and certainly others can join in and maybe Kevin take the second question regarding overhead. As you saw on one of the slides, we\u2019ve been saying like-term rent change north of 6% for the last few months. It's been positive in terms of its trajectory this year and that\u2019s obviously a leading indicator in terms of portfolio of performance. And as Sean mentioned, we\u2019re expecting to see same-store revenue growth you know 5% or north of 5% in July and just imply from our guidance based upon what we did in the first half of the year we\u2019re expecting 5% range for the back half the year. ","We have said, we think we\u2019re you know, we've got another two, three, four years of \u2013 potentially above trend growth and the question is how much above trend then, it\u2019s a little bit depending upon the ebb and flow of markets. We don't anticipate that Northern California will continue to grow at 10%, but on the other hand we don't anticipate the DC area to continue to languish roughly flat rent growth. So Steve it\u2019s going to be a function ultimately of different markets, but when you look at just from a macro standpoint, particularly I guess the point I made about the end of production of housing and we think sort of a stronger employment picture in terms of the quality of the jobs and we\u2019re starting to seeing decent wage growth, we expect we\u2019ll continue to see good healthy above trend growth and that fundamentals would continue to pay warehousing and specifically rental housing, you know whether that translates into 4%, 5% plus growth, more to come on that.","Kevin OShea","So Steve, this is Kevin. Just to answer your question on overhead and I guess to begin by providing a little bit context for everyone on college, you referenced on Page 20 of our supplemental or our attachment 13 we provided our outlook for the year at the bottom of that, we indicate that our expectation now is for expensed overhead, which comprises corporate G&A, property management and investment management, we expect that that will increase year-over-year from initially 0% to 5% to now 6% to 8%. Just to give you a little more color there, we now project total overhead to increase by about 7% this year versus basically a 3% increase at the beginning of the year. This 4% increase represent about $4 million of which about $1 million was recognized in the first half of the year and $3 million is expected to be recognized in the second half of the year. The majority of the increase is tied to increases in expected compensation based on expected performance to date and expected performance from the year.","In terms of the underlying 3% growth that we initially expected for the year, about half of that was driven by legal settlement in 2014 that\u2019s not present this year and the other half was driven by severance costs recognized in the first half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. For the lease expiration management, how do you think about the benefit from having more leases rolled in the peak leasing season versus the risk of being concentrated too much at one time, and then do you expect to keep tweaking from here as the portfolio currently optimized?","Sean Breslin","Yeah Nick, this is Sean. Just talking about it a little bit, we highlighted the two markets where it matters a lot, which is the New England and Seattle they tend to be the two more seasonal markets in our footprint. So we have applied the same basic strategy to the rest of the portfolio, and you know when you think about it in our portfolio typically what we've experienced is we\u2019re optimizing revenue when occupancy is somewhere in the that mid-95% to 96% range, every market is a little bit different by the way in terms of what sort of average market occupancy is, but that\u2019s been our experience. So as we looked at what was happening with demand patterns across the portfolio we felt like we continue to push more expirations into the second quarter and through July, and to the extent that we could drive enough traffic to the portfolio to continue to push rents at the pace that we have actually experienced.","We think we're in pretty good shape and it allows for us to I guess if you want to call, this growth have an appropriate glide path as we go into the fall because expirations were up in second quarter about 7%, 8% that actually peaks in July, which is up about 14%, but then it comes down in August and September 7%, 8% and 4% or 5% in the fourth quarter. So, we expect to be able to continue to maintain pricing power at a pretty healthy cliff as we go into the fall and winter season, probably more or so than we've experienced in the past, as a result of the expected lower supply of inventory that we\u2019re going to have during those periods. ","And in terms of the balance between occupancy and rate growth, we think we\u2019re in a pretty good position right now as it relates to what we did in the second quarter, what we expect in the third quarter, but it's always a little bit of dance in terms of whether you experienced too much availability and you have pricing pressure or not, we did not experience that in the second quarter. And based on where we sit today, we think we\u2019re in pretty good shape, our 30 day availability peaked around 6%, now it\u2019s down about 50 basis points to 5.5%, physical occupancy is mid-95, it\u2019s going into a period where we\u2019ll have low expiration. So I think we\u2019re positioned pretty well and this strategy we pursued was the right one.","In terms of whether we\u2019re sort of done, you know lease expiration management is something that is sort of a continuous activity, you have lease breaks, you have short-term rentals, lot of things that occur in the portfolio and so you\u2019re always adjusting what allowable leases you\u2019ll offer to a customer, at what price points for those leases to make sure your profile stays optimized. So, might be a little more detail than you like, but I thought maybe it would help in terms of providing context to everyone about our strategy.","Timothy Naughton","Hey Sean, if I can just add to that too. Obviously, the models dynamic is always responding to \u2013 adjusting demand as we see it, but it\u2019s also for an understanding what the market is doing, what the rest of the market is doing in terms of expiration management, and so that alone is going to make us try to maneuver to optimize the opportunities. So for example if the market is smooth \u2013 starting to smooth its expirations relative to where we think demand patterns are, then we\u2019re going to benefit from concentrating more expirations in the peak leasing season, the opposite could be true as well. So it\u2019s going to be a dynamic process in terms of how we manage through it in part because there is always demand dynamic, but also supply in terms of how the rest of the market is using revenue management.","Nick Joseph","Thanks that's very help. And then just in terms of capital needs looking out to 2016, it seems like the spend in terms of development will be similar to this year, so would you do another forward equity offering at this price?","Matthew Birenbaum","Obviously Nick, we don\u2019t comment a lot about future activity in the capital front. And I think we\u2019ve been asked a number of times what our views are in the use of an equity forward, so I guess just to kind of provide everyone that answer again I guess, you know we\u2019ve know about an equity forward as a tool in our tool kit for probably five or six years, we\u2019ve used it only once. It takes sort of a special confluence of events to justify using it, it\u2019s a good tool to have. And it really is a function of what one has elevated funding needs, what ones capital position is at a given point in time and what one expects capital pricing might be as well as availability in the coming period. Given where we are now we feel like we\u2019re in a really great shape from a balance sheet point of view with net debt to EBITDA in the mid-five times range, and we\u2019re potentially nearly 100% match funded against the development that is underway. So we feel good from a capital standpoint even if as it might turn out that spend next year is roughly on par with the share, we\u2019ve haven\u2019t gone through the budget process, so we don't have \u2013 we have some visibility on it, but we don't have \u2013 call it final visibility on what spend levels would be next year, but they\u2019re likely to be meaningful, just given the level of start activity. ","But in terms of the capital choices we might make they often involve naturally what capital pricing is and at this point today, if I were to rank order or track \u2013 based on attractiveness the choices we have, asset sales are much more attractive as the source of equity than is common equity at this point in time. So I would rank them asset sales, then unsecured debt and then followed by common equity issuance. So as we stand here in July it\u2019s far too early to say what our capital spend might be for 2016.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum with UBS. ","Ross Nussbaum","Hey guys good morning. Tim you commented a little bit in your slides about the uptick in starts and permits over the last few months obviously the 421-a situation in New York has put some noise into the numbers, I guess I\u2019m curious if you had to sit back and say on a scale of 1 to 10 how nervous are you that we're moving into a new threshold or new level of supply in the multifamily business. How would you sort of rank your level of concern how that compared maybe where your head was six to 12 months ago?","Timothy Naughton","Yeah, that\u2019s obviously a question on everybody's mind, as I said I think bears watching. But you know maybe to start with the demand side of the picture, I think as the industry \u2013 I think investors and honestly developers and sponsors are looking at the demand side of the picture as being stronger than they may have a year and two years ago, and the cycle maybe play out a little bit longer. So I think there's probably some truth that there is just more confidence, more investor confidence, more developer confidence and there is probably good reason for that, when you look at demand. So I think there is a decent probability that supply will move up from here. I think it needs to move up in order for the market to be anywhere close to being in balance. We\u2019re seeing how it can get distorted in places like Northern California and Seattle, even Seattle where we\u2019re delivering over 3% deploying it, you would continue to see 7% revenue growth. I think what\u2019s interesting though, and probably my biggest concern is who would provide the supply, but if you just look at our kind of our outlook we\u2019re looking in terms of constant dollar volume roughly in 2015 that we started in 2014 and 2013 and 2016 won\u2019t be materially different. It\u2019s actually a smaller unit count.","And as you go around and you talk to some of the more experienced, it\u2019s kind of a similar story, you hear, so the additional supply I think will likely come from new entrants oftentimes who I think sometimes, you know muddy up the market a little bit. So I think that's probably as worth watching as much as anything Ross where the supply coming from, who is \u2013 where the net new kind of add is if you will. So there is somebody who is developing an apartment community, at least the land that they\u2019ve owned for a long time.","For the first time \u2013 commercial and retail developers are doing this for the first time and have other objectives in terms of providing additional supply to the market. So \u2013 and that\u2019s a little bit of a long-winded, I think it's a decent chance that it will occur. I think it\u2019s, the market can absorb it when it probably needs it, just based upon household formation and just the balance of demand between rental and for sale.","Ross Nussbaum","Okay thanks. And just a question on the second quarter turnover ratio. I think you guys did a good job of explaining that, I think you intentionally had higher turnover because you accelerated where the lease expirations are. Were there any markets where the turnover surprised you, maybe as a sign that you might've pushed too hard on the rent gas pedal or was it all kind of intentional?","Sean Breslin ","This is Sean. Good point about being somewhat intentional. Turnover rate was certainly up, but if you look at it as move outs as a percentage of expiring leases, it was actually down about 120 basis points year-over-year. All the markets were down with the exception of Northern California which was up about 120 basis points. I wouldn\u2019t say it was necessarily surprising given the level of rent growth in that region, but Northern California is certainly the one outlier where there is continued pressure on rental rates and driving more turnover in terms of the existing residents, but still being able to replace them with high quality residents and higher incomes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.","Jeff Spector","Good morning. Just a follow-up question on previous comments on where we are in the cycle Tim and your comments today just given the better first half of the year acceleration, expected to continue, you know do you think we're still in mid-cycle? I mean have you, do you feel that maybe obviously things are stronger than you were expecting that we're still in earlier stages or still mid-cycle, but longer? I just want to clarify those comments and how that ties into the increasing you know the decision to increase the development pipeline.","Timothy Naughton","Yeah, Jeff thanks. I would say somewhere in mid-cycle. I don\u2019t know if I could be more specific than that, as we said, we think it\u2019s probably, both this economic expansion and this apartment cycle probably feel more like \u2013 more like the 90s, when you just look at sort of the economic drivers that usually start to portent that maybe the expansion is starting to slow down it\u2019s just not present right now, and you know when they start becoming present, usually it often has another two, three, four years before you see any kind of economic correction. So things that change, but just based upon sort of the underlying fundamental it just seems like this has a few years to play out from our perspective economically and from a real estate cycle standpoint. Now, how does that impact us in terms of this, I would say in certain markets it\u2019s probably, we\u2019re probably more \u2013 a little bit more confident in other markets we\u2019re probably as gun shy as maybe we\u2019ve been over the last six to nine months. For example in Southern California we bought a $100 million piece of lands and six acre site and Hollywood where it\u2019s kind of a unique opportunity to build 700 apartments on a dual branded site, that we felt, you know we felt pretty confident about.","On the other hand if that opportunity had been infill Northern California where rents have already increased 50% this cycle, and to when the auction you might have to assume they\u2019re going to grow another 50%, we probably would've been bold enough to take a piece of land down that side. So I think it\u2019s going to be a little situational and we\u2019re probably going to be a little bit more in press key in markets like Southern California or DC, just fundamentally a different part of its real estate and expansion cycle.","Jeff Spector","Okay. And can you comment, specifically on New York City and especially on the supply front the numbers we\u2019re seeing for 2016. How do you feel about New York City?","Timothy Naughton","Well we are expecting supply deliveries to go up in 2016 as you know. I think the big question are all these permits going to translate into starts, you know last time we saw the threat of the 421-a expire, we did see a bit of spike a couple of years later, so that risk is out there. I think from a land market and a construction cost market you need to be extremely careful in New York City today. I think there's a chance that some of this will translate into starts, which is going to put additional pressure on construction cost. I think there's a chance that the land markets get a little noisy for a while, and that you might be, you might benefit from standing back a little bit and just kind of seeing where the dust settles and take advantage of opportunity that's permitted and after a point at which markets, construction markets maybe have a chance to settle down or replace a little bit. So I think it's going to create \u2013 I think anytime you see uncertainty around regulation that creates more distortions and uncertainty and you know that will create its own set of opportunities, I just don't think it's today right now.","Jeff Spector","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt ","Just given the continued momentum that you guys have seen into August and September, and sort of that 8% range on the offers, should we expect that you guys are going to continue to run at that pace or would you anticipate you\u2019d dough that back a little bit and look to rebuild occupancy as traffic could slow later this year?","Sean Breslin ","Yes Austin, this is Sean. 8% is what we've got out there at this point. You know we haven't necessarily doughed-up what the offers are going to look like for the fourth quarter. I guess I\u2019d just maybe refer back to the common I made earlier is that based on our lease expiration strategy with fewer expirations beginning in August through year-end, our expectation is that we'll be able to hold better pricing power potentially than we have in the past during that season. 8% is a pretty healthy level. And so our expectation is that as availability has come down, pricing power has remained healthy naturally just through lower expiration volume we would expect fewer move outs and better occupancy. But how that plays out in terms of what the rent offers might look like going into the fourth quarter is hard to comment on at this point.","Austin Wurschmidt ","Thanks. And then I guess just touching a little bit on homeownership, look like that declined another 30 basis points in the second quarter, as we get sort of to one standard deviation below the historical mean nationally, 2 plus standard deviations looking at sort of the primary rendering cohorts, how does that stack up today versus in your markets versus the historical average?","Timothy Naughton","I think when you look at homeownership in our markets versus historical average, I think it's obviously lower because our markets have lower homeownership, but I think they're running at around 53. Right now for our market, if you look at the four quarter average, it\u2019s about 51% right now as compared to the previous peak it was 58%, so we\u2019re down about 700 basis points in our market at this point.","Sean Breslin ","The 58% wasn't the norm because nationally the peak had gone up about 500 basis points from 64% to 69%. So I would guess that it was pretty consistent in terms of that trend.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse.","Chris ","Hi guys. This is Chris for Ian. Congrats on the great quarter. It makes sense that you\u2019d be developing more in the suburbs given where we are in the cycle, but just curious about your thoughts on the volume of those starts, especially as you work through the shadow pipeline. It sounds like there's some good value creation there, but just concerned about adding to aggressively to the suburban markets, particularly in the Northeast any concern there?","Matthew Birenbaum ","This is Matt. Actually if you look at what under construction today, it's actually more urban than our portfolio as a whole, so kind of our urban percentage is going to rise here in the next year or two. But the shadow pipeline is more suburban focused that I mean ultimately when you play that out five years from now, our portfolio just based on that probably kind of those proportions don't change a whole lot. It's a big portfolio.","The other thing that we find is we can shape the portfolio much more aggressively through dispositions and potentially through acquisitions really on the development front most of the time what we\u2019re looking at is where we find the most compelling opportunities where we can add value through what we do so well. And it is true a lot of that is in those northeastern suburban submarkets and you will see us tending to sell more out of those locations to keep the portfolio balanced. We did sell one asset that\u2019s here for example in Stamford, we sold an SOS here in Danbury. So those are the types of locations where we're probably more likely to sell.","Chris ","Okay that makes sense. I guess just thinking kind of recovery loss as long as we\u2019re kind of talking about now a few more years that would be giving you the ability to kind of work your through, all the way through the shadow pipeline and if you did that you'd kind of increase the suburban exposure, but it sounds like you just sell out of your \u2013 some of the older assets in those same locations is that kind of what you're saying?","Timothy Naughton","Yeah, I think that's fair. It's also important to note that the character, not all suburbs and not all suburban locations are the same, and a lot of the character of what we\u2019re focused on now is pretty high density infill job centers suburban, so as compared to say a Danbury for example, when you look at what some of the infill suburban starts that we've had recently or we have coming up whether it's great neck, which is North Shore Long Island where we\u2019ve been trying to get in for years and years very close in or we have a big development start coming probably early next year in Amityville in the East Bay or even some of the stuff we\u2019re doing in Seattle, which is kind of in the infill suburbs, Mosaic district at Merrifield that\u2019s this corner, those are some pretty exciting locations as well. And it will be great long-term investments too.","Q \u2013 Chris","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Rob Stevenson ","Good morning guys. It looks like the redevelopment [indiscernible] drop in the supplement, can you guys just talk about how many projects are in there and what the additions to the pipeline and expected returns look like for the rest of the year?","Sean Breslin ","Sure Rob, this is Sean. In terms of the redevelopment activity right now there's, as noted about $123 million underway at seven committees, it\u2019s about 2,800 apartment homes. The mix does continue to shift. Our expectation will be as expressed in the past is we plan to start between $100 million to $150 million per year in redevelopment activity. And as you look at our track record, the track record is actually been quite healthy in terms of returns from that activity where if you think about redevelopment there is two components to it, there is certainly some capital that does not earn a return that sort of end of useful life activity whether you\u2019re replacing roofs and things like that. But there's also the enhancement component, and the enhancement components for us we typically underwrite somewhere in the 10% to 12% range. We've actually been hitting probably more mid-teens in that activity. So I think you\u2019re going to expect it to be somewhere again running in the $100 million to $150 million range and the kind of return profile that I expect, we don't expect to ramp it up dramatically North Sea has softened up materially over the next few quarters.","Rob Stevenson ","What is that $100 million to $150 million mean on a per unit basis?","Sean Breslin ","You know it varies a lot. We have deals that run anywhere from I\u2019d say a low of 15,000 to 20,000 up to about 50,000 a unit. The average in the portfolio now is probably running somewhere in the neighborhood of about 40,000.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then are you guys seeing any meaningful difference between the operating performance over the last six months in the various suburban DC, suburban Maryland district and even into the district?","Sean Breslin ","Yeah. I\u2019d make a few comments on the submarket. So out of the three major markets, here in Metro DC, best to be in the district suburban Virginia and suburban Maryland. Suburban Maryland has been the weakest I\u2019d say over the past quarter. A lot of supply being delivered in Rockville, North Bethesda, a little bit in Gaithersburg, so that's certainly been the softest. ","In suburban Virginia it\u2019s probably holding out relatively well and western Fairfax as an example. The submarket, sort of the softest in Northern Virginia or the RBC corridor in old town right now, and then in DC, it\u2019s a function of positioning first off, but I'd say geographically the softest points are in NoMa as an example. And we've also had some softness around gallery place. And keep in mind for us, we don't have a material relative to the whole portfolio in DC. So our experience is relatively small sample size, but that's what's happening in the district for our portfolio.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates. ","Dan Oppenheim ","Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the Northern California about the rent growth, as given the difficulty in terms of just incomes keeping pace with the rent growth as it is. What are you doing in terms of thinking about obviously a good problem to have in terms of the rent growth at these levels here, but are you doing anything in terms of the tenant screening upfront in terms of looking at residence, some central residence thinking about if you're getting 8%, 9%, 10% rent growth, it can quickly mean that the residence will qualify today won\u2019t be able to handle a year or two from now, are you doing anything to think about that in terms of how to minimize the turn over the next couple of years?","Sean Breslin ","Dan, this is Sean. In terms of that point, I mean obviously you're talking about a topic that is somewhat regulated if you want to think about it that way, in terms of how you screen people and who you can turn away and who you can\u2019t. So for us it's a pretty disciplined process, hasn't really changed. People qualify based on their incomes today you know they're going to move in. We tend to keep an eye on it, just to know what the opportunity is to push rents on those folks in terms of who's in the existing portfolio. But it's hard to sort of size people up to say you can afford this today, but can you afford it year from now I\u2019m not sure. The question really is that if people are moving out can we continue to replace them with enough demand to pay the higher rents and the answer thus far this cycle has been yes. ","Dan Oppenheim","Got it. And then AVA Theater district in Boston, looks as though certainly the rents in that submarket moving up, and I think you're expecting now nice and higher rents, but keeping the stabilization timing as \u2013 probably in terms of pushing the rents more than leasing out faster than you would plan with the construction cycle, and how are you thinking about that overall?","Sean Breslin ","Yeah, this is Sean. I\u2019ll make a couple of comments and Matt or Tim can add on if they want. Theater district first off very \u2013 not surprised, we\u2019re very pleased with the rent profile that we've experienced thus far. But I'd say for two reasons we've pushed rents, but probably are leaving a little bit of gas in the tank if you want to call it that. The two issues are; one, the seasonal nature of Boston which as you get into the fall, it falls off pretty quickly and then as you get into the winter it can be pretty quiet. And then secondly there's a fair amount of supply being delivered in the urban submarkets there in Boston and more to come, so our strategy with that asset has been to rents to market based on where we see today, but making sure that we're continually adjusting them to reflect the supply demand dynamics in that market to achieve targeted velocity each month. And thus far we been able to do that, but given the seasonal patterns that we experienced in the supply we probably aren\u2019t going to push too hard on that and we\u2019ll probably opt slightly more for velocity than rate, as we move through the fall and the winter in Boston.","Dan Oppenheim","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim ","Good morning. I had a question of your disposition guidance because it looks like your net gains will be at the highest level this year other than maybe 2011 or 2013 on a GAAP basis. So I wanted to know if you could provide us some guidance on the gross proceeds you expect for the year, and if these proceeds are already characterized as capital already sourced on Slide 19 of your presentation.","Kevin OShea","John, this is Kevin. I'm not sure if I fully understand sort of the thought process in terms of your comments on gains. But in terms of dispositions for the year they really come in two types; wholly-owned dispositions and fund level dispositions. Wholly-owned obviously being much more meaningful here, so I\u2019d focus my comments on that. In the first half of the year, we sold one asset Stamford Harbor for about $115 million. We had some additional asset sales lined up for the second half of the year. ","Earlier in my comments I talked about what our remaining capital sourcing activity was for the second half of the year, we expect to source about call it roughly $600 million of capital in the back half of the year, and probably about roughly half of that we expect currently will come through the issuance of unsecured debt and the balance through asset sales. So in terms of \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how you triangulate on gain activity, but if there's comments that the question you have on that, let me know.","John Kim ","Sure. It\u2019s just on your outlook for the year, you have net gain on asset sales of $1.69 to $1.83 for the year?","Kevin OShea ","Right.","John Kim","So just backing in for that, just the full year number?","Kevin OShea","Yeah, I mean, this is \u2013 I'm not sure it's necessarily a cyclical high, it\u2019s certainly not cyclical high in terms of the dollar value of assets that we've sold so far this year, but some of the assets we\u2019re selling have a fair bit of gains associated with them. The case of an asset like Stamford Harbor was an asset that we built a long time ago held through quite a bit, and had a lot of built-in gain based on profitable development activity and that's true for a couple of the other assets we expect to sell in the second half of the year that come from more of a suburban market profile that we did long time ago.","John Kim","Okay. And then just sticking to your guidance, your capitalized interest for the year has increased, but your development spend is pretty much unchanged and your interest cost have declined. So can you just elaborate on why the increase in capitalized interest?","Kevin OShea ","Yeah. There's a couple of pieces there. Overall we expect an additional $6 million in capitalized interest expense for the year. A portion of which or about $0.02 is included in the capital markets and transaction activity in the table shown on the earnings release. So \u2013 and that relates to additional investment in land that would be held for development. As Tim mentioned, we bought $100 million parcel in Hollywood California, so that's part of that. The remaining $0.02 to $0.03 that flows from that variance in capitalized interest is included in the interest expense line item and is driven by a mix of variables related to calculation of capitalized interest, but primarily due to slightly higher projected CIP balances throughout the year.","John Kim","Okay great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. ","Haendel St. Juste","Good or I guess good afternoon now. So a couple of quick ones here. I guess Kevin, one is for you looking at the debt maturity schedule, it looks like there's a couple above market unsecured tranches high five coupons set to mature in 2016 and 2017. Pretty well above the 3.5% you recently issued 10- year [ph] paper. So I'm curious as to what's your current thought here how are you weighing the opportunity to perhaps replace these slugs given the rate risk and versus I guess that debt prepay penalties?","Kevin OShea ","Sure Haendel. You know we've got about $250 million [ph] maturing next year, its unsecured debt high five coupon. And it's something we'll take a look at as we roll forward here, nothing planned as yet in regard to that. But it's a relatively modest maturity for us. We have $6.4 billion of debt, probably about $5 billion of it is maturing call it the next 10 years or so. So an average maturity year for us is about $500 million. So that makes 2016 actually a pretty light year with only about $250 million, probably the $280 million if you put some amortization on top of that maturing next year. ","But there may be an opportunity there for us to act on, but nothing that's in the plan as yet. In terms of 2017, that's a larger tower about $950 million. Most of that is represented by secured debt of about $700 million that is in a GSE pool that we assumed in connection with the Archstone transaction. Much of that is in place to help support some tax protection obligations that Archstone had made and that we inherited. That matures as we indicated in 2017 it has two extension options, so we can extend it for one or two years based on our election before that point in time. So we've got some financial flexibility about how we address that. But given that it's tethered to some tax protection obligations, it's less likely a candidate for early action for retirement \u2013 retiring that debt.","I guess probably what's more germane right now is that within our guidance we do anticipate paying off additional debts about $200 million in total that we expected at the beginning of the year and it\u2019s driven by I guess your comment which was what\u2019s the opportunity for refinancing and the prospect of \u2013 facing, potentially rising rate environment. And we do see some opportunities in our debt portfolio if you will to pay off some debt here in the next quarter and do so in an accretive basis.","From an interest rate perspective just to clarify one thing, while the cash coupon on some of the debt is 2016 and 2017 is attractive, it\u2019s in the high fives in the case of 2016 and the cash interest rate in the 2017 debt is also relatively high, the $700 million of debt that we inherited from Archstone, while it has a 6% cash pay interest rate, it has a GAAP interest rate of about 3.4%, but that's just something to point out for modeling purposes. But from our point of view, if you could repay that secured debt in 2017 today, we\u2019d likely to \u2013 consider ways of doing so because it would be certainly attractive to try to refinance that and to a lower coupon, but that does have a prepayment penalty associated with it, that makes an economically unattractive choice today.","Haendel St. Juste","Great. I appreciate the insightful comments. Next question maybe for Tim, maybe for Sean. A question on Seattle; the last couple of years we saw meaningful uptick of supply in downtown Seattle, plus 6% more or less of supply as a percentage of stock. But the next two years, the supply picture really shifts out to Bellevue, we\u2019re looking at about 15%, 16% expansion over the next two years, which is more where I believe your Seattle exposure and as well as some of your peers are. So I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about your Seattle exposure and price point positioning today can and should you be calling, and then is it inconceivable that your SoCal portfolio could surpass your Seattle portfolio this time next year in terms of same-store revenue growth?","Sean Breslin ","Yeah, Haendel this is Sean. I\u2019ll make a couple of comments and Tim or Matt can jump in as it relates to development. Your comment is, certainly accurate that the majority of the supply, high percentage has been focused in Downtown, Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, and if you go there today, I was there just a couple of weeks ago there, sort of cranes everywhere in those various submarket. It\u2019s certainly starting to accelerate in terms of the volume of the supply that is planned in the Eastside and North-end submarkets which is where most of our portfolio is concentrated. And we will continue to watch that carefully. At this point, you're talking about a market that's producing close to 4% job growth. There is some supply coming on line in Bellevue and North-end, that is meaningful as Downtown, but is being observed quickly and we\u2019re still producing 7% revenue growth.","So, at this point what is planned there in terms of the level of supply at current rates of job growth, probably concern us a lot that job growth is not likely to continue at that pace forever obviously, so we\u2019ll have to continue to watch how it evolves on both sides. At this point what's in the pipeline though for Bellevue, Redmond, [indiscernible], Lynwood some of those submarkets isn't all that concerning. And we've got a pretty diversified portfolio in terms of our positioning. We have a lot of older product at reasonable price points, and we been opportunistic on the development side and have some higher-end assets that we are underway with in Newcastle, Redmond et cetera that we think will do quite well in the environment. There should be early deliveries in those submarkets relative to the rest of what's in the planning cycle. So we think we\u2019re pretty well-positioned, but certainly it\u2019s going to have to be something we\u2019re going to watch, as supply starts to ramp up more on the Eastside.","Haendel St. Juste","Any thoughts on SoCal versus Seattle, as we move into well next year?","Sean Breslin","Yeah, I mean it's a very good question. I mean historically Southern Cal hasn't been nearly as volatile as Northern Cal, North Seattle, just given the underlying kind of macroeconomic fundamentals in that market. But there certainly have been times in the past where it's produced numbers up in the call it 7% range. We'll call it roughly 6% now, demand is pretty healthy, still the lowest region of any region in terms of supply over the next two years. So while it's hard to predict where things are going, it's not unimaginable that if you had job growth slow a little bit in Seattle and it continues to move up in Southern Cal with the supply we have that it could get to that level.","Haendel St. Juste","I appreciate the comments. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chow with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chow ","Hey, good afternoon everyone. Just a few follow-up questions here. Just going back to the debt side of things, just curious if the recent treasure rate volatility has really significantly impacted your cost of debt here, do you think you'd still be close to that 3.5% that you recently issued at or is that somewhat higher today?","Kevin OShea","You know the quotes that we\u2019re receiving today for issuing new 10-year unsecured debt for us range between 3.6% and 3.7% today, so a little bit back of the 3.47% yield to maturity that we achieved in May, but not in an awful lot. Call it on average about 20 bps back. ","Vincent Chow","Okay. And just given the funding your need for next year as well as expected issuance here sometime in the second half, would you consider increasing that amount just to sort of prefund given the rising rates and also just again, lock-in some pre-funding?","Kevin OShea ","Our approach is when it comes to funding is not really necessarily to try to speculate on where rates might be tomorrow and mobilized, capitalized \u2013 mobilized capital as a result. It\u2019s really much more driven by our uses and our development activity. And so what we\u2019re much more inclined to do is to match fund capital, so as we make development commitments go out and try to find the long-term capital with that.","So given that we're nearly 100% match-funded today, you know I don't know it would be necessarily, need to be more than that at any point going forward. So probably not highly inclined to try to go out and issue new debt today in advance of the need next year. ","Vincent Chow","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just one last question; just on the comment earlier that you made about bringing \u2013 or on the turnover side bringing in folks with higher incomes and that's helping support some of the rent growth. Just curious if you had the stats of what the renewal income was for sort of the new move-ins versus the existing portfolio?","Sean Breslin ","Yeah, Vince this is Sean. On the lease income data for us if you think about the way we\u2019ve managed the business and I think it's the case for most of our peers as well, is you get a snapshot of someone\u2019s income that they apply, but at the time that they renew their lease, whether it's one year, two years, five years later, you're not re-verifying income. So really the income data that we have for the most part is based on new applicants coming to the community that convert to a move-in, so I can't really disaggregated for you between move-ins versus renewals based on the new applicants. So lease income is up about 6% year-over-year for our portfolio.","Vincent Chow","6%?","Sean Breslin ","About 6% correct.","Vincent Chow","Okay. Thank you.","Sean Breslin ","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Peterson with Sandler O'Neill.","Ryan Peterson","Yeah. Thanks guys. Just touching again on development pipeline, you added $400 million in the quarter, you\u2019ve talked previously kind of tapering it back, is that $400 million you consider that still tapering or is this a reflection of your increased optimism that you talked about the legs of this cycle?","Timothy Naughton","Ryan, I\u2019ll start. This is Tim, and Matt feel free to jump in. If you look \u2013 no, we don\u2019t consider tapering. We've been running you know starts at about $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in the last three years. If you looked at our total pipeline, development rights and development communities underway, we\u2019re about where we were at the end of the 2013 right now in terms of dollar volume, a little less in terms of unit count, but about the same in terms of dollar volume. We\u2019ve talked about in the past, we\u2019ve said, one, we would expect that tapered back a bit just based on opportunities, so it\u2019s really driven more by opportunities than anything else and we have seen some good opportunities over the last few quarters, but may not as expected to seeing call it a year ago. ","Now there are markets where are being more judicious as I mentioned earlier, particular the Bay area and New York City to name a couple, where I guess you know I would be surprised if our pipeline didn\u2019t dial back a little bit just based upon the underlying construction cost, land cost, fundamentals and project the returns given where we are in the cycle.","Ryan Peterson","Hey great, thanks. And then, and if you could just touch again on the New England fundamentals being at your expectations for the year, is that \u2013 what's driving that? Is that all from your new kind of management or is there something that you aren\u2019t expecting in the actual market?","Sean Breslin ","Ryan, its Sean. A couple of things; one, the market is performing better, particularly the suburban submarkets. Job growth has picked up and there is very little meaningful supply really in the suburban submarkets as compared to the urban core in Boston and then certainly we have changed our expiration strategy as I alluded to earlier with New England and Seattle being the two where it\u2019s probably the most pronounced, and so we had set a greater volume of transactions in the second quarter, which will continue through July in that market, which has put material upward overpressure on gross potential growth and a good quarter in New England. So our expectation is that this urban markets will continue to perform well and so good market combined with shipment strategy are really the two components.","Ryan Peterson","Okay, great. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","Yes, good afternoon. Just two quick ones from me. First of all just same-store operating expenses in quite a few regions in 2Q was I\u2019d say, probably higher than we were expecting. Just kind of curious about the high levels of OpEx that quarter and what we should be expecting in the back half of the year?","Sean Breslin ","Sure Tayo, this is Sean. In terms of the second quarter, we provided an original guidance, which was between 3% to 4%. We were a little bit low in the first quarter, a little bit higher in the second quarter. It\u2019s always our plan to be a little bit higher in the second quarter, in fact our original expectation for the second quarter was a little bit higher than what it came, but we received some favorable adjustments on the properties tax side of the house, which helped alleviate some of the year-over-year pressure. I mean as we reiterated in the outlook, we still expect operating expenses to be between 3% and 4%, that hasn\u2019t changed since the beginning of the year, the components may have changed a little bit, so probably a little bit more favorable outlook on tax as an example, but obviously we took a hit in the first quarter in terms of the storms in the New England markets. So it\u2019s starting to move around, but still expect it to be in the 3% to 4% range and it\u2019s about, was about as planned in terms of second quarter.","Tayo Okusanya","That\u2019s helpful. And then second one is along the lines of construction, could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in regards to construction cost trends at this point and specifically if you\u2019re starting to run up again, is there any issues with labor has construction is generally ramping up?","Matthew Birenbaum ","Sure Tayo, this is Matt. It\u2019s a challenge, it\u2019s a real challenge in Northern California, where it seems like hard cost are still growing at you know as much as 1% a month. It\u2019s a challenge in Southern California a little bit less pronounced there, probably a deeper subcontractor base that have more spare capacity when you think about the for sale market and how after that had been last decade there, and how far it\u2019s held back. New York right now, I think we\u2019ve been a little surprised at how\u2019s been moving up in New York and again that could be related to the spike and permits of the 421-a, but you know it is definitely a challenge in those hot markets. Seattle, I don't think is any different that it\u2019s been in the last couple of years, it\u2019s been a little bit, it\u2019s moving up in a more measured way. ","And I do think in some of these markets, San Francisco maybe high-rise in Boston similarly where some of these subcontractors are just fuller and they probably are scrambling to get labor and they\u2019re also making hay while the sun shines and really pushing their margins. And ultimately that probably does correct itself because it will at some point make it difficult for deals to pencil and we\u2019re already starting to see some of that.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","Good afternoon. I was hoping you could talk about the New York Metro area, we\u2019re seeing property revenue growth year-over-year has been relatively sticky around 3%. Is that primarily a product of new supply hitting, is rent fatigue real? If you can just kind of break that out and talk about kind of the individual submarkets and where they fit in?","Sean Breslin ","Sure Drew, this is Sean. Happy to talk about that. It depends on which markets you\u2019re in, so maybe I\u2019ll kind of walk you through some of them. If you\u2019re looking at New York City generally speaking for our portfolio, for the most part the impact that is keeping a lid on revenue growth is really supply, and it\u2019s probably most acute in Brooklyn and in Midtown West. As far as performing assets that we have in the Greater New York City area is the two Avalon Riverview Towers, which are in Long Island City, as well as our Morningside Heights deal up near Columbia those two are the outperformers at this point.","Midtown West has been a little bit on the weaker side, Brooklyn has been a little bit on the weaker side, and the Bowery had done okay. When you move outside of New York City, Northern New Jersey has actually been one of the stronger performing submarkets right along the Gold Coast we\u2019ve been seeing 4% or 5% revenue growth. ","And then as you push out into Central New Jersey it tends to be weaker more in a 2%, 2.5% range. Long Island has done okay, but a little low average. Long Island has been in the 2% to 3% as well. And then Westchester has been holding its own, but you know it\u2019s kind of market that is if you\u2019re doing 3%, 3.5%, maybe 4% at the high end that\u2019s sort of about what you expect in that market and for those, when you think of Central New Jersey, Long Island, Westchester it\u2019s not typically about supply that\u2019s the issue, it\u2019s more about just demand and where the choice \u2013 the choices that are people are making. So it\u2019s typically about the demand side in those markets generally speaking.","Drew Babin","Would you say that rent fatigue is a real phenomenon in Manhattan or are you seeing anybody kind of voluntarily pushing it further out of the city in the interest of saving money?","Sean Breslin","Not really, no. I mean there is plenty of supply, plenty of options and so it really hasn\u2019t been a big issue there in terms of people moving out due to rent increases relative to other markets like [indiscernible] just something like that, so not related to significant rents too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Hey good morning guys. Looking at the expiration shifting, will this give you guys a new structural high for the occupancy or is this more of a rate phenomenon for you guys?","Sean Breslin","Yeah Wes, this is Sean. I wouldn\u2019t think of it as a structural high in terms of occupancy going forward, is that\u2019s what you were talking about in terms of being high. I mean if anything in the second quarter through July probably, it would actually put a little bit of downward pressure on occupancy given the greater expression volume, greater move outs potentially, but also gives us more of a rate opportunity really in terms of more expirations at that point, more transactions when rents were at the highest point during the season. So that was the main reason to shift, it was to take advantage of that opportunity and give us a little more protection going into the fall and the winter in terms of continuing to hold pricing power with just fewer transactions.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors. ","Conor Wagner","Thank you guys. On the Hollywood deal that\u2019s a fully entitled landsite, how does that work from an Avalon AVA mix given that you target different unit sizes and mix with AVA versus Avalon.","Matthew Birenbaum ","Sure Conor, this is Matt. Typically the way it work is the entitlement and it\u2019s true in this case as well are more about the overall FAR parking count, unit count, building mass, and that site actually has five different buildings, four or five different buildings on it, and multiple street frontages. But the entitlements usually don't drill down specifically into this many one-bedrooms, this many two bedrooms, this much average unit size. So we have the flexibility within what's been approved to kind of repack the building if you will and we may take one of the buildings and it\u2019s the whole site been approved for 695 units, we may take one of the \u2013 it\u2019s 300 on one side part, 400 on another, we may shift that around and put 380 up here and 320 down there, as long as we stand there in kind of the overall limit. So there is the flexibility to reprogram and we've done that in a number of places.","Conor Wagner","Great, thank you. And then earlier you guys alluded to a slight increase in debt cost this year versus where you could issued 10-year now versus earlier in the year, have you seen any movement in the debt cost influence cap rates in the dispositions that you are looking at?","Matthew Birenbaum ","It\u2019s Matt again. No, not yet. We have not been as active in the last quarter as we were kind of last year, but we do have some fund assets in the market or getting to come to market now and trying to kind of take advantage of it, we see it as a pretty compelling opportunity. But we just closed one fund asset in the second course, the only closing we had last quarter and it was right around the four cap rate on an older asset in Southern California that was bought by value ad buyer. So we're hearing the talk that maybe buyers are going down the duration, so they\u2019ll \u2013 7-year debt, instead of 10-year debt to make their numbers, but obviously they may be getting more bullish on rent growth or NOI to make up for it. So, so far it really hasn\u2019t had an impact on the transaction.","Kevin OShea ","Conor, this is Kevin O'Shea, just to add to that. I mean, there are \u2013 interest rate cost I guess for 10-year debt are up 20 bps over the last two months, but they have been pretty flattish over the past year or so. In the fourth quarter we did 10-year debt and I think was around 359 [ph], which is pretty much where we are now. So I think, unless we\u2019ve been told there is much pronounced and durable move upward in interest rate it seem like other factors will probably drive asset pricing more.","Conor Wagner","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today\u2019s question and answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Tim Naughton for any closing remarks or comments.","Timothy Naughton","Thanks, Christine. I think it\u2019s been a long call. So I just want to thank everybody for attending today and I hope you\u2019d have a great summer and we\u2019ll see you in the fall. ","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce our host for today's conference call, Mr. Jason Reilley, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley","Well, thank you, Sarah, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release, as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.","As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton","Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our first quarter call. Joining me today are Sean Breslin, EVP of Investments and Asset Management; and Tom Sargeant, our Chief Financial Officer. Sean, Tom and I each have some prepared remarks, and then the 3 of us will be available for questions.","I'll begin by summarizing our results for the quarter, discussing apartment fundamentals and providing some additional details on the Archstone acquisition. Sean will then comment on operating performance disposition activity during the quarter and provide an update regarding our acquisition and disposition plan for 2013. And finally, Tom will share some remarks on development and capital activity, and finish with an overview of revisions to our 2013 outlook.","Beginning with the results for the first quarter, last night, we reported EPS of $0.63 and FFO per share of $0.78. Adjusting for nonroutine items, which primarily include transaction cost and dilution related to our pre-funding efforts associated with the Archstone acquisition, FFO per share increased by 17% from the same period last year. These results were driven by continued strength in our established portfolio, where same-store NOI was up over 5.5% and contributions from new lease-up activity, where achieved rents are above initial expectations and leasing velocity remains healthy.","Turning to the macro environment, the first quarter unfolded more or less as expected. Economic and job growth were solid, although still well under what the U.S. economy has produced in past recoveries. Having said that, the economy appears to be on a path of sustainable growth. U.S. businesses have healthy balance sheets and plenty of liquidity, sitting on nearly $2 trillion of cash. Consumer debt has declined to levels not seen since the early '90s. And finally, the housing market continues to strengthen in its recovery, which should stimulate economic growth going forward. With excess housing inventory having been worked off in most major markets and the rate of household expansion growing to about 1.4 million households this year, the housing sector will need to ramp up production from its current rate of just under 1 million per year to prevent a housing shortage from materializing.","This, in turn, will contribute to economic and job growth, which will help sustain a broader economic recovery.","With this macro environment as a backdrop, we remain optimistic about apartment fundamentals. Apartment demand will benefit from a combination of stronger household growth and favorable demographics.","The young adult cohort is growing, and these individuals are finding employment at an increasing rate. In fact, job growth for this cohort is the strongest since the 1970s and has accounted for about 45% of net new jobs since 2010. And as mentioned last quarter, this young adult cohort is less likely to purchase than we've seen in past recoveries. Driven by changing lifestyle preferences, the desire for greater flexibility and tougher mortgage standards, the homeownership rate for this cohort has declined by twice that of the overall U.S. over the last few years. As a result, despite tepid economic growth, apartment absorption has been stronger than any period since 2000, and the continued growth in the echo boom demographics should be a strong driver for apartment demand over the next decade.","As apartment demand has strengthened, deliveries and permitting activity have turned up and supply is approaching its 20-year average. As we've discussed in the past, we'll feel the most pressure in the D.C. area and is unlikely the demand will be sufficient to absorb the heightened level of new supply we'll see in this region for the next 6 to 8 quarters. Supply will be elevated in Seattle and San Jose as well. But those markets are better positioned to absorb new deliveries given the strength of their local economies.","Importantly, in all of these markets, we do see supply leveling off in 2014 before returning to more normalized levels in 2015.","Turning to Archstone. As most of you know, we closed the transaction along with our partner, Equity Residential, in late February. In connection with this transaction and prior to closing, we pre-funded about $2.7 billion of capital through a combination of new equity, unsecured debt and the sale of assets that were designated to AvalonBay.","In addition, at closing, we issued another 1.9 billion of shares to Lehman and assumed net secured debt of $2 billion after paying off roughly $1.5 billion at closing. And finally, on March and shortly after closing, we completed the sale of approximately $200 million of Archstone assets that were under contract at the time of closing. We have now completed all of the financing connection with this transaction, including the sale of all the planned Archstone dispositions.","Over the last 2 months, we have made substantial progress on the integration effort. During this period, we've hired and on-boarded over 600 talented new associates at the site and overhead level. We've converted all the new properties to AVB systems and platforms, including the transfer of all on-site financial administration and resident communication to our customer care center, Virginia Beach. We've taken over development and construction management of 5 communities under construction and added 6 new Development Rights to our shadow pipeline. In addition, we completed diligence and chose not to pursue the development of 6 other Development Rights that were designated to AVB. With respect to our parking lot joint venture with EQR, we finalized business plans to operate and ultimately liquidate all remaining assets.","Lastly, we managed the beginning stages of the wind-down process of the Archstone entity in Denver, a process that will continue for several more months. During this time, we'll also be focusing our energies on completing the integration process with our new associates through additional training and with the communities through our rebranding efforts.","While there are certainly work to be done, so far, we're exceptionally pleased with our progress on the integration front. We're also very pleased with the performance of the assets, which Sean will touch on in his remarks.","Lastly, I do want to briefly comment on transaction costs that were recognized in Q1 related to the Archstone acquisition. Acquisition costs, charged to earnings were substantially less than our original outlook due to a combination of accounting changes and real cash savings. These revisions accounted for a significant portion of the changes to our updated outlook, and Tom will provide more detail on these and other changes in his comments in a few minutes.","But first, let me turn the call over to Sean, who will comment on portfolio performance and transaction activity. Sean?","Sean J. Breslin","Thanks, Tim. As Tim mentioned, I will comment on portfolio performance during the quarter, current trends and provide a brief update on our transaction activity.","Starting with our same-store results for the quarter, year-over-year total rental revenue increased 4.9%, consisting of a 4.7% increase in rate and a 20 basis point increase in occupancy. Same-store expenses increased 3.3% and were primarily driven by higher property taxes, utilities and insurance costs. We continue to feel pressure on property taxes from local municipalities, especially in suburban New York, Seattle and the D.C. Metro area, where increases in both rate and assessed value are projected to drive double-digit property tax growth in 2013.","In terms of regional performance, Seattle and Northern California continue to produce strong results, generating year-over-year total rental revenue increases of 8.9% and 8.7%, respectively. These regions also produced sequential revenue growth of about 1%.  Job growth remains robust in Seattle and continues to fuel apartment demand. Boeing has a healthy backlog of orders for new aircraft, as airlines work to replace aging fleets across the globe. In the tech space, Google recently announced that it was doubling the size of its campus in Kirkland, which should add about 1,000 jobs to the area.","The Seattle apartment market is also benefiting from an extremely low inventory of single-family homes for sale. Current inventory is at a 15-year low and reflects about 1 month supply, which is putting pressure on single-family pricing. Median price of a single-family home has risen close to 20% over the past 12 months.","Northern California, like Seattle, has experienced job growth well in excess of the national average over the past 6 months. Facebook, Salesforce, LinkedIn and Samsung have all committed adding jobs or in increasing office space over the last several months. Also like Seattle, Northern California single-family market is very tight. But the median price for single-family homes and condominiums up 20% to 25% in the Bay area markets over the last 12 months.","Moving down the California coast, Southern California produced year-over-year rental revenue growth of 4.5%. Trailing 12 months employment growth is now north of 2% in L.A., Orange County and San Diego. Continued hiring by the entertainment industry, which has added jobs at a tremendous pace over the past 12 months, is leading the growth in Los Angeles.","In the greater Orange County region, job gains are pretty broad based and include hiring in the entertainment sector led by Disney; financial services, including Bank of America; health care, including UC Irvine Health and Kaiser Permanente; and education.","San Diego job growth picked up significantly over the past year and was led by the return of several Navy ships, but has also been supported by above-average growth in the business services, biotech and construction sectors. Steady job growth, multi-family supply that is less than 1% of existing stock and double-digit growth in home prices should all support healthy apartment fundamentals in Southern California over the next several years.","Shifting to the East Coast. The Mid-Atlantic produced year-over-year total rental revenue growth of 1.5% during the quarter. Job growth in the D.C. Metro area is essentially flat, and sequestration has resulted in some furloughs across the region. In some submarkets, our current residents on the government's payroll are less willing to sign longer-term leases given the uncertainty regarding additional furloughs.","We expect new supply to peak in the second half of 2013 and lessen a bit in 2014 before returning closer to the longer-term norm in 2015. Development economics are increasingly challenged within the region, and the oversupplied market is well known by both construction lenders and equity investors, so new starts should be significantly more constrained over the next year.","The metro New York\/New Jersey region is producing our strongest results on the East Coast with year-over-year rental revenue growth of nearly 5% during the quarter. New York City tech led recovery continues and is supported by job growth in the education, health services and retail sectors. And while new supply continues to be delivered in certain submarkets, it has not had a significant impact on rent growth or occupancy rates.","Finally, the New England region produced year-over-year total rental revenue growth of 3.2%, reflecting 4% in Boston and 1.7% in Connecticut. Job growth in Boston continues to be steady and is relatively consistent with the U.S. average of roughly 1% over the past 6 months. On the supply side, most new construction is concentrated in the urban submarkets of Boston and will be delivered in late 2013 and 2014.  Developers are beginning to consider more suburban sites in Boston. But the pipeline of suburban development is still relatively thin as a percentage of existing stock as compared to the more -- as compared to the urban submarkets.","The greater Fairfield market continues to be relatively weak with essentially no job growth in the past 6 months and supply that has ticked up over the past year. Supply is particularly plentiful on the waterfront in Stamford and will likely be heavy for the next 12 to 24 months.","Moving to recent performance trends. Availability for the quarter averaged 5.2% and turnover was 41%, down about 300 basis points from Q1 2012. The reduced turnover rate resulted from fewer move outs due to rent increases, particularly in Northern California. Move outs due to home purchase were 14% in Q1, an increase of about 70 basis points compared to Q1 2012.","Same-store portfolio occupancy is currently running in the low to mid-96% range. And consistent with seasonal patterns, rental rates are ramping up across most of the portfolio. Committed renewals for April are around 5%. Renewal offers for May and June are in the 6% range, and July is likely to go out around 7%. In addition, average market rent for the same-store portfolio has increased roughly 5% to 6% over the past 60 days as availability has trended below 5%.","In terms of the recently acquired Archstone assets, the portfolio is currently outperforming our revenue expectations by 2% to 3%, supported primarily by better-than-expected average rental rates, but also a modestly higher occupancy rate. It is a little too early to comment on operating expenses, which often have a lot of noise in the first quarter following an acquisition, but we don't have any material concerns at this point in time.","I'll turn now to our transaction activity during the quarter. In terms of AvalonBay dispositions, we sold Avalon to Decoverly located in Gaithersburg, Maryland for about $135 million, which represented a low 5% cap rate and economic gain of $63 million in an un-leveraged IRR of 14.5% over the approximately 15-year holding period. The initial phase of this community was purchased in 1995 and redeveloped by us a couple of years ago, and we developed the second phase in 2007. We also sold 2 communities located in Arlington, Virginia, that required as part of the Archstone acquisition. These communities traded a low 5% cap rate as well.","We sold 2 Fund communities during the quarter. Avalon Yerba Buena of Fund I property located in the south of market, submarket of San Francisco, sold for $103 million and represented a residential cap rate in the high 3s. Avalon Rothbury, our Fund II asset, located in Gaithersburg, Maryland, sold for $40 million and a cap rate in the mid-5% range.","In addition to the Q1 activity, we have another couple hundred million of dispositions either in marketing or under contract, including 2 Fund I properties. We have not identified attractive acquisition opportunities, so we don't currently have any communities in our acquisition pipeline. The transaction market remains healthy with cap rates generally ranging from 4% to 5% on the West Coast and 4.5% to 5.5% on the East Coast with the exception of New York City, where assets tend to trade in the low 4% range depending on how you value any tax abatement.","Demand for large core assets in coastal markets is being driven by institutional investors, while smaller core assets and value-add opportunities are the sweet spot for private leveraged buyers. With the 10-year U.S. Treasury trading back down to roughly 1.7% on a yield basis, private buyers can source 10-year secured debt in a 3.5% to 3.75% range from the GSEs and be inside them 20 to 30 basis points via balance sheet lender. As a result, cap rates in the 4% to 5% range offer positive leverage and attractive returns on equity relative to other investments.","If you exclude the Archstone transaction, the number of one-off trades in our markets is down approximately 15% in Q1 2013 as compared to Q1 2012, while volume in other markets is up close to 20%. Given the limited supply of products for sale and the attractive cap rates we are realizing in the transaction market, dispositions remain an attractive source of capital relative to other alternatives. As a result, we have elected to revise our acquisition and disposition plan for the year.","We're now expecting acquisition activity in the range of $150 million, a reduction of $150 million from our initial outlook, and dispositions of roughly $900 million, including the Archstone communities that were already sold, an increase of $200 million from our initial outlook.","Now I'll turn the call back to Tom for some other remarks.","Thomas J. Sargeant","Thanks, Sean. As Tim noted in his comments, I'll share a few remarks regarding our development and capital activity. I'll add some color on our revised outlook with a focus on how lower Archstone transaction cost impacts our outlook.","Turning to development, we completed 3 AvalonBay developments this quarter for a total capital cost of about $180 million. These communities were delivered ahead of schedule and have outperformed our original expectations. Each completion is projected to produce an initial stabilized yield of 7.5% or better.","For those communities under construction and in lease-up for the entire quarter, performance is equally impressive with achieved rents that are about $80 ahead of pro forma and projected initial yields that are about 60 basis points better than pro forma.","We also started 2 new AvalonBay developments this quarter, totaling $260 million, and acquired 5 Archstone developments underway for another $280 million in projected costs. Altogether, we had 30 communities under construction during the first quarter, representing $2.4 billion in total capital investment with a projected stabilized yield of 6.7%.","We're also active with the development pipeline, adding 4 AvalonBay Development Rights with over $300 million in projected capital investment and 6 Archstone Development Rights for another $700 million in capital, and our shadow pipeline now stands at about $3.6 billion. We expect construction underway to continue to grow over the next several quarters before peaking in the first half of 2014 in the $3 billion to $3.5 billion range.","Turning to capital activity. Now that the Archstone transaction is closed and funded, we now have greater clarity and visibility regarding our funding needs for the year. Our initial outlook called for between $700 million and $900 million of new capital during 2013. Our revised plan now calls for expanded sales and reduced acquisitions, as Sean mentioned, and reduced Archstone-related transaction costs and development activity.","Accordingly, there is less external capital now required. Our new range for external capital is between $200 million and $300 million, and this can be easily funded from our undrawn credit facility, but we will also consider opportunistic capital markets activity depending on pricing and overall market conditions.","Our projections for debt to EBITDA underscores the flexibility we have in meeting this funding need. If all of the $200 million to $300 million of external capital required is funded by our line, our year-end debt to annualized EBITDA would be about 6x, well within our target range. So over time, we'll look to source attractively priced capital to fund our permanent capital need, while focusing on important liquidity and credit metrics consistent with our outlook for the capital markets.","Turning to the outlook. We did revise our projections for FFO and operating FFO for 2013. For operating FFO, we now project between $6.14 and $6.44, and FFO in the range of $4.98 to $5.28 per share. At the mid-point, this reflects a revision of $0.14 and $0.84 per share, respectively.","The $0.14 of improved outlook for operating FFO was driven by better-than-expected operations and lower overhead. These items contribute about $0.10 per share of the $0.14. The other $0.04 is increased amortization of the mark-to-market on the debt.","Note that the updated operating projections pertain solely to Archstone's revenue and overhead. The AvalonBay portfolio performed largely as we expected, so no adjustment to core AvalonBay revenue or expenses was made in the 2013 outlook revision that we provided last evening. We will update operating expectations for both the AvalonBay portfolio and the Archstone portfolio in connection with our second quarter earnings release.","So while our operating outlook improved, we are updating guidance primarily due to the $0.84 positive change in FFO projected for the year. This change is due to how we are required to account for certain Archstone acquisition costs, more costs being capitalized than expensed, but also from significant actual cost savings. The overall economic impact to this outlook change is that the actual cost -- the actual cash transaction costs are now expected to be $42 million lower than we anticipated at the time our initial outlook was given, much of this due to reduced transfer taxes.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Tim for some closing remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton","Thanks, Tom. So in summary, the first quarter was certainly an exciting and rewarding one for the company with the closing of the Archstone acquisition, a solid portfolio performance and the continued success of the development portfolio.","Our revised outlook for operating FFO growth for 2013 is more than twice the sector average. In addition, our $5.7 billion development pipeline provides compelling source of earnings and NAV accretion over the next few years. And as Tom shared, we currently have significant liquidity, a strong balance sheet and the financial flexibility to fund this growth in a cost-effective manner for the balance of 2013 and beyond.","Lastly, before opening up the call, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the outstanding contributions and leadership over the last 20 years -- 28 years of our Chairman, Bryce Blair, who, as many of you know, has chosen not to stand for reelection to the board later this month.","During his career at AvalonBay, Bryce has literally touched and influenced every part of the organization, helping lead our company from its roots as a private development firm to one of the largest and most respected public real estate companies in the country. As colleagues, we'll certainly miss his leadership and guiding hand, but as his friends, we wish him the best as he moves onto the next chapter of his life.","And with that, operator, we're ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rob Stevenson of Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Can you guys just talk about with the Archstone assets you guys are up to a $2.2 billion development pipeline, what's the appetite from here to start new projects over the remainder of this year and the first part of next year until a lot of these bigger dollar volume ones burn off?","Timothy J. Naughton","Rob, this is Tim. I think, as Tom mentioned, we do see the pipeline continuing to grow to $3 billion to $3.5 billion early next year, when we -- at which point we expect that roughly would peak just based upon the existing -- the projected timing of the deals in terms of when they'd be ready to start. Obviously, we tried to position the balance sheet and our liquidity to give us plenty of flexibility in terms of how we fund that. But in terms of the economics of the business, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it continues to be very compelling, with projected yields on the stuff that's under construction of 6.7%, but oftentimes, the deals once they start leasing up, particularly in this kind of market environment, we've been seeing improvement. As Tom mentioned in his remarks, the 3 deals that we just recently were completed -- were completed at more like a kind 7.5% stabilized yield. So tremendous profit potential embedded in our pipeline. So we'll continue to move forward with development, whether that's funding that through new capital or through recycling capital through disposition program. But we expect it to peak around $3 billion to $3.5 billion early next year, which would represent around 13%, 14%, 15% of total enterprise value, which is the number we've talked about in the past that we'll be comfortable seeing it get up to.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","I mean, obviously, you guys control land development rights for some period of time before you start construction in a lot of cases, but what do you -- and so the land costs are somewhat less variable for you guys than they are for competitors. But what are you seeing right now in terms of construction costs. I mean, in terms of both stick and steel build and concrete, et cetera, I mean how much inflation are you seeing on that side and what is that doing to expected returns on stuff that you'll start later this year or early next?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, Rob, I mean, obviously something we've been talking about the last few quarters. We have been seeing movement back up in construction costs, back towards the prior peak from 2007. So we are still talking about costs that were 6 years ago in terms of where they peaked previously. But it's very much market dependent. Right now, we're seeing a lot more pressure on the West Coast, particularly California, where the subcontractor market continues to be a little thinner, where we have seen pressures there on a year-over-year basis, double digit, 10%, 11%, 12%. On the East Coast, in D.C., interestingly where there's been a lot of production or even in places like Seattle, it's been more modest, it's been more in the 5% to 7%, 8% range in terms of construction pricing growth. But -- so there hasn't been a material impact in terms of yields, as you've mentioned, land is locked in. So construction generally represents about 65% of the total capital,  so to the extent that's grown at 5% to 7% or 8%. But it's only representing 2\/3 in lands fixed. As long as NOI is growing around 5%, your yields really haven't moved that much. I think you'll see that as you look back over the last several quarters in terms of what our average projected yield. It just hasn't moved that much off that kind of high 6% range.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Are you guys expecting to start any material amount of redevelopment of the Archstone assets?","Sean J. Breslin","Rob, this is Sean Breslin. As it relates to redevelopment, we do believe that a majority of the Archstone assets have redevelopment opportunities. Our teams are going through all the assets and re-sequencing our redevelopment pipeline to integrate the new Archstone assets in with the AvalonBay assets. We probably have more clarity on that over the next couple of quarters in terms of what the dollar volume out of the Archstone assets specifically would look like, but my expectation is, particularly later this year and as we get into '14 that we'll start to ramp up.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just lastly, on the expiration lockup, I mean, has there been any consideration on accelerating the disposition program in order to raise capital to try to buy back shares from Lehman?","Timothy J. Naughton","No, not really, Rob. I mean, it really speaks more to how we've been funding the base business, the ongoing business in terms of funding development. As you know, as our share price has drifted into the low 130s, we think dispositions are more compelling source of capital right now than equity. So that's really what's been driving it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Two questions. The first, you guys talked about integrating the 2 platforms and both on the operations and development front. Just sort of curious how much -- how different the 2 platforms as far as the people and systems are between the way Archstone did things and the way AvalonBay does things, both on the operations and then also with respect to development.","Sean J. Breslin","Alex, this is Sean. I'll pitch on the operation side and then maybe Tim could comment on development. On the operation side, first and foremost, critically important is the cultures of the 2 organizations are very similar. So in terms of the integration of people and operating within the framework of the organization, that's gone extremely well. And as it relates to systems, there are a lot of systems that are similar in terms of safe rents, LRO, MRI, et cetera. There are different variations in terms of how they use those systems that we have now modified for the majority of our main operating systems. We are still investing in technology to upgrade some of our systems in terms of our resident portal and things like that to enhance the capabilities there. But in terms of systems integration itself, to operate the sort of core business, significant overlap there in terms of use of the same systems, and that allowed us to basically transfer everything onto our technology platform within the first 30 days that we owned the assets. So as it relates to the development. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, and so probably the biggest difference on the development side is they use construction managers, third-party construction managers to build out their deals. We typically self-perform. So that's been -- we inherited some of those contracts. So we stepped into some of those. So that's a little bit -- a little different. But in terms of the people, I mean, we hired a lot of the folks, several of the folks on the development and the construction side. In terms of just discipline in terms of how they budget and report, quite similar to how we look at running and managing the business. So not a lot of disparity there.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is, and maybe this goes to the $0.10 of out-performance or maybe this is in addition to. In the supplemental, where you guys break out the NOI and rental revenue, et cetera, it looks like the Avalon portfolio runs about 40 basis points more efficient from an NOI margin perspective despite the fact that Avalon and Archstone on the same-store basis have similar rental revenue rates. So should we expect that there's -- this 40 basis point gap will close and that's opportunity for more upside? Or maybe that's the $0.10 number that, Tom, you spoke about earlier?","Sean J. Breslin","Alex, why don't I take the first part of that. In terms of the operational efficiencies, one, I'd be a little bit careful about extrapolating based on what's essentially 1 month of data. That being said, we don't expect the operating margins to be materially different. We do expect some improvement based on how we plan to operate the properties, but it probably is a little bit too early for me to go into that level of detail at this point in time.","Thomas J. Sargeant","Alex, on the $0.10, that really is more of a true-up of how we saw the portfolio performing in March and then into April as we've got some of our first of month billing data. So the budgets that they -- that Archstone had prepared, we adjusted them for differences in accounting and a couple of other areas, but largely adopted those budgets. And we -- and those budgets were done last fall. So there was -- some of that $0.10 per share was really just true-ing up for better than expected performance out of those budgets.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Toti of Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just a quick question, Tim. Are you guys seeing any kind of pricing power differentials between the difference sub brands now that you've been operating for some time?","Timothy J. Naughton","David, nothing that we would be sort of comfortable. I think, kind of -- sort of on Sean's last comment really extrapolating from. I mean, clearly, there's -- we -- there's a couple AVA deals in particular that we've opened that are quite distinct and differentiated within their submarkets. And they appear to be a little bit more insulated from some of the pricing pressure that we've seen in those submarkets. I think AVA H Street here in D.C. is a great example of that, where we've been able to keep rents and push rents despite a fair bit of supply coming on in the district. And it really is a unique and differentiated asset there. It's one that we intend to take. If you're going to be at our Investor Day in late June, it's one that we intend to take people around and hopefully get a flavor for. But it's more anecdotal at this point. But clearly, one of the swaps [ph] behind the branding is to try to create more of a differentiated offering to the market that's more targeted that you would hope would insulate you a little bit more from pricing pressures as markets soften.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Great. And then I just want to expand on some of the questions Rob was asking earlier about development. What kind of rent growth are you underwriting in your developments that you're starting to be able to see the first 1 or 2 years, and maybe we can look at some of the recent starts like Huntington or Stuart Street maybe as examples?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, in terms of what's listed on Attachment 8, there's effectively no rent growth embedded in that, David. So the only rent growth would come through when we're actually start leasing and then, that's effectively when the asset is -- the asset's rents, if you will, are mark to market. But up until that time, we typically don't adjust rents or reflect any movement in market rents. There is occasionally an exception to that where there's been such an adjustment or movement in the market up or down that we might make an exception. But in this particular schedule, there's no exception, and rents are reflected at what they are, what they were set at pro forma or at the start of construction until the time at which we start leasing, and we usually don't adjust until we clear maybe about 20% of the units through the lease-up process.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And I think you might have touched those, but just -- I'm sorry, I jumped in a bit late. If you were seeing any kind of construction cost increases, I assume you pushed those through to the rent line before leasing commences. So that's not impactful necessarily to margins either?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, in terms of Attachment 8, usually we're locking down construction cost at the time we start. So we don't -- we wouldn't necessarily anticipate the cost on Attachment 8 to move as it relates to movement in construction price in the market given that these are typically fixed at the time we start. So it could have an impact on the shadow pipeline as we start deals over the next 6 to 7 months, and I did mention as a response to Rob's question, we are seeing uneven pressure across our markets from mid-single digit to low double digit in the case of California on a year-over-year basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You gave stats on renewals 30 and 60 days out, but can you talk about new and renewal lease rates trended through the first quarter by month?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure, Nick, this is Sean. I'll give you sort of the overview. In the first quarter, overall rent change averaged about 3.5% during what is, as you know, probably the seasonally slow first quarter. That's about 100 basis points lower than what we experienced in Q1 2012. And as you probably know, Q1 is where we're really trying to build occupancy for the Q2 and Q3 rent push. So we're pretty well positioned going into the stronger leasing season right now with occupancy greater than 96% and availability below 5%. So I think we're in pretty good shape there overall. In terms of the monthly trends, certainly, if you sequenced it by month, it moved up through the quarter, starting in the low 3s and ending basically in the high 3s to get to the 3.5%.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of development, how did expected stabilize yields for the acquired Archstone development assets compared with your existing pipeline?","Timothy J. Naughton","Nick, this is Tim. Somewhat similar a little lower, and I think we've spoken to this in the past and that the way that we valued those development deals, it's a little bit different. Obviously, you have  less risk stepping into a deal that was already permitted and then titled and where the costs were already negotiated. So you really just had market risk at that point. So the pricing in terms of how we price those deals reflected that it was less risk, but it's roughly in the mid-6s to give you a sense that basket of communities that came onto schedule 8 Archstone.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Spector, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Jana for Jeff. You mentioned how the integration was going well and I was just curious on the branding side. Are you looking to make some of the Archstone communities Eaves or planning for them to be more AvalonBay communities?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Jana, this is Sean. We do expect to re-brand all of the communities to -- at least a majority of them in our core markets, at least, non-core markets we may not, but to 1 of our 3 brands. And there will be a mix of all 3 brands, AVA, Avalon and Eaves that will come out of the Archstone portfolio. So we're going through that process right now on our expectations that we would be rebranding all of the communities within 12 months.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And maybe a little bit longer term, how are you thinking of the portfolio composition between the 3 brands?","Sean J. Breslin","Overall, what we've talked about in the past is -- and these are rough numbers just depending on what the opportunities are as we roll forward in development and redevelopment acquisitions, et cetera, but generally somewhere in the 75% range, 70%, 75% range in terms of Avalon, 20% range in terms of Eaves and the balance to AVA, which is the smaller, more boutique kind of specialized brand.","Operator","Your next question comes from of Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors.","Unknown Analyst","You touched on this a little bit earlier, but can you elaborate more on the thought process behind increasing your net disposition plans and therefore reducing your capital needs? Was it driven primarily by a desire to reduce equity needs or the perception of those?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Dave, this is Tom. When we prepared our plan earlier in the year, we identified $700 million to $900 million of capital needs, and we generally wait until the market conditions are set, and when we need that capital to decide whether it's debt, equity or asset sales. As the year progressed and as we look at the transaction markets, it just became -- the markets became increasingly tighter. And if you look at the expected performance on our dispositions and the -- really struggling to get acquisitions, we felt like expanding dispositions in a tight market and the fact that we weren't able to really identify any strong acquisition candidates made a lot of sense. Certainly, if you look at that source of capital dispositions versus selling equity or selling debt, we felt like that disposition activity was a better source of capital for us, and we've actually started putting in place the steps that we need to take to expand that disposition activity. So it really is driven off of a tight transaction market and the fact that our needs are less because of less transaction costs on the Archstone side as we settled that portfolio. Tim, I don't know if you wanted to add anything?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, and Dave, maybe just a follow-up from last quarter, I think, we talked about our capital needs for this year were really backloaded, and typically we look at our disposition plan a couple of times a year, usually going into the end of the year and then mid-year. So it was just -- it's also just part of a normal process of updating our transaction plans, as market conditions shift, and about twice a year, it feels about right to us to do that. So it's just sort of lined up with our normal business process anyway. And as Tom mentioned, obviously, dispositions look to be more compelling relative to some of the other sources of capital as we thought about capital -- bring on the capital that we needed for the back half of the year.","Unknown Analyst","And another question is on Archstone, can you talk a little bit more about the performance of the portfolio, perhaps first quarter revenue growth or -- and also your outlook for revenue growth for the full year, do you expect it to be within the same range as your same-store portfolio or different?","Sean J. Breslin","Dave, this is Sean. I indicated that we're -- the initial performance is above our expectations on the revenue side, about 2% to 3%. At this point, given where we are in the process, we're not prepared to talk about some of the exact things that you requested. I can tell you from a renewal point of view, as we look out over the next 2 to 3 months, renewal increases are relatively consistent with what we're seeing in our same-store portfolio on average. But there are some market-by-market differences. So for example, here in D.C., renewals are going out a little bit higher rate on the Archstone assets than the AvalonBay assets. And that's just a function of where those assets are located, the supply that's coming online, current availability, et cetera, et cetera. So if I have more information for you in the future on that, but that's sort of as far as we're willing to go right now in terms of general commentary about the performance of the properties.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Rosivach of Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Caitlin Burrows. We just have a quick question. We are wondering if the higher development yields that you're projecting had any impact on the increase in your full year guidance?","Timothy J. Naughton","Caitlin, no, not really. I think, as Tom mentioned, the guidance was really driven by just greater visibility into the closing cost of the Archstone transaction, how those closing costs would be booked and then just again, a greater visibility related to the overhead that was required to bring on these additional assets as well as just the fact that now -- we now have owned the assets a couple of months and just have -- just more knowledge of how they're operating. So it was really driven by the Archstone transaction and, as Tom mentioned, the base business, whether it's development or same -- or the AvalonBay same-store portfolio, is performing as expected.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Thanks for the rundown on how each of your markets are performing. Just curious, based on that analysis, markets that you think are performing better than you expected versus markets where you're performing a little bit worse than expected and why?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure, this is Sean Breslin. In terms of how they're performing relative to expectations, obviously, we just sort of set expectations not too long ago. So I'd say, generally speaking, the same-store portfolio is operating, I think as Tom alluded to, about where we expected it in terms of performance. The Archstone assets, as I mentioned, are performing a little bit ahead of expectations. But I think that really is more a reflection of sort of true-ing up, where those assets are performing relative to the budgets that were established before the end of 2012. So on a same-store basket basis, things are pretty much about where we expect it. And I think that's about it in terms of any variance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just have one quick one. Do you guys feel like -- I know you brought in a lot of folks from Archstone, but what about at the executive suite level, do you guys feel like you are good to go? Or do you need any more talent at your level with the bigger portfolio?","Timothy J. Naughton","Rich, this is Tim. Maybe you're a better judge of that than we are. But no, we think we're at the executive level -- C suite level, we're set. Just to be clear, we have hired 5 officers, which is an expansion of about 10% from our existing officer base from Archstone, so including 1 SVP and 4 VPs. So we have tried to improve in certain areas where we thought we had something to learn from Archstone. And we think by bringing on some leadership in some key areas, we're going to be able to do that.","Operator","And your last question comes from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First of all, with the step-up on dispositions, any particular focus, maybe reducing your market exposure, increasing urban exposure, anything like that?","Sean J. Breslin","Mike, this is Sean. Not on a global sense. I'd say it's really pretty pruning around the edges, as I would describe it. So I mean, we're comfortable in terms of our overall allocation to each market. Completing the Archstone acquisition allowed us to sort of be where we wanted to be in terms of macro allocation. Now really comes down to vetting properties within certain submarkets, which submarkets are performing better than others within our markets, and then really asset level performance issues. So it's going to be a sort of trimming around the edges as opposed to anything. I'd say that it's more strategic in nature if you want to think of it that way.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. Tom, what was the debt mark-to-market noncash benefit there in the first quarter and what's kind of the expectation for the second quarter now that you've gone through most of the financing transactions? And then, as we think about CapEx plans for the year, can you kind of give us an update?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Well, in the first question, let me take that one and I might kick the CapEx over to Sean. But as I recall, it was $0.03 a share for just March of the mark-to-market, and it's $0.28 on the entire year, $0.28 per share.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's $0.28 from -- when the transaction closed or $0.28 on an annualized basis?","Thomas J. Sargeant","It's $0.28 for this year.","Timothy J. Naughton","So for 10 months, Mike. So the $0.03, $0.03 a month, we owned it for 1 month this quarter, so $0.03 for Q1 makes sense.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Then final question probably for Tim there. As you look at the Archstone portfolio today having owned it for 2 months, where do you see the most opportunities for improvement kind of over the next couple of years?","Timothy J. Naughton","I think I'll turn that actually to Sean who's -- he obviously oversees it both operationally from an asset management perspective.","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Mike. Sean here again. First, just the second part of your question for Tom on CapEx, in terms of the AvalonBay bucket of CapEx, the expectation is to be sort of where we've been trending, maybe a little bit higher but somewhere in that 700 to 800 home range in terms of recurring CapEx. The expectation for the Archstone assets, given the vintage, as well as some of the product being more high rise, as an example, and mid-rise is probably closer to 900, 950 on a recurring basis. And then in terms of opportunities, we look at it through a few different filters. I think, as I mentioned earlier, we see opportunity across most of the assets in terms of redevelopment potentials, some are more moderate, some are more significant. Certainly in, I'd say, L.A. in the near term is probably the market that offers the most opportunity just because of the size of the portfolio we acquired, and the vintage of the assets there tend to be a little bit older, mid-rise and garden deals. And Southern California, as you guys know, has lagged the rest of the country in their recovery, so we still think there's pretty good rent growth ahead of us in Southern California. So L.A. is probably the biggest opportunity in the near term in the next year or 2.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The portfolio specific as opposed to market specific?","Sean J. Breslin","Portfolio specific, meaning?","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","To operate -- improved operations, redevelopment.","Sean J. Breslin","I would say in redevelopment. Yes, and redevelopment is what I was talking to, there are things we're doing on operational side as well in terms of enhancements, but I was talking about mainly in terms of repositioning of the assets and offensive opportunities. Archstone was investing a lot of capital into the assets in their -- and the state of balance sheet was in the entity they were owned by for a number of years. So they did a fine job maintaining the assets and keeping them up and doing what they needed to do. But there wasn't capital available to capitalize on redevelopment opportunities, and we plan to take advantage of that pretty aggressively.","Operator","There are no further questions queued up at this time. I turn the call back over to Mr. Tim Naughton for closing remarks.","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions]","Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley","Thank you, Vicki and welcome to AvalonBay Communities third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially.

The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities for his remarks.","Tim Naughton","Thanks, Jason. And welcome to our Q3 call, with me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Sean, Matt and I will provide brief commentary on the slides that we posted last night and all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. Our comments this morning will focus on providing a summary of Q3 and year-to-date results, an update on operations including some areas of innovation in the operating platform and then lastly, a review of the development portfolio.","Starting now on Slide 4 highlights for the quarter include core FFO growth of just over 2.5% for the quarter and 3.3% year year-to-date. Same-store revenue growth in Q3 came in at 2.7% or 2.9% including redevelopment with most regions clustered in the 2.5% to 3% range. Year-to-date same-store revenue growth stands at 3.1% or 3.2% including redevelopment. We completed a $90 million community in Seattle this quarter at an initial yield of just over 6%. $335 million so far this year at an average yield of 6.3%. ","We purchased two communities totaling $135 million in the quarter including our third community so far in Southeast Florida, where we also have one development under way. We sold four communities in Q3 totaling $260 million including the last two assets in Texas that were acquired as part of the Archstone transaction. Lastly, in late September, we have entered into a forward contract with $200 million of equity which will be settled over the next year will help fund the remaining cost to complete the development, currently under construction.","And with that now, I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss operations.","Sean Breslin","Okay. Thanks, Tim. Turning to Slide 5. This chart represents the trailing four-quarter average rent change for our same-store portfolio and shows the East and West converging to average roughly 3%. During Q3, however, rent change for our East Coast portfolio was 3.6%, 80 basis points greater than the 2.8% produced by our West Coast assets. The last time our East Coast portfolio outperformed the West from a rent change perspective was Q4 of 2010. ","During Q3, the East Coast portfolio was led by 4.6% rent change in New England, up 50 basis points year-over-year and 3.8% in the mid-Atlantic, up a very healthy 140 basis points year-over-year. On the West Coast, our Pacific Northwest portfolio produced like-term rent change of 4.1%, which was essentially unchanged year-over-year. Northern and Southern California delivered rent change in the 2.5% to 3% range each down more than 100 basis points year-over-year.","Turning to Slide 6, I'd like to highlight a few of the components of revenue growth in the first half and second half of this year. As indicated on the chart, we expect relatively stable rental rate growth which is the primary driver of same-store revenue growth throughout the year. However, as I mentioned during our Q2 call, revenue growth in the first half of this year benefited from the burn off of leased-up concessions from new entrants into the same-store pool, a reduction in bad debt and healthy revenue growth from our retail portfolio. ","In total, these components contributed an incremental 70 basis points to rental revenue growth during the first half of the year. We don't have much of a tailwind from those same components in the second half of the year and the benefit we are realizing has been offset by the impact of rent caps in LA and the recently adopted rent regulations in New York. As a result, revenue growth in the second half of the year is more in line with the actual rental rate growth.","Turning to Slide 7. I'd like to share a little bit about what we're doing on the innovation front, which will enhance our operating margins and allow us to reach new customers. As indicated on the left side of Slide 7, we're leveraging various technologies, our scale and new organizational capabilities to create value through a number of initiatives, including those identified on the right side of the slide. Some of our margin enhancement initiatives relate to leasing and maintenance service, which I'll address in more detail shortly, along with customized renewal offerings and centralized renewal administration. ","In addition we're studying opportunities to use AI, digitalization and various other technologies to improve the productivity of our property management organization, including our call center operation. We're also using our scale and technology to reach new customers. In the residential space, our segmentation studies indicated that roughly 10% of the renter market would prefer a furnished apartment home. We started offering furnished apartment homes in select locations about 18 months ago. Based on early results, we expect to scale at the 5% or more of our portfolio over the next couple of years. ","In addition, we are pursuing a strategy to profitably serve the limited service segment of the rental market through the development of a new community featuring high quality apartment homes and amenity-like design and limited community services. As compared to our typical development community, we expect to reduce capital cost per home via thoughtful design, choice of materials and the elimination of almost all the amenity space.","On the operating side, we expect to reduce operating expenses by eliminating most of the on-site staff as most of the customer interactions would be facilitated by technology and the cost of maintaining what tends to be expensive amenity spaces. The net benefit to the customer is a rental rate approximately 10% to 20% below other new communities in the area. Our first pilot community is currently under construction and we expect initial results in the next 12 months to 18 months.","Turning now to Slide 8 to provide more detail on a couple of initiatives. About 18 months ago, we've mapped out all the customer journey is tied to leasing an apartment and created a new technology enabled self service model for most leasing activities. We started implementing the first phase of our redesign customer journey earlier this year, which includes the use of an AI powered automated leasing agent and the adoption of a more dynamic demand driven staffing model. Our automated agent is now fully deployed across the entire portfolio. The screenshot on the right side of Slide 8 represents a clip of a recent text conversation our agent had with a prospective resident.","The automated agent operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and we're seeing an improved performance metrics as a result of our adoption of this technology including about a 700 basis point improvement and leads to tour conversion ratios. We implemented a staffing model in two regions this year and expect to adopt it across the entire portfolio by the end of next year. ","We're seeing a substantial improvement in productivity across the two pilot regions and expect similar results in our other regions. Other components of the new leasing model include more self-guided tours and self-service move-ins. Overall, we expect to realize about a 50 basis point improvement in our same-store operating margin as a result of our new approach to leasing, which is primarily driven by an increase in the productivity of our leasing teams.","Turning now to Slide 9, we've also created a road map for our new maintenance service mode. There are several phases to the plan, but it includes digitalized workflow and procurement, automated scheduling via new optimization platform, the application of data science to predict demand and enhanced associate performance metrics.","We're in the process of integrating the new maintenance platform with our other enterprise systems, which would allow us to implement the first phase in Q1 2020 and realize stabilization of roughly mid-year 2021. We expect another roughly 50 basis point improvement in our same-store operating margin from our new maintenance service model which is primarily driven by an increase in the productivity of our maintenance teams.","And lastly, turning to Slide 10, I'd also like to provide an update on some of our environmental initiatives. Over the past few years, we have invested in a number of opportunities to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions across our portfolio including LED lighting, which is already generating more than $3 million in annual utility savings and on-site solar generation, which we have started to install more broadly after completing several pilots.","We are on track to have almost 6 megawatts of carbon-free power generating capacity installed by the end of next year, providing strong returns on a $20 million investment and with more opportunity to extend solar to additional assets in future years.","With that, I'll turn it over to Matt to talk about development in Columbus Circle. Matt?","Matt Birenbaum","All right. Great. Thanks, Sean. Our development activity continues to be a strong driver of both NAV and earnings growth even this far into the business cycle. As seen on Slide 11, we currently have $975 million of development that is currently in lease-up or has recently been completed across 10 communities with a weighted average initial stabilized yield based on today's rents and expenses of 6.1%. We believe these assets would be worth roughly $1.3 billion in the private market generating $325 million in value creation on completion, which translates directly into corresponding growth in NAV.","Slide 12 illustrates the future NOI growth we expect as we complete all of the development currently under way. On the left hand side of the slide, you can see that at stabilization we anticipate $60 million in NOI from the $975 million worth of assets shown on the previous slide that are currently in lease-up, plus another $103 million in NOI from the $1.8 billion in assets that are under construction, but not yet in lease-up for a total of $163 million in future NOI to come. And as shown on the right hand side of this slide, this activity is almost completely match funded between our recent forward equity deal, free cash flow and cash on hand. ","In addition, the projected sources of capital as shown does not include proceeds from pending asset sales or condominium unit sales, which we expect to realize in Q1 2020 and which exceed $100 million remaining to fund. With initial yields well above our marginal short-term cost of capital, this development activity is projected to contribute meaningfully to earnings growth over the next two years to three years. Speaking of condominium sales proceeds, slide 13 provides an update on our mixed use building at Columbus Circle in Manhattan, which has been renamed The Park Loggia. ","As we have discussed on prior calls, we began marketing individual apartments in the building as for sale condominiums back in April. And based on the market response to our offering, we can now confirm that we are proceeding with the condominium execution for the residential component. The Park Loggia has been the top selling property in Manhattan since the sales launch and we currently have 40 signed contracts, which we expect will move to settlement in early 2020 once the individual tax lots have been recorded with the city. ","The retail component also continues to be well received by the market with our anchor tenant target opening for business any day now. Of the 67,000 square feet of total retail space available for lease, about 45,500 square feet has been leased so far and we are in advanced negotiations for another 10,300 square feet on the second floor, which would leave us with about 11,000 square feet left to lease, most of which is on the ground floor with Broadway frontage. Ultimately, we expect to generate roughly $10 million in total NOI from the retail component of this project once it reaches stabilization in 2021.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Tim for some concluding remarks.","Tim Naughton","Okay. Thanks, Matt. So in summary, apartment markets remain quite healthy with most markets in balance producing consistent revenue growth of 2.5% to 3% for the first time as Sean mentioned, since late 2010, the East Coast is performing either in line or slightly ahead of the West Coast, we are investing aggressively in our operating platform, leveraging scale, technology and capabilities to grow margins by driving efficiencies and leasing maintenance and utility costs. ","We expect our investments in these areas to stabilize over the next several quarters. And we continue to create significant value through our sector-leading development platform; an activity that's consistently delivered 30%-plus value creation margins over this 10-year expansion cycle and combined with our practice of match funding should contribute meaningfully to earnings growth over the next couple of years.","And with that, Vicki, we are ready to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Sean, you highlighted the rent growth converging. Given what you're seeing today, what are your expectations for the East and West Coast from here. Do you think we'll see sustained rent outperformance in the East Coast over the next 12 months?","Sean Breslin","Yes Nick. Sean here. Good question on that topic. I mean, there's a number of factors out there that kind of relate to the outlook for demand and supply as we move into 2020. On the supply side, if you want to think about it where we're seeing some benefit on the East Coast going into next year for the most part is in New York City where supply is coming down, projected to be roughly in half in 2020 as compared to deliveries in 2019 2018. So, we expect a little bit of benefit there that may be muted to some degree obviously by the rent regulations. ","The first half of next year, we're going to see some impact from that as it bleeds through as you know it started mid-year. So we had the back half of '19 and the first half of 20, we'll see a little bit of dilution from that, but from a pure market fundamentals perspective, if you want to look at it that way, I'd say New York City looks pretty good. Boston, we are going to see more supply in the urban sub-markets of Boston next year. And then as you come down to the Mid-Atlantic, for the most part, things will be roughly at par from a supply standpoint. And if you pivot to the West Coast with the same question, we're expecting more supply in Northern California across all three markets, San Francisco the East Bay and San Jose and a little bit more in LA.","So, if you think about sort of the supply side of it assuming the demand side was relatively stable and there's a number of reasons why you'd expect it to potentially decelerate a little bit from job growth perspective etc. based on macroeconomic factors. Those are the markets where we're probably going to see some change either to the upside or the downside based on the deliveries. The one interesting component I point to is sometimes it's not all just embedded in the jobs data that we see or the supply data that we see. ","So in the Mid-Atlantic as an example it's had a nice tailwind this year. Jobs and supply has been about what we've expected but procurement's up quite a bit and that tends to bring a lot of contractors to the region, so some of those factors that come into play. So net-net, you'd have to look at it sort of market-by-market, but there're good reasons to expect the East Coast to continue to perform well based on what we see whether it's at par, above the West Coast is yet to be seen. So I don't know if you want to add anything to that Tim?","Tim Naughton","Yes. No, I think that's all right, Sean. Yes, I think, Nick, I think one of the things that's sort of remarkable is just how tightly clustered all the markets are while East is slightly outperforming the West. I think what's really striking to us is that it does seem like all the markets performing within 50 basis points or 100 basis points, which I just can't remember a time the cycle where that's occurred. It just seems like we're pretty close to equilibrium almost across the board, which again is kind of remarkable when you think about how supply sort of moves up and down through the course of the cycle in any one market. So it's, I don't know if there's a firm house view that East or West is going to outperform next year as much as the markets are basically in balance and approaching equilibrium for from our view.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. That's very helpful. And then just on the Upper West Side condo sales for the 40 signed contracts. What's the average sales price?","Matt Birenbaum","Yes. Hi, Nick. It's Matt. I don't want to give too much detail, but we do 40 signed contracts. The average price of those particular units is about $2,000,750 and they are in different parts of the building.","Nick Joseph","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go to Rich Hightower with Evercore.","Rich Hightower","Hi, good morning guys.","Matt Birenbaum","Good morning.","Rich Hightower","So, just a question on some of the tech spending that it looks like you guys are ramping up on. I know you've expressed this in terms of basis points of NOI growth impact, but could you maybe translate that into sort of an old-fashioned ROI. What incremental spend do you expect to roll out and what sort of the estimated ROI on all of that, if we take all the categories together?","Sean Breslin","Yes. Rich, this is Sean. I want to give you just a little bit on that in terms of where we are. A number of these things that we're doing particularly, I'll just focus on the leasing and maintenance side for the moment because they're pretty far along as compared to, say, the development communities. They all have their own independent capital budgets that are different when you look at each one kind of on a per home basis. But in terms of sort of the backbone of it on the leasing and maintenance side, the expected investment to deliver the kind of margin enhancement we're talking about, which is roughly 100 basis points is about $10 million. So for a $10 million investment, you can run the math pretty quickly on 100 basis point improvement on operating margin, that's a pretty good ROI.","Rich Hightower","Okay. Yes. We can do that. And then maybe secondly, just in terms of, I think there was an uptick in R&M expense last quarter in a couple of markets. And I know this is part of the larger conversation that we're having in terms of technology and efficiency spending. But, maybe just if you could talk to labor expense growth, not only as a function of the tight job market in general, but also as a function of new supply in your markets. How do those two factors sort of interplay with the labor expense growth in some of those categories?","Sean Breslin","Sure. Yes, happy to address that and maybe a couple of broad comments to begin with. One is, when you look at each quarter here, things can be pretty lumpy. So we tend to add people to really consider focusing on sort of where we are from a year-to-date basis since there's a lot of different things that are happening. So when you look at the quarter, as an example, there is a lot of lumpiness in R&M spend of Q2, late-Q2, Q3 is sort of the peak for when you're completing maintenance projects given the weather, particularly in some of the markets in the Northeast as an example and even here in the Mid-Atlantic and so there tends to be greater spend there. Obviously there's seasonal patterns to turnover that relates to R&M. ","On the marketing side, as an example, we had a substantial call center credit Q3 of last year so if you went looked at Q3 numbers for OpEx and marketing last year, marketing was down about 21%. That's why there's a big increase this year. So, you have to kind of look at it over a period of time, but to address your specific questions around labor, I'm going to give you some sense for us as an example, on the payroll side and we're starting to see some efficiency there, year-to-date, we're up 270 basis points on payroll. About 140 basis points of that just relates to benefits and workers' comp and things like that, that are very lumpy in terms of claims activity and things like that versus 130 basis points is really the sort of organic underlying growth related to the associates in the field. ","And if you consider that, wage growth pick a source is running anywhere from say 3% up to, for our types of folks, if you look at the ADP data maybe even more so. It's pretty constrained labor cost growth on a year-over-year basis. So we've been able to mainly through leveraging on the office side some of the operating model work that we're doing, some of the innovation work that we're doing, taken some FTEs out of the system on the office side, so far to help contain that which is good because the merit pool for our associates is still in the 3% to 4% range on a year-over-year basis for our population.","The one other thing that I would comment on is, there is some pressure in certain markets as it relates to minimum wage regulation and things of that sort. That's putting pressure on the maintenance and labor side for outsourced services. So even though turnover was down as an example, labor rates in some of the markets in Northern California, as an example, Seattle etc.; labor rates are up. So labor component of some of those vendors is up more so than you might like, so we have to try to be as efficient as we can and that's one of the reasons we're investing in the maintenance initiative is to make sure that we're being as efficient as we can not only with our own labor, but with the systems of procurement for the outsource labor as well. So hopefully that addresses a number of your topics there.","Rich Hightower","Yes, that's great color. Thank you, Sean.","Sean Breslin","Yes.","Operator","We'll go to Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill","Hi, good morning guys, a couple of things. Getting back to rent regulation, we've heard some mixed commentary on with some of your peers. So I was wondering if maybe you could think about the impact on revenue breaking down California and New York City or if it's too early to sort of think through that detail.","Sean Breslin","Rich, this is Sean and when you say breakdown, what are you looking for, just kind of what the expected impact of this year or next year...","Rich Hill","Well, really next, yes. So I thought the color in your pitch book post earnings was really helpful where there is an offset. So, that was helpful to understand. I'm trying to understand, do you think California or New York is more onerous? We sort of look at New York City is being more onerous and obviously you've talked about decreasing your exposure to that market. I think the market was thinking California at 5%-plus inflation wasn't that big of a deal, it sounds like it's having some headwinds. So I'm just trying to quantify that offset and how much of it's driven by California versus New York?","Sean Breslin","Okay. So yes, let me give you just a brief summary on each one to give you some perspective. So what we talked about on the last quarter call as it relates to New York is that we expected the same-store impact in the second half of 2019 to be about $1 million. And about 80% of that is derived from loss of all the fee income that we can generate for application fees and things of that sort. As you may recall, so it will reduce the growth rate in the New York-New Jersey region by about 25 basis points for the full year and the growth for the full year in the same-store portfolio is really about 6 basis points or 7 basis points, but since it's all concentrated in the second half, the impact is about 10 basis points or 11 basis points. ","So, for New York, that's for the second half of this year, we would expect a similar impact roughly in the first half of next year and so you get to the second half of 2020 where you have year-over-year comps that are a little more stable because you have an impact, second half of '19. The impact would be in place the second half of 2020. So then projecting it beyond that, it's a little bit of a mathematical jigsaw puzzle in terms of different things that you expect where you are in terms of legal rent today across your portfolio etc. So I do think you're going to get different answers from each of the REIT owner-operators as it relates to their assets and the potential impact. ","So I'm not surprised that you're hearing different things about that, but that's sort of how it looks in New York. And keep in mind for us as it relates to the rent stabilization component of it as opposed to the fee component which is statewide, the stabilization side impact about 21,000 units, and for us about 10 years from now, those 421-a programs burn off and then we'd be free of that. So that's how to think about it for our portfolio in New York. In terms of AB 1482 in California, it is a couple of different ways to look at it. ","First is we went back and sort of back tested our portfolio in 2018 and 2019, and said if AB 1482 has been adopted in either one of those years, what would the impact have been? And if you back tested that way, for us, it would have been about a 20 basis point impact for each of Northern and Southern California. That's about 40% of our portfolio. So call it 8 basis points roughly for the full year. ","And then probably the other relevant question is you know given the reset on January 1, 2020, how does that impact your embedded growth rate for 2020? And what we've done today as we basically said look if it went into effect October 1st and we had to reset leases back to Q1 of 2019 which is the regulation. It has about a 5 basis point drag on our embedded growth.","So it's not, that's on the same-store pool overall. So it's not terribly meaningful, but it's going to look certainly a little bit more meaningful in those markets, and then beyond that, it's really a function of the market environment, whether you're hitting the caps or not, but the piece that tends to come into play that people don't always think about is not just the CPI piece, but there are short-term lease extensions month to month leases various things like that, that have kept our ability to generate more premium revenue. ","And so, I'm not sure if everybody is recognizing that at this point, but it tends to be a material impact and we mentioned that this year as an example, the impacts some of the rent caps in LA because of the fire was about $1 million because we couldn't do those short-term leases very profitably. So, you have to look at all those different components. That's a lot of detail, maybe more than you need. But that's kind of how we're looking at it right now.","Rich Hill","No. That's I think the transparency that I was certainly looking for. So thank you for that. One quick follow-up question and I apologize if you mentioned this on the prepared remarks, maybe I missed it. And I recognize you don't give quarterly guides but it looks like the full year guide imply some pretty healthy growth in FFO year-over-year in 4Q '19. Is there anything specific driving that that we should think about.","Kevin O'Shea","Hi, Rich, this is Kevin O'Shea. We typically do see a ramp in core FFO as we progress through the year because of our development and focus specifically as it relates to the ramp from 3Q '19 to 4Q '19. The sequential growth and expected core FFO is being primarily driven by seasonal operating expenses and by development NOI for lease-up communities. So those are the two main drivers of the increase.","Rich Hill","Got it, got it. Thank you, guys. That's it from me.","Operator","We'll go to Jeff Spector with Bank of America.","Jeff Spector","Good morning. Thank you. I had a follow-up question on supply. You mentioned, New York City next year, I think for your exposure down 50%. Can you put some numbers around some of the West Coast markets you discussed that you said you mentioned some I guess, qualitatively, some comments around supply, but do you have any stats.","Sean Breslin","Yes. Sure, Jeff. This is Sean. Happy to do that. So on the West Coast market specifically, we are expecting basically flat deliveries in Seattle. But in terms of Northern California, I mentioned supply deliveries across all the market, it's about 1,000 units more in San Francisco, about 1800 in East Bay, about 1500 in San Jose and then in LA it's about 2800 units. A lot of that concentrated in around Downtown, Korea town, Hollywood, West Hollywood, a little bit on the West side. And in the other markets, happy to go through some of the sub-markets with you offline, if that's helpful, but those are kind of really the big chunks.","Jeff Spector","That's helpful. Thanks. And we've seen slippage each year for the last few years. Is there a chance that any of that slips into '21 or is this is the supply more front loaded first half '20?","Sean Breslin","No, it's pretty, it's spread relatively evenly across the quarters. So, to your point based on what we've seen historically, we would expect some of that absolutely. Our rule of thumb has been somewhere in the 10% to 15% range based on what we've seen sort of historical experience. So give you some perspective. And I'd say more delays in kind of the urban high rise product, more so than the suburban wood-frame.","Jeff Spector","Thanks. And then just one follow-up on demand. I know you talked about, obviously unemployment is low and so job growth has slowed but wage growth for your renter has been strong. So how are you thinking about that in terms of pushing rents? I don't know if you can give any comments on maybe what you're putting out for renewals over the next 30 days, 60 days out?","Sean Breslin","Yes, this is Sean. Happy to jump on that and Tim or others can chime in. But yes, historically when we look at a wage growth, it is most highly correlated with rent growth. Job growth is sort of the number two variable in that equation. And so we are seeing people come in with healthy wage gains, but we tend to look at is, for the people that move into our apartment communities, January of 2019. What their income level is relative to those that will move into January of 2020 and how much is it moving as an example, that's kind of how we measure it. ","We don't necessarily get income levels from every renewal, but people are seeing healthy wage growth is certainly in line with what we're seeing in the raw data, whether it's the BLS data or the ADP data. I kind of referenced kind of 3.5% earlier when we're talking about wage growth. But in the ADP data, professional services, financial services, etc., tech those numbers on paper are closer to 6%, 7% wage growth that may or may not include some of the stock option income, things of that sort, but we're seeing healthy wage growth. And certainly that influences how we think about it, but to the extent of the supply in the market, they have choices. So it really comes down to how we think the demand supply environment looks.","Right now in terms of renewal offers though, to answer the specific question, we're talking about stuff in the mid-5% to high-5% range for November and December in terms of where renewal offers are going out and renewals have been relatively fall year kind of in the mid-4% to high-4% range. And I would expect that to be the case as we continue to move through the fourth quarter as well.","Tim Naughton","Hi, Jeff. Tim. Just maybe one thing to add. I think you're right in terms of our population, the income growth has been quite decent relative to maybe the 3%, 3.5% for the overall population. I think one of the thing to consider is what's happening on the for sale side. Affordability has become more challenging is up until the last quarter or two, where the Case-Shiller has been outpacing I've been outpacing rent growth. So I think that's helped rental demand. Some of the margin, you're now seeing, I think a Case-Shiller had a print this morning, right around 2%. You're now seeing sort of for sale inflation, housing inflation start to fall more in line with the with rent growth. ","So overall, I think our outlook is it's a pretty balanced housing market not just across each of the geographic markets, but between for sale and per rental you're starting to see relatively flattish movement in home ownership rates, might be up one quarter down the next quarter. So it really is remarkable. Just in terms of the overall housing market, just kind of how in equilibrium it is right now and maybe that shouldn't be surprise sort of 10 years into an expansion, but it's about as stable as I can remember seeing it.","Jeff Spector","Thank you.","Operator","Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets is next.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi. Good morning, everyone. You guys have spent some time talking about the convergence in like-term rent change across kind of the East Coast and West Coast but this was really the first quarter this year that we've seen that like-term effective rent change be below where it was at this time last year. And I wouldn't think some of the headwinds, you've talked about same-store revenue growth related to other incomes and lower bad debt would necessarily show up in that figure. So I'm just curious what's driving that moderation and how should we think about that moving forward.","Tim Naughton","Yes. Austin, this is Tim. I think it's just demand overall. I mean, if you've seen an economy sort of downshift from 3% growth to roughly currently 2% growth job growth more in the 1.5% range now running about 2 million jobs versus we were in the mid-2s before. So household formation has been pretty good. But I think it's just the overall economic activity being down a little bit because supply as, Sean mentioned, has been relatively stable. Obviously there's shifts from market to market, but overall across our market footprint it's been relatively stable. I think just economic activity and job growth is down a little bit, that's probably what's impacting the margin the most.","Austin Wurschmidt","And so, it's safe to assume that's mostly on the new lease side because you've talked about kind of that mid-4% to high-4% range for renewals being fairly stable. So just traffic overall is down a bit","Sean Breslin","Yes, no. This is Sean. I mean I wouldn't think too much about traffic because traffic is something that we can either engineer up or down depending on how much you spend and things like that. I think if you look at really what's happened with rent change where you're seeing lift, the lift is in the Mid-Atlantic and as I mentioned, job growth has been about the same, but there's been a substantial increase in procurement from the government, that brings in a lot of contractors that gives you a little bit better lift than we might have anticipated, but we're down in Northern and Southern California is more just a function of demand because the supply is pretty much what we expected. And if you see where it is, it's pretty widespread. So you can't just point to one particular market or sub-market and say that's kind of driving it, it's pretty broad, which generally is more macroeconomic oriented.","Austin Wurschmidt","I appreciate the thoughts. And then, just second one from me is Matt you provided a good bit of detail on kind of the limited spend you've got within the development pipeline here, but I'm curious what does that figure on the remaining spend look like once you commence the remaining starts you've targeted for 2019. And I think you've got north of $1 billion being completed in 2020. So can you, if you factor all of that in, what's kind of that future spend look like.","MattBirenbaum","Yes, I'll speak to that quickly and then I don't know if Kevin wants to add anything. Obviously, we haven't provided any guidance in terms of what our starts might be next year. I think this year we're expected to start $400 million to $500 million additional here in the fourth quarter. So, some of which has been spent already but most of which has not. So I guess if you project it out to a year-end you probably add that and then you take out spend that we would incur over this quarter on the stuff that's currently under way. So it might tick up a little bit, but as I mentioned we also have not only condo sales but pending disposition asset sales proceeds coming in the first quarter as well that aren't even in those numbers.","Kevin O'Shea","Austin, this is Kevin. One way to think about our business is if we're kind of starting somewhere close to $1 billion a year in development and spending about $100 million, $150 million or so a redevelopment we're spending about $100 million in the investment side of the house; everyone. So it certainly moves around a little bit, but if you're just trying to get a general sense of kind of what that flow of investment activity looks like for us, it's probably a ballpark number somewhere in the $100 million a month in terms of investment spend.","Austin Wurschmidt","That's helpful, thanks guys.","Operator","Next is Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.","Trent Trujillo","Yes. Hi. Good morning. This is Trent on with Nick. Matt going back to The Park Loggia condos, you mentioned the average sales price so far is a little lower than the average targeted sales price for the building so with perhaps some higher priced units still left to go and some softness in the higher priced market, what kind of sales trajectory do you anticipate whether on a monthly or quarterly basis?","Matt Birenbaum","Yes, sure Trent. Yes, so first of all, it's going great. Over the past six months we've been running 27 visits a week, Corcoran Sunshine is marketing them for us. They are average across all the deals, they're marketing in Manhattan is 7 visits a week. So we're getting a lot of traffic. It helps that the product is there and people can actually see it and we're close to being able to have people buy and settle. So, they're not buying off of plans and particularly going into next year and not going to be buying and having to wait a significant amount of time. So yes, I mean I think when we launched, we said we figure the average price across the whole building was roughly $3 million a unit. The ones we've sold so far are $2.75 million. ","So you're right. I mean that average is skewed a little bit by some super premium units at the very top of the building and those will sell when they sell. So, it's hard to predict or project when those might sell and they will move the need a little bit. So while we sold so far, on average, there has been a nice balance across the building, but a little bit more kind of at the bottom of the building than the top so far. We hope to be able to continue at reasonable pace. We think we've got a compelling value proposition to the market. Obviously we'll have to see how it goes. Right now, where we stand is any day now we expect the plan to be declared effective by the Attorney General, which is a process that frankly we thought would take two week or three weeks, it's probably more like five weeks or six weeks. ","And then we have to go to getting the tax loss recorded by the City Assessor's office and that process is taking a little longer than we had originally anticipated. So the market response and everything has been as we expected, kind of, even as of the beginning of the year. It's just taking us a little longer to get to the legal place where we can start settlements, because of that two-step process of the AG. And then the City Assessor's office and, I guess there's a back up in the City Assessor's office so that's taking just a little longer than we had thought, projected going in. But again, we're well on track for settlements first quarter and we continue to make sales at that pace of roughly four to six a month and we've seen that, we haven't seen any slowdown yet in our sales pace even here through October.","Trent Trujillo","That's very good detail. Thank you. Maybe just sticking with that a little bit on the retail space, looks like you're making progress on that as well. Can you talk about the new tenants being added or maybe how you're viewing the overall mix and what you're targeting on the remaining available space?","Matt Birenbaum","A little bit. Sure. I mean we have target. As I mentioned, I think should be opening any day now. Our first tenant on the second floor Financial Services, I think they're getting ready to open here before the end of the year as well. We have one of the additional ground floor space that's leased to a high quality credit tenant that should start their build out here probably in January, and we've got a couple of tenants we're talking to, actually in pretty far advanced negotiations about the remaining space on the second floor; different use groups. One is kind of a restaurant use group and other is more of a fitness use group. So we have some interesting options there and then we'll see about the remainder of the ground floor space. ","We continue to get interest from various folks. So it's kind of an interesting mix of different, different tenancies. We do think Target will attract further interest just because they're going to drive a lot of traffic. Now obviously that location gets a tremendous amount of street, pedestrian traffic anyway. So again, things are proceeding nicely. We are getting nice interest and the NOI from that is going to take a couple of years to phase in as those final spaces get leased.","Trent Trujillo","Okay. And maybe just one more if I may. With the development rates increasing to over $4.2 billion, how are you I guess viewing that development pipeline, if that pilot initiative, you mentioned about an amenity-like community if that's successful, does that change how you're looking at where to develop or how to develop maybe some color on that would be helpful.","Matt Birenbaum","Yes, this is Matt. Again, it's probably a little too early to say. We do have one community under construction, that's kind of our pilot test case for it and we're going to see what the market response is. We're going to validate kind of what those margins look like. So the way I would think about it is it's another tool in the toolkit. We haven't really underwritten any of deals in the pipeline to that model, but I think it could improve or particularly on larger sites where we might have multiple phases, it gives us the opportunity to segment the market a little more and provide kind of different price points and different service offerings, which can help on the development economics and if it's validated it could open up other sites for us over time.","Trent Trujillo","Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks for the time.","Operator","We'll go to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thank you. Your expected development yield on your development pipeline has been trending down below 6%. I'm wondering if this is the reflection of higher costs, the mix of the projects or have you changed any of your rental assumptions at all.","Matt Birenbaum","Sure, John. This is Matt. I mean it is a reflection of the basket that's under construction at any given point in time, some of which is product and geographic mix. So that will tend to move around a little bit over time. It is, in some respects, a reflection of, we are 10 years into the cycle and certainly as we've said for a while construction costs have been growing faster than rent. So it is getting harder to find deals and deals on balance, might be a little tighter, although there is still very strong value creation in the stuff that we're creating as we've talked about. And by the way, our cost of capital is down quite a bit over the last two or three quarters as well.","John Kim","Got it. Okay. And then a follow-up on the limited service offering that you're testing out, how do you think this will impact returns. Do you foresee this being a lower growth product with a higher exit cap rate, offset by lower costs or do you think basically the IRRs would be pretty similar to your kind of product?","Matt Birenbaum","It's really too early to tell, John. I mean, again, we view it as there is a customer segment out there that's probably being under-served today because 99% of the new product that's built is being heavily amenitized and the concept is to provide the same apartment itself high-end finishes and strong labs but just less of the other trappings, the bells and whistles that our research would suggest there's lots of customers that want the nice apartment but don't necessarily value all those other things, which have a lot of first cost and a lot of hidden costs over time as well, which may be are under-appreciated by the market. So it's hard to say how that might impact valuation or cap rates. I don't see any reason why its rent growth would be significantly different than the rest of the market. And it does seem like asset valuation is primarily just driven by the cash flow it can generate. So I'm not sure I would expect anything significantly different there but time will tell.","John Kim","Is there another developer or developers out there who you are emulating for that product or are you basically being a leader?","Matt Birenbaum","Yes, I mean, it does require some upfront investment in technology to enable it and some back of house service, for example, one of the reasons we think we can do this profitably is because it really leverages our call center down in Virginia Beach. So we may not have an on-site presence for leasing. Some of that's tech enabled, but some of that's also that they can call the CCC and interact with somebody that way. So I'm not familiar with others that are trying this.","Tim Naughton","Yes. Hi, John, this is Tim. I guess I mean still most of the production is coming from merchant builders it tend to be a little more risk-averse and if they've got a customer and institutional buyer who is accustomed to buying a highly amenitized building, they're less likely to sort of take that risk in terms of doing something different. But as Matt mentioned, we are on customer research. We have plenty of customers that are paying more today in our existing assets and sort of any with value because they're not necessarily using all the amenities, or all the services that we're providing and we've done enough research to know that they would like something less, but they don't want to compromise on the quality of their unit and the quality of the finishes. So it's really just even taking the existing customer base we have today and continue to segment it and provide them something we think that's a better match for what they value.","Matt Birenbaum","It is also one of the advantages we've talked about being such an active developers. We do have the ability to create the product that may be more in tune with what certain segments in the market will value as opposed to just being limited to buy what somebody else has built.","John Kim","Thanks for the color.","Operator","We will go to John Glennie with Stifel. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","Great, thank you. Quick question, if you look at your retail, I think you said maybe a $10 million stabilized NOI and you cap that at 5% so you say that's worth $200 million. It looks like your basis in the multi-family now condos is about $426 million or $2.5 million a unit. Is it safe to say that you breakeven on this one is all said and done, if you value the retail at $200 million?","Tim Naughton","John, this is Tim. I think our expectation, I think we've shared before is that we thought there is between $100 million-$150 million of incremental value here. So no, we do expect to we do expect to make money. If the retail were valued at $200 million, Matt mentioned the average unit that's sold today is about $2.75 million, but that's not where the average unit is priced today, so based upon current pricing there is incremental profit over above a breakeven scenario.","John Guinee","Right, OK. And then a follow-up on your furnished units, are you going from 0% to 5% in couple of years? And what's the big change of heart to decide that furnished units have merit?","Sean Breslin","Yes. John, this is Sean. I mean a couple of things, one is in terms of why it has merit. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do a fair amount of consumer research and we identified about 10% of the market actually that has some level of interest in a furnished apartment home either expressed interest or will consider it. And so, we've, just anecdotally we've had that people come in looking for furnished apartments, but we have tested the last 18 months across the sample of communities in our portfolio. ","We are seeing some pretty steady demand and therefore, we do think it's a profitable opportunity. So, to be able to scale it, we'll have a team together here to do that and getting to that 5% mark could take yet two years to three years depending on the pace at which we decided to go. So as we scale it from where we are today, which is call it 300, 400 units type of thing to something that will be more substantial. You probably won't grow in a linear fashion or probably get to about 1,000 and then we will go much faster.","Tim Naughton","Hi John, maybe just to add a couple of thing. I think there's a couple of other things that worked and once just changing consumer preference, particularly among those under 35. We just don't want to own as much stuff is or don't need to own as much stuff as perhaps as generations pass. So I think that's piece. I think another piece of it is there just aren't that many companies that have the scale that we do that can actually make a business out of this. So if you're fund that owns 5,000 or 10,000 units, you're probably not going to make a big investment into this business versus somebody that owns 80,000 units or 100,000 units. So I think it's kind of a combination of those two things that's created what we think is an appealing business opportunity.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","Thanks, Sean. On Page 5 the like-term effective rent change if you swapped out the East Coast versus West Coast and just showed urban versus suburban, what does the 2019 recent trajectory look like if you zoomed in on that?","Sean Breslin","Yes. So if you're looking at, just for our portfolio John, as compared to the market overall.","John Pawlowski","Just AvalonBay's suburban versus urban portfolio.","Sean Breslin","Yes. So suburban versus urban, they basically were flat on a year-over-year basis, 2.7% when you look at it from that perspective. And that has changed and that doesn't include all the assets, because they're classified different ways. There's infill suburban and suburban. So this is true definition of strictly urban true definition of strictly urban versus strictly suburban, and throwing out TOD and all those kind of things. So it's not going to line up with the 3.2% for the full quarter. But if you look at the pure urban and pure suburban the way we would define it, they are similar. Down in the past, obviously that's been very different over the last four quarters, but it has converts as well. So as Tim indicated, whether you're looking at AB, you're looking at urban or suburban or are you looking across the different markets, just sort of a similar pattern of convergence across all those variables.","John Pawlowski","Okay. And Tim, curious to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about the trajectory starts moving forward as you had tug-of-war between the improved cost of capital that Matt alluded to and then perhaps some flashing yellow lights in the economy and just which those variables are winning out in your mind right now?","Tim Naughton","John, I mean it's one of the reasons why we do match fund, so to the extent you match funding in some ways, it's not that different than your stabilized portfolio. You've got the risk rate of the assets that you, 80,000 apartments that you already owned. But those are completely funding finance, but the same is pretty much true in everything that we start from a developer standpoint. So if anything I think as you get later in the cycle, it just puts us more position of what we've talked about in the past. Just be flexible, try to have as many option, contracts as you can to give you some flexibility to potentially to either to drop a deal or to renegotiate a deal or to push it out and we don't have any land inventory to speak up. ","So, we could always if we had to sort of buy a land and sit on it. But right now, when you're talking about 6% projected yields against where our incremental marginal cost of capital is, we think it's still, we think it's still makes sense and that asset values are still well above replacement costs in most of our markets. So it's m ore, it's been more of the opportunity set, we've been adding about $1 billion a year in new development rights and we've been starting about a $1 billion in our, private focus on that probably as much as anything when that pipeline maybe start to dry up because we're just not seeing value in the land markets.","John Pawlowski","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates is next.","Hardik Goel ","Hi guys, how are you? Thanks for taking my question. I've just got two for you. Matt, you've been a veteran in multifamily development for a long time and I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you see the regulatory environment today versus maybe five, 10 or maybe even 15 years ago across all markets, not just California and maybe talk about which markets have the greatest barriers on a regulation standpoint versus which ones are the best?","Matt Birenbaum","Sure. There are some interesting cross currents there and you see it obviously in the other side of it which is the rent control and in many ways, it's the regulations that have created in many of our markets, part of the environment that's provided for the supply constraints and in turn have driven rent growth to be well in excess of inflation over a sustained period of time. The barriers to entry are still very, very high in California. The sequel process, particularly if you're starting something from scratch, the amount of money you have to have in a project, but by the time you get it through, if anything the dollar investment has gone up, which in turn makes it very difficult for merchant builders to hang in there through that time period.","The legal challenges that we see, so the barriers in California, I think are as high as ever, they may be higher in LA now with JJJ passing a couple of years ago and some of the labor requirements that have been put on top of that. If you think about like around here in the Mid-Atlantic, I'd say the barriers this cycle is lower than prior cycles and some of that frankly is better landed as planning, as some of the local jurisdictions here have really focused on transit oriented development and frankly from a public policy point of view, one of the benefits been less rent growth this cycle has been great as a landlord, but maybe it improve the economic competitiveness of the region on long-term. ","So some cross currents there and then in some of our very constrained markets in the Northeast, they're just different cross currents both directions in New Jersey, there is kind of a one-time once every 20 year opportunity to get a little more supply in the suburbs and land suburbs because of some affordable housing litigation and regulation, which is having some teeth and we've been able to take advantage of that and get a bunch of sites in some sub-markets that haven't seen much supply for generation. So you may see a little bit more there over the next 5 years or 10 years. ","Conversely, in Boston, suburban Boston, where we've had success for a lot of years with what they called Chapter 40B there which is a similar provision that forces small towns and jurisdictions to take a certain amount of affordable housing, which we then integrate into our market rate communities. 40B, a lot of the suburban Boston jurisdictions have met our obligation now. So if anything we've seen, we saw more supply there over the prior couple of cycles, than we may see over the next cycle because of that. So it really does vary from region to region.","Sean Breslin","Steve, I guess, maybe one thing to add and maybe it's implied in Matt's comments, the regulatory barriers are just higher in the suburbs than the urban areas, maybe with the exception of LA, as Matt mentioned. Certainly true in the Northeast, certainly true in California, what has been remarkable this cycle is in urban markets, it's generally been an economic barrier, financial barrier not a regulatory barrier and that's certainly been the case and one of the reasons why you've seen, why we've seen elevated supply in our markets this cycle versus prior cycles because it's made financial sense and oftentimes, it's been highest and best use relative to condominium, relative to office, relative to hotel. ","I think this cycle condos have only accounted for about 5% of multifamily supply and prior cycles has been closer to a quarter of new supply. So I think there's been a, I think a few things that are a bit more unique about the cycle, but I think it's still continue to be largely the suburban Northeast California markets that are toughest to penetrate from regulatory standpoint.","Hardik Goel ","Thanks guys. That's probably the best response I received for that question, so thank you for that. And just my second one is pretty easy; just splitting out the blended lease over lease, rent by new and renewal. And maybe talking about pricing power in the fourth quarter, realizing that it is a low leasing volume quarter?","Matt Birenbaum","Yes, in terms of Q3, specifically in terms of the breakout, as I mentioned, it was a blended 3.2%, it was 4.6% on renewals and for my comment earlier, it's been pretty stable all year we expect it to be also relatively stable in the fourth quarter and then the move-ins, it was 1.7% during the quarter and that typically is the metric that from a seasonal basis tends to drift down as you move through Q4 and Q1 and peaks as you get into kind of late Q2 or early Q3 and we don't see any reason for that pattern to be any different going forward over the next few quarters.","Hardik Goel ","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Drew Babin with Baird is next.","AlexKubicek","Good morning, this is Alex on for Drew. Just one quick modeling question for us, it looked like a pretty sizable quarter when it came to Asset Preservation CapEx. I thought the run rate in the current year-to-date pace, it looks like year-to-year growth could be over 18%, obviously rising costs and some seasonality that play here, but I was just curious what's driving that growth and if you have any color you can provide us on how we should expect that to trend in 4Q and into '20?","Sean Breslin","Yes, Alex, this is Sean. Similar to what I talked about our maintenance projects, it tends to be seasonality of the CapEx as well, the way I'd probably think about it from a modeling perspective is 2019 maintenance CapEx is probably going to be in the range of 5% to 6% of NOI. There is a piece of that that we call remerchandising that is sort of a refresh of amenity spaces and such that you could probably say that has some return to it, although hard to quantify. But if you use that 5% to 6% of NOI is sort of a run rate, that's about right, it'll be a little bit lumpy from year-to-year. But that's sort of how we're looking at it.","Alex Kubicek","That's helpful. Thanks.","Sean Breslin","Yes.","Operator","We'll go to Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb ","Hi, good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. Just two quick ones for me. First upfront, I didn't hear it but maybe I got lost. Your OpEx for the year, your guidance of $2.1 to $2.7, you're trending $2.8 for the year. So what are the items in the fourth quarter they're going to bring it down or is the trend sort of what it is, but within your overall FFO guidance, you're able to manage the higher OpEx?","Sean Breslin","Yes. Alex, this is Sean. We haven't changed our guidance and so, as I mentioned earlier, every quarter is a little bit lumpy. Q3 was lumpy for a number of reasons related to R&M projects that are done in certain seasons of the year. I mentioned marketing is up dramatically because of a substantial credit we credit we received last year when marketing was down 21%, insurance renewal bleed through payroll, we continue to see good reductions in FTEs. As a result of the initiatives I mentioned. So I would say at this point, we're pretty comfortable with where we are.","Kevin O'Shea","Okay. Kevin here. One more thing to think about as you as you evaluate sort of the year-over-year growth rates in OpEx is it's obviously you need to look at what happened. The prior year and last year in the fourth quarter of '18, we had a pretty tough comp with year-over-year growth in OpEx at 50 basis points, so that as probably a key driver of the 4.2% this year. So I think there is the lumpiness that Sean alluded to, not only in terms of what we spend, but it's sort of what happened in the prior year. So you need to kind of incorporate that into modeling.","Alexander Goldfarb ","Okay, that's helpful. And then second is just going back to the new initiative you're trying on the sort of amenity light and people light properties I understand the point about amenities you walk the buildings and certainly there's a lot of space that doesn't get used, but I would think that part of what makes the REITs different from others especially you guys to be able to charge a premium rents it sort of that in person customer service. So in your testing is there no diminishment of what the tenants will pay relative to not having the people around them, they feel they're being catered to or how do you make that trade-off between the premium rents versus giving people that experience that they're absolutely being catered to if they have a maintenance request or have a package request or anything like that.","Matt Birenbaum","Yes, I know Alex I'll respond to that one than anyone else can chime in if they like, but we've done a fair bit of work on this in terms of consumer research, both through surveys focus groups shadows, a lot of different things we engaged some consultants to work with us on this and what you find might be a little surprising, which is if you think about kind of consumerism today what people experience whether it's buying a car today, whether it's shopping through Amazon whether it's lot of other things, they kind of want to be able to do things when they want to do it on their own as opposed to being dependent upon someone else holding their hand all the way through, and for the most part, they actually don't want that unless they specifically needed for a purpose. ","And so all of our consumer research is that like from a leasing standpoint, do they want to come in and meet a salesperson and spend an hour touring the community with a sales person in kind of selling them along the way for the most part, the answer is no. They want to see everything they can, online and if they want to schedule a tour they want to go there. When they want to go there. Regardless of the office hours, they really don't want someone to show us or show them around except for one segment kind of a mature social segment, so that fits and then on the maintenance and service side. It's more, what's the right level of service. ","You're absolutely correct that some segments want the 24 hour response in the white glove service, but there is a decent chunk of the market that doesn't necessarily value that and may be perfectly fine with, they have picked something the dishwasher isn't working today, they don't cook a lot, they're fine if it 24 hour to 48 hour service as long as you give them the option to tell you how important is to them to have that thing fixed, it never responsive to their demand. The network just fine. ","So I think it's just segmenting the market in a more fine way so that the people they really do value those things are paying for it and the people that don't value those things aren't paying for it. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, absent the amenity space which not only has capital cost, but pretty heavy recurrent costs for OpEx and OpEx and sort of the on demand service as opposed to the continuous services high responsive, they can see rent, it's 10% to 20% lower than a brand new building down the street and there's definitely a segment of the market that would prefer that option. So I don't know Tim, you want to add anything.","Tim Naughton","Yes. No, I think you hit it, if anyone else want to jump in. I mean lower rent is part of the value proposition here and I don't think necessarily low touch necessarily as necessarily means low levels of service. I think you're going to have high level of service with high tech in sort of a low touch kind of offering. So I think it depends on the issue. Alex, but part of the value proposition is absolutely that they would pay a lower price on a comparable community that would be more amenitized and more fully staffed.","Alexander Goldfarb ","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Linda Tsai with Jefferies.","Linda Tsai ","Hi, thanks for taking my question. The technologically driven efficiencies you're driving in leasing and maintenance, apologies if you've discussed this previously, is this thing across the entire portfolio or just a portion. I'm just wondering how much opportunity exist to reduce expenses further through these types of initiatives?","Sean Breslin","Yes, Linda, this is Sean. The expectation is that we would deploy it across the portfolio, it might have slightly different nuances across certain buildings dependent on the customer segment that's in that building. So, as we were just talking about the limited service offering, that'd probably be one extreme there'll be another buildings maybe as a high touch, very high rent building that could be the other extreme, but we expect to deploy a lot of it across 95% of our portfolio where people have the option to self-serve, that's sort of the default. But if they would like a tour, they can schedule one at a time that's convenient for them and things like that. So we're taking advantage of the opportunity across the entire portfolio, and we may, different usage of certain services or needs for leasing etc., based on the customer profile at each one.","Linda Tsai ","Thanks for that clarification. And then on The Park Loggia, could you talk about the different, how different the retail rents are between the four levels shown on slide 13 and then what's the average term for the leases you've signed?","Matt Birenbaum","Yes, hi, Linda. This is Matt. The rents are very different, between the four levels. I think we provided some high level thoughts about that maybe a year or so ago on a call but you're talking about, its the highest rents are on the ground floor with the Broadway frontage, the second floor might be 40% to 50% of that rent, and then the basement and sub-basement would be maybe the basements little bit less than that and the sub-basement quite a bit less than that. So it really does vary based on the specific space. The lease term are generally long-term leases. I think one of our anchor lease, the first two leases were, I don't remember exactly, I think they were probably 20-year terms or I think with some extension options beyond that probably, I probably can't get into terms for specific leases, but generally speaking, they have been relatively long-term.","Linda Tsai ","Thanks for that. And then just a final one. The demand for fully furnished apartments can we assume the economics are more attractive for leasing these units if there are fewer of these units available across the market.","Sean Breslin","Yes, there's less supply of those units. So there certainly would be a premium associated with the furnished product, of course.","Linda Tsai ","Okay, thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now go to Haendel St Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Haendel St. Juste","Hi, good morning or good afternoon. I just want to follow up on Linda's question, can you talk about the premium you're looking for here or maybe give us some sense of required ROI. We're talking about a lot of furniture here and also curious if you're thinking or should we expect that to be expensed capitalized? Thanks.","Sean Breslin","Yes. Haendel, this is Sean. So just a couple of things. We've been testing a variety of different premiums. What I can tell you that's out there is, if you went to a third party. Operator. Marriott has a product from others do typically what you'd find is the rent for our furnished unit relative to the base rent of typical unit that's comparable would be about double that's a company that is taking inventory risk and signing different leases and things of that sort. We are the own inventory risk so we probably think about a little bit differently, but I wouldn't be surprised if we said we could generate 50% premiums above the base rent for a unit to that customer to include the various services, maybe some, utilities and with cord cutting may not need to provide cable, but in some cases, you do. ","And then as it relates to your specific question around the furniture there'll be capitalized but then depreciated over probably a five-year to seven-year period. At this point we're depreciated over five year, we think that's a reasonable proxy. We've been talking to others including some of the student housing rates in terms of what to expect in that area it seems to be five years to seven years is sort of the expected range for useful life, so it's going to come back at 1% a year or so\u2026","Tim Naughton","Yes Haendel, Tim here. Just to be clear in terms of the premium, if you get a 50% premium. Some of that would be for the furniture. Yes, I'm going to be premium based for a short-term nature of these leases tend not to be, on average tend to be less than a year or 24 months, which our average residents days. I think to-date, it's been closer to six months to seven months, Sean. So there is a return, sort of that additional vacancy exposure that's factored into that 50% premium as well.","Haendel St. Juste","That's helpful, thanks. Because I was thinking some of those numbers sounded more like shorter term corporate units but appreciate that color.","Tim Naughton","Yes. No, I think that's right. I think some of the premiums when you hear like to 2x, a lot of times, that is a very, very short-term certainly\u2026","Sean Breslin","Yes, there's like the operator that might be taking a 12 month lease but their leasing 30 days at a time type of thing. We would certainly have some of that business, but just, we want to manage that exposure appropriately from lease expiration profile standpoint and so far we've been serving customers that are interested in something that's slightly longer.","Haendel St. Juste","Got it, got it. Okay, thank you. Appreciate that. And then I wanted to go back to some of your earlier comments on supply first in LA, it seems like much supply coming online is more focused downtown so curious what you're thinking about and thinking about for your more suburban SoCal portfolio, you're a bit more in the Pasadena Burbank Orange County. So I'm curious how you're thinking about the performance of your more suburban portfolio versus say downtown LA. And then maybe some similar commentary on Boston, we're again, your portfolio is a bit more suburban versus the urban core there with the supply seems to be coming on more. Thanks.","Sean Breslin","Yes, sure happy to talk about that briefly, maybe starting in reverse order in Boston. Correct. Most of the increase in supply will be concentrated in and around, call it the core urban sub-markets, majority of our portfolio is in suburban and Boston. We continue to develop a number of suburban communities that are performing quite well. So in that environment, we would expect our portfolio to hold up relatively well given most of that supply is concentrated downtown. In terms of LA and your specific comments about LA. Yes, I mean the supply is, I mean it's heavier in Koreatown, but then Woodland Hills, Warner Center kind of Hollywood and Mid-Wilshire, South Central, there's a little bit actually and then some in Culver City down by the, along the coast as I mentioned. ","So in terms of our portfolio, a little bit of exposure in Hollywood. We don't have anything in South Central or Koreatown. We have two, three assets in Woodland Hills Warner Center. But that sub-market has seen a fair amount of supply over the last decade has done relatively well, most of the assets we have there more affordable price points, which tend to perform quite well in the face of new supply. So in terms of LA, I think we are positioned pretty well given where the supply will be delivered in 2020.","Haendel St. Juste","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Nick Joseph with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","Hi, it's Michael Bilerman. I had a few follow-ups. The first is just back to the retail at The Park Loggia out of that $10 million of forecasted NOI. How much is represented by the 45,000 square feet of leasing. So effectively, how much of the $10 million have you secured?","Matt Birenbaum","Michael, it's Matt, I think it's probably roughly half, maybe a little bit more than half. I can based on well, we had a $1 million in our third quarter numbers release that didn't include one tenant and where it's a little bit early to kind of give guidance in terms of what will end through calendar 2020. But most of it is a lot of that's already in place.","Michael Bilerman","Arguably, I mean that you went through the rent differential between second floor basement and so while you're two-third leased clearly it's lower overall rents relative to the street where you still have the 9,000 that you're marketing. So that's why was just, picture of\u2026","Sean Breslin","Yes, Michael. Correct. I mean the lease rates, as Matt mentioned before are all over the map, depending upon what, but I think the ranges to below $100 a foot well over 400 a foot. If you're on the parts of the ground floor. So it's, I don't think that's what we have pro forma it in for the balance of what's on the first floor some of the better parts of the first already taken, but there is more high value space left to be leased in the building.","Michael Bilerman","All right. And that's what I was trying to the cash flow impact of what's been done and what's to come. So I take it 50% a reasonable number. Then to use, and then part of that is , do you have intentions to originally this to be a JV on the retail or even a sale now that you do and selling at the condos above where is your mindset on selling, or JV-ing the retail portion because arguably would not be core anymore to the company.","Matt Birenbaum","Yes, Mike, I think at some point we would likely sell this, it's really just a question on when we, how to optimize the value and when actually sort of pull the trigger on that. So, and then there is a tax issue. Just in terms of balancing it versus the any profits that we might have in the condo proceeds. And just to given that this is now a taxable transaction, will try to manage it to minimize taxes.","Michael Bilerman","And then as you think about, someone had asked earlier about development funding. As you go into 2020 in terms of the capital that you will need if squared away all of this year and you also have the forward you put in place as well. I guess how should we earmark and arguably capital now sitting in the building upon which you will start selling the condos, are you going to earmark that next year and I guess how should we think about that capital coming back to you able to fund development you intend to hold.","Kevin O'Shea","Sure. So Michael, this is Kevin. You're right, I mean, we do anticipate receiving next year proceeds from the sale condos that will be an important component of call it our equity need for next year's funding activity. There may or may not be additional asset sale disposition activity beyond that and beyond refinancing debt we're likely to look to the debt markets as well. As you know from our leverage profile today in our target leverage, we typically target 5 to 6 turns of leverage for below that now 4.7 turns so, kind of, when we put our budget together for next year. But certainly, I think it's fair to assume that we've got some scope to increase in leverage a little bit given how attractive debt capital markets are today.","Michael Bilerman","And then on the AI initiatives on Slide 8 is Sydney really responding this quickly to people's requests","Sean Breslin","Yes, you've kind of program that what you desire. So it can be instant or it can be as long as you want typically instant isn't good in terms of feeling people get. So it's typically within that about a minute Michael.","Michael Bilerman","Last one is, you made the decision. Earlier this year to stop the quarterly guidance effectively focus people on the long-term because you're in a long-term business I would say that the reactions to the quarterly results. Since then, in the first, second, and now in the third quarter have been more volatile in terms of your stock price performance relative to the index. Now, I know it's hard to separate out the results themselves from things because there's other factors at play. But help us understand, I mean are you going to reconsider it this a one-year trial and I guess how do you think about the short-term volatility that may be created with less information on a quarterly basis versus the long-term.","Tim Naughton","Yes, Michael. Tim here. It's not our expectation that we change our practice at this point, I hear what you're saying there is maybe a little bit more volatility because people's projections may be a little bit more of a just a wider a bigger beta just, around different sell side projections on us. But again, we're trying to focus and we really do manage the business for the longer term. And we really think about more annual plan. It's how we talk at the Board is how we talk among ourselves is as leaders in the company and that's our intent to continue going forward.","Matt Birenbaum","Just to add one thing, Michael, I mean, I understand. We're not providing the quarterly FFO numbers anymore, but to your comment about providing this information. Apart from that we still provide as you can tell from you in this call. Just a robust level of detailed information on the business and every six months. We go through a very detail reforecast which is akin to what we do internally here we management business ourselves and communicating to our Board. So there is still just an awful lot of information that we do try to provide transparency due to investors. What we're not doing is providing the specific earnings number on a quarterly basis but we do think we give more than enough information for investors to drive their own estimates, if they do.","Michael Bilerman","Yes, no, and I would concur with that comment. Your transparency in the time that you spend. I mean we're already at an hour and a half on this earnings call is very much appreciated, and I think differentiates the company over the long term. I was just making a note that since you've changed the quarterly policy, your stock has reacted a lot more volatile relative to the Index unfortunately last two quarters has been much more negative that just to think about whether you're achieving the right output, with the change on the quarterly numbers. That's all.","Tim Naughton","Fair enough. Thank you, Michael.","Michael Bilerman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And there are no other questions. So I would like to turn it back to Tim Naughton for any additional or closing remarks.","Tim Naughton","Well, thanks everybody. As Michael just mentioned, we're about an hour and a half into this call. So we'll give you a quick goodbye and we'll look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT here in just about two or three weeks' time.","Operator","Thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thank everyone for your participation. And you may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Jason Reilley, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley","Thank you, Kyle, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion, and there are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially.

The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during your review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton","Thanks, Jason, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter call. Joining me today are Sean Breslin, EVP of Investments and Asset Management; and Tom Sargeant, our Chief Financial Officer. Sean and I have some prepared remarks, and then the 3 of us will be available for questions.","I'll begin by summarizing our results for the quarter and the underlying fundamentals, and then share some comments on our development activity and financial position. Sean will follow and provide an update on our operating performance, including current trends in the portfolio and offer a brief update on our transaction activity.","Starting with our results for the quarter, last night we reported FFO per share of $1.18. Adjusting for nonroutine items, FFO increased 15.6% over the prior-year period, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of adjusted FFO per share growth of greater than 15%. These results were driven by healthy performance from our stabilized and development portfolios.","Last night, we also adjusted our full year FFO outlook to a range of $5.09 to $5.15 per share. This is well ahead of our original outlook in January and $0.03 less than our interim outlook in July. This reduction is comprised of a number of items, including about $0.02 from the same-store portfolio, $0.02 from the timing of capital market and transactional activity and $0.01 from other community operations, including the Archstone portfolio, offset by $0.02 projected savings in Archstone related acquisition cost.","For the full year, we are now projecting operating FFO per share growth of almost 14% and over 16% when the dilutive impact of the late 2012 equity raise related to the Archstone acquisition is taken into account.","Over the last 14 quarters, since the trough in Q1 of 2010, quarterly operating FFO per share has risen by 68%, driven in part by strong internal growth with cumulative same-store revenue up almost 19% during that time. As we stated over the last couple of years, we believe this cycle is likely shaping up to be more like the '90s rather than the short cycle of the 2000s.","During the '90s cycle, we experienced cumulative effective rent growth of 55% and cumulative FFO per share growth well over 200% for the full cycle, or roughly 3x what we've experienced so far this cycle. As a result, given compelling apartment and housing fundamentals, we believe that we have plenty of runway for growth in the current cycle, particularly as we deliver new product from our growing development pipeline over the next few years at a very attractive cost basis.","Now let's take a minute to drill down on fundamentals, which we believe will continue to support above-trend growth and occupancy. Despite some moderation in recent performance over the last couple of months, we believe the broader housing market is now undersupplied and not that well positioned to meet growing demand coming from an improving private-sector economy, combined with pent-up demand from previously unformed or consolidated households. According to Witten Advisors, Q2 marked the first quarter in which a national housing excess became a housing shortage. This drawdown of excess inventory has occurred despite tepid economic and household growth over the last few years, with estimates that we still have pent-up demand of over 1.2 million households, with 750,000 of those occurring in households 35 years old or younger, our prime renter demographic. And broader demographic patterns will continue to provide a strong tailwind for the sector. We have about 4.5 million individuals turning 20 this year and just under 4 million turning 35, representing a net gain of about 0.5 million in this age cohort just this year before considering any favorable impact from pent-up demand.","The story is equally compelling on the supply side. multifamily permits and starts have leveled off and have begun to decline modestly over the last 12 to 18 months, such that new apartment deliveries should peak nationally in Q1 or Q2 of next year.","In addition, recently starts have began to shift from Coastal to Sunbelt markets and Witten is projecting that 7 of the 8 outperforming markets in the 2013, '16 timeframe will be in AVB's footprint. This leveling off of production is being driven by a combination of rising land and construction prices and capital discipline. In fact, NMHC reports that Q2 marked the first quarter that equity flows into apartments decreased since the recession.","It appears that capital markets continue to pose discipline on the multifamily rental housing market, much like they've done over the course of the modern REIT [ph] area, the last 20 years.","The supply story is even more pronounced in the single-family side, where single-family starts are running around 650,000 units per year or roughly 1\/2 normalized levels. While larger public builders have access to capital, credit to smaller builders remains constrained. Limited investment and entitlements in infrastructure over the last several years has resulted in reduced lot inventory, particularly in attractive infill locations where many first-time homebuyers want to live. With total housing production running at under 1 million units per year currently, it is likely that the broader housing market will continue to perform above long-term trend as long as the economy continues to grow at even just a modest pace of 2% to 2.5%. These housing and apartment market fundamentals give us confidence in the potential of this apartment cycle and provide a strong foundation for us to continue to grow our business.","Speaking of growth, let's turn to our primary growth platform, new development, where we remain very active. During the quarter, we started 4 new communities, including what will be the largest project in the company's history, the dual branded Avalon Willoughby Square\/AVA DoBro Community in Downtown Brooklyn. We also completed 2 new communities this quarter for a total capital cost of about $95 million. These communities were completed ahead of schedule and are projected to produce a weighted average initial stabilized yield of about 7%.","Year-to-date, we've completed over $415 million in new development. Collectively, we project these completions will produce an initial return on cost of about 7.5%, well ahead of prevailing cap rates. Based on our internal projections, these completions would carry a market value of over $600 million, representing spot value creation over cost of around 50%.","We now have $2.7 billion under construction, which is higher than the prior peak on an absolute basis for the company. However, it's just 12% of enterprise value, well below our prior peak of over 20% in late 2007.","Looking ahead to 2014, we are projecting about $1.2 billion in completions. This activity should prove to be an important source of NAV creation and earnings growth over the next few years.","We've also been active replenishing the Development Rights pipeline this year, adding over 20 new Development Rights, representing about 6,500 apartment homes and just under $2 billion in total projected capital cost. About 2\/3 of these opportunities are located in suburban locations and are roughly split between East and West Coast.","Today, the Development Rights pipeline stands at about $3.7 billion, with about 3\/4 located in suburban submarkets, compared to about 1\/2 of those communities under construction. As we stated over the last 1.5 years, we've seen better value in suburban markets of late, particularly given the rigorous entitlement process that often exist in our suburban markets.","The projected economics of the Development Rights pipeline are similar to those under construction, with initial projected yields in the mid to high 6s.","While we've added significantly to our Development Rights pipeline, we've been able to do it in a risk measured way through the use of option contracts. We are currently carrying just $280 million of land for development on the balance sheet, representing under 8% of the pipeline's total projected capital cost. In addition, our own land inventory is largely entitled for its intended use as we pursue final building permits.","Turning now to the right-hand side of the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy excellent financial flexibility, which allows us to finance our investment activity with attractively priced capital. At quarter end, debt to total market caps stood at about 26%, the lowest in the sector. Net debt to projected annualized fourth quarter EBITDA is 5.7x, and interest coverage for the third quarter was 4.3x.","We closed the quarter with over $210 million of cash on the balance sheet and nothing outstanding under our $1.3 billion line of credit. Of our $2.7 billion of active construction, $1.5 billion has been incurred and funded to date, including cash on the balance sheet and dispositions under contract and in marketing, only about $400 million of additional permanent capital is required to complete these communities. Our balance sheet has ample capacity to support our level of development and the flexibility to finance it in a way that optimizes financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sean for his remarks. Sean?","Sean J. Breslin","Thanks, Tim. As Tim mentioned, I will comment on operating performance during the quarter, current portfolio trends and our disposition activity. Starting with operating performance, same-store year-over-year NOI increased 4.2%. Revenues increased just under 4%, driven by a 4.4% increase in rate and a 50-basis point decline in occupancy. Sequentially, total rental revenue increased 1.4%, which was comprised of a 2.2% increase in rates, up 30 basis points from last year and 80 basis points from last quarter and an 80-basis point decline in occupancy from 96.6% to 95.8%.","Through 3 quarters of 2013, we've increased rental revenue 4.7% and expenses were up just 2.9%, generating an NOI increase of 5.5%. As I indicated during last quarter's call, we took advantage of the strong occupancy platform we built during the second quarter and pushed hard on renewals during the third quarter, which is when the greatest percentage of our leases expire. We achieved average renewal increases of 6.1% during the quarter, 100 basis points above the prior year period and total rent change of 4.6%, about 70 basis points above last year. We did, however, experience greater turnover during the quarter, which increased 5% on a year-over-year basis to 70%. The increased turnover was partly due to more aggressive rent increases as move outs due to rent increase were up 200 basis points sequentially to 17%, but also resulted from a roughly 15% increase in unplanned move-outs due to lease breaks, which is generally either people buying a home, which increased about 100 basis points year-over-year to 16%, or relocating for a new job.","While we gave up 50 basis points of occupancy relative to the same quarter last year, we expected occupancy to fall given our aggressive renewal increases. On a year-to-date basis, average occupancy is still 20 basis points above last year, and we believe the rent roll is better positioned as we move forward to 2014.","Switching to the Archstone portfolio. Well, we have had some noise in our operating expense trends over the past couple of quarters. The full year NOI from the portfolio is basically in line with our original underwriting, even though it is performing slightly below our midyear forecast. The stabilized Archstone assets produced sequential rental revenue growth of about 1% and occupancy for the quarter was 95.1%.","Regionally, the Pacific Northwest and Northern California continue to outperform the remainder of the portfolio. The Pacific Northwest has produced rental revenue gains of 6.4% on a year-over-year basis and nearly 8% year-to-date. Although job growth is beginning to slow from the tore [ph] base we experienced the past couple of years, the Seattle area continues to produce well above national average job growth and steady demand for apartments. Google is planning to hire 1,000 associates at its local campus over the next few years, and Amazon is investing in enough office space to double the size of its workforce in the area. These high wage Internet and software publishing employment gains should continue to benefit the local economy and produce healthy apartment demand as new supply continues to come on line.","In Northern California, tech and construction-related employment growth remains robust. Year to date, rental revenue is up nearly 8.5% in the region. The tech sector continues to grow in the region's top -- Jones Lang LaSalle's outlook of the top, U.S. tech centered office markets for the next 12 months. The East Bay is leading the Northern California region in terms of revenue performance, delivering 9% revenue growth and almost 10% rate growth during the third quarter. San Francisco continues to produce north of 8% revenue growth on a year-over-year basis and is supported by a steady job growth and the fact that supply is relatively limited until the beginning of 2014. San Jose produced north of 1% job growth over the past 6 months and greater than 6% year-over-year revenue growth during the third quarter. The growth is starting to moderate in certain pockets of the Metro area as supply continues to come on line.","Moving down the coast to Southern California. Year-to-date rental revenues was up 4.2%. The regions of employment gains have broadened [ph] in the financial services and tech industries. However, the content for our mobile devices is produced in the Southern California region and many of the more active tech firms in Northern California are investing in the Silicon Beach tech district of Los Angeles. Orange County has produced the best job growth in the region over the past 6 months and is leading the region with 4.6% revenue growth on a year-to-date basis as compared to 4.3% in San Diego and 3.9% in Los Angeles.","Shifting to the East Coast. New England and the Metro New York, New Jersey area produced year-to-date rental revenue increases of 3.2% and 4.7% respectively. In Boston, construction in health and education services employment gains are running well above trend. Our primarily suburban portfolio in Boston is benefiting from steady job growth and limited supply. Rent changed to average almost 7% for the quarter, reflecting 5.25% for move ins and almost 8% for renewals. While we gave up 60 basis points of occupancy in Boston as compared to the second quarter, we were quite pleased with the rent growth we realized during the quarter.","In the New York, New Jersey Metro area, hiring in professional and business services continues to support healthy demand, while Wall Street layoffs has slowed. Our New York City portfolio has produced north of 6% revenue growth on a year-to-date basis, about 200 basis points above what we have achieved in Westchester County and on Long Island. We expect revenue growth in the city to moderate a bit as more supply comes on line over the next few quarters.","To date, we have experienced some softening in Long Island City given the recent deliveries, but other pockets of supply have had minimal impact on our same-store portfolio.","And lastly, revenue growth from our D.C. Metro portfolio was up about 1% year-to-date but turned flat on a year-over-year basis.","Sequestration in the volume of new supply were already creating a headwind in the market, so the threat of the government shutdown and debt ceiling debate didn't help our third quarter results. Rent change in the region was 1% for the quarter and reflected renewal rate growth of 3.8% and new move ins down 2%. We expect the D.C. market to continue to be challenged for the next few quarters given the uncertainty in the mind of both direct and indirect government workers and the continued impact of new supply.","Turning to expenses. Same-store expenses were up 2.9% year-to-date, about 3\/4 of this growth is coming from property taxes and insurance-related expenses. We're feeling the most pressure on taxes in the Metro New York, New Jersey and New England regions.","Looking forward, October's committed renewals were 5.25%, 25 basis points above last year. Renewal offers for November and December are in the mid to high 5s, about 75 basis points ahead of last year and current occupancy for the same-store portfolio is in the high 95s.","Turning last to our transaction activity. On paper, the third quarter was quiet, however, several transactions were in process that required approval from the local jurisdiction, which can be a lengthy process. We did complete the disposition of Archstone in Vanoni Ranch located in Ventura, California for $82 million last week. The estimated cap rate on this disposition was about 5%.","In addition, we have another $350 million under contract without risk deposits scheduled to close before Thanksgiving.","We also have 2 deals in the marketing process, which represents about $200 million that we'll likely close in late December or early next year. Dispositions continue to represent an attractive source of capital to fuel development and redevelopment.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Tim for some closing remarks, Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton","Thanks, Sean. So in summary, 2013 is shaping up to be another great year for the company. Apartment markets continue to support strong internal growth, and the portfolio is well positioned headed into the winter leasing season. In addition, we believe fundamentals are likely to remain healthy over the next few years, which bodes well for 2014 and beyond, as we deliver an increasing number of development communities into the market. This level of development is supported by strong liquidity and a balance sheet position to fund this activity in a cost effective manner, helping to facilitate earnings and NAV growth over the next few years from this important growth platform.","And with that, operator, we are now prepared to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Derek Bower from ISI group.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Did I miss it or did you provide what the new same-store guidance is for '14 with the $0.02 reduction at the core?","Timothy J. Naughton","Derek, well, I think it's in our 2013. We did mention it, but the $0.02 reduction in same-store outlook will essentially bring you towards the lower end of the range of 5 to 5.75 for same-store NOI for the full year 2013.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And where do you plan to end occupancy for the year? Should we just assume it remains flat?","Sean J. Breslin","Derek, this is Sean Breslin. In terms of occupancy, in terms of where we're running right now, as I mentioned, we're in the high 95s. So on a current basis, we're basically trending about where we trended during the third quarter. In terms of November and December, we haven't provided specific guidance on that, but to give you some sense of where we're trending right now.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit more about Seattle and how it's doing in the CBD versus east side and which region maybe contributing to more of the occupancy loss there? And are there any -- is there any impact from sort of short-term leases from contract workers that we should think about in that market during the second half of the year?","Timothy J. Naughton","Sure, Derek, happy to. In terms of the different submarkets within Seattle, I mean, our portfolio is basically Bellevue, Redmond, a little bit in the North End and then really very, very little in same-store, Downtown. So if you look at the distribution, it's 1 asset for us, Downtown, which has performed well on a year-over-year basis, but sequentially was the softest of the submarkets within Seattle. So it's a sample of one, so keep that in mind, but that's what we're seeing there. And then we also saw more softening in the Redmond during the third quarter. If you look at it sequentially, we are hearing some feedback really just anecdotal for the most part, in terms of some of the contract workers for Microsoft, some of those projects either being paused or delayed for certain reasons that we can't put a specific finger on, but obviously, you've got a CEO transition going on in Microsoft, and I'm sure they are reevaluating certain strategic priorities they are considering. And as I understand based on what we know, there's been some contract workers that have left the area. So it did have an impact on Redmond. Bellevue has been pretty healthy, and then on the North End, it's actually been relatively healthy for us. There was some noise around Boeing in terms of layoffs and things like that. But if you look at it on a sequential basis, the North End was fine in the third quarter and held up better than Redmond did during the third quarter. Hopefully, that helps.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just lastly, do you think 150 new jobs per month is enough to see that acceleration in 2014 if that's what we average over the next, call it, 12 months or so?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes. 150,000 jobs a month, Derek, this is Tim, I think that would be consistent, probably the lower end of that range of 2%, 2.5% GDP growth. But yes, it's our sense somewhere in the 150,000 to 200,000 jobs per month would support the kind of supply that we're seeing both in the multifamily side of the market, as well as the single-family side. It's not still result [ph] in a growing shortage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just had 1 or 2 questions on development in the quarter, and I know you touched on this a little bit in the prepared remarks, but is there anything to read in the rights sort of contracting on a sequential basis? Is there a signal that you guys aren't feeling the pressure to sort of refill the pipeline as much at this point in the cycle or is it just really kind of a sequential blip?","Timothy J. Naughton","David, this is Tim. Yes, probably a little bit of both. I mean, obviously, you had $600 million moved from the Development Rights pipeline into development community basket, driven largely by the Willoughby deal in Brooklyn. But -- and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we brought on $2 billion in new Development Rights this year, $700 million or so of those were from Archstone and about $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion, were sort of AVB legacy deals. But to your second point, based upon our view of the markets, I guess I'd be surprised if we kind of continued that kind of run rate and replenishing the pipeline next year, just based upon the opportunity set and kind of where we would likely be in the cycle by at time we actually took those deals through the entitlement process and actually got them built and stabilized. So I guess I would say we're not feeling quite the same sense of urgency to maybe fill the pipeline as we have certainly in 2010 -- 2011 to mid-2013 period.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then on the aggregate yield at about 6.4%, that's down 40 or 50 basis points from a year ago. Where do you expect that going to trough in terms of kind of the compression in yields? Is it really just dependent on the capital environment or is it more related to your rent forecast for the aggregate pipeline?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, in terms of the projected yield, assuming relatively a decent economy, I think we're around there today. A lot of it is being driven by the Willoughby deal, the Brooklyn deal, which was a legacy deal plus New York assets tend to be on the lower end of the yield spectrum, I mean to give you a sense, that would be a high 5s kind of yield. So it's being driven as much by the introduction of Willoughby into the pipeline as anything else. In fact, the drop from 6.6% to 6.4% this past quarter is almost entirely due to the combination of Willoughby and Hayes Valley, which is a phenomenally located community in Downtown San Francisco, which are both in the high 5s to 6 range in terms of development yields.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then my last question just has to be with expenses, again, I apologize if I missed it. The notable decline in Northern California related to tax reversal, I believe. Did you touch on that -- details on that particular expense decline? And is it possible for you guys to state what your aggregate expense growth would have been minus that?","Sean J. Breslin","David, this is Sean. I can touch on the specific issue that came up during the quarter, which is a property tax refund that we received as a result of an appeal on a Mission Bay asset in San Francisco. Just in round numbers to give you a sense, you can run the math, it was about $1.2 million [ph] number that flow through. So that should give you some sense of what it did to overall expense growth during the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just want to follow up, my first question, just want to follow up on David Toti's question on your development program. Just given where with the stocks trading off the way they have and obviously it increases the cost of your capital and development yields coming down as construction cost goes up and interest rates go up, do you see yourself ramping up the disposition activity to fund more of the capital side with the disposition? I mean, it sounds like you guys are actively dialing back on future external investment, but just sort of curious as you look to funding that, should we anticipate you guys selling more?","Timothy J. Naughton","Alex, this is Tim and certainly Tom can jump in. I did, Tom, in our financial flexibility and one of the reasons we want to have flexibility is to be able to avail ourselves of whatever capital product makes the most sense in a particular time. When you're trading at -- if you're trading at applied cap rate or discount NAV, obviously, it's going to make a little bit make sense on a net -- at the margins to be a net seller of assets rather than a net buyer. But as it relates to 2014, I suspect our capital raises will be from a variety of different sources, whether that be net dispositions, debt or equity.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then the next question is, just on turnover, maybe I missed in your opening comments, but on your July call, you guys were pretty bullish and said things were pretty good. Turnover is up 500 points versus what it was 1 year ago in the third quarter. So just more color on sort of what's going on with turnover. Is that the result of maybe it's the Archstone properties, their higher end maybe, that's what drove the increase in turnover or maybe this was regional, was it Seattle, just sort of more color on that. And also, just where you expected to go. Do you expect it to stay elevated or do you think it's going to come down?","Sean J. Breslin","This is Sean. As it relates to turnover, a few comments. First, it obviously did run up in the third quarter as compared to the first 2 quarters. We pushed the hardest during the third quarter in terms of rental rate increases. So we were expecting turnover to come up some, it probably came up a little more than we thought. The one piece that we had not anticipated is that of the 500 basis point increase in turnover, about 40% of that was what we call unplanned move outs or in common terms, lease breaks. And so, you can sort of project what you think that's going to be based on history, but that activity was up more than we expected. And generally, what that ties back to is either home purchases or job relocations is where you see it show up in those different categories. So you sort of have a trend that you expect that was unexpected, so that's one piece of it. In terms of the reasons, like home purchase, rent increase, et cetera, it's actually pretty steady. If you looked at that on a year-over-year basis, there wasn't a lot of change. On a sequential basis, as I mentioned, rent increases did move up by about 200 basis points, which was not necessarily too surprising given how hard we were pushing on the gas in terms of renewals. And then as it relates to maybe the regional distribution, I think you mentioned, we did see the greatest year-over-year change in the Pacific Northwest, which was up about 14%. And then Northern California and Southern California were up 7% and 6%, respectively. And the market that were more moderate, new England was up about 3%, mid-Atlantic was about flat. So that's sort of the distribution of it. But I think there was just more activity overall than what we expected and the reasons didn't change dramatically on a year-over-year basis when you really look at it. Home purchases were up a little bit but not dramatically.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","But do you anticipate these trends -- I mean, it sounds like these trends will continue?","Sean J. Breslin","I mean come over time, certainly turnover is going to move back to longer-term averages. You would expect how long it takes to get there is something that we don't know, you would expect it to be more correlated with overall improvement and economic activity though to free up job relocations, more home purchase activity, things of that sort, as new homes get built. The piece that's a little less predictable, to be honest, is the unplanned piece, which is as I mentioned, is about 40% of that 500 basis points. So our expectations for the year were that turnover would be up about 200 basis points relative to last year's 53%. We're probably not going to be that far off when you smooth it out in the fourth quarter, which is typically the lower volume quarter to begin with.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS.","Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research","It's Nick Yulico here. I just wanted to follow-up on that turnover issue. You said as far as the increases from the lease breaks, job relocations or home buying, did you say that that actually -- the biggest impact from those was in the Pacific Northwest and California?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, what I was quoting was the year-over-year change in turnover for each one of the regions. And in the Pacific Northwest, turnover was up 14% and then Northern and Southern California were 7% and 6%. That's the year-over-year change. In terms of the lease breaks that I mentioned, that was a portfolio-wide quote, that of the 500-basis-point increase from 65% to 70%, 40% of that resulted from an increase in lease break activity that's somewhat volatile and hard to forecast. We sort of have a baseline of what we think that's going to be in terms of how we manage revenue based on historical trends. It just happened to be up in the third quarter.","Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research","Okay. So it sounds like the lease break issue was -- you're saying was a national issue, right?","Sean J. Breslin","Overall, yes. It does vary by market, which I don't have in front of me right at the moment. But generally, lease breaks are about 20% to 30% of our total turnover activity. It just happened to spike during the third quarter. So we're taking a look at that in terms of what that might be related to. Some of the things that you would hope it might be related to in terms of economic activity, job relocations and things like that, did move up a little bit. We just haven't correlated all those back to unplanned move outs yet.","Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research","Okay. And Ross has a question.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple here. On your new lease rent growth, was that somewhere around 3% during the quarter?","Sean J. Breslin","For move ins, for the whole portfolio?","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Well you said it was 6.1% in the renewals and I think you said the total rent changed.","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, move ins. Yes, so it's around 3% for new move ins, 6.1% in renewals, correct, blended in to mid-4s.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So I guess it's fair to say that the occupancy number came in a little below perhaps what you were thinking because of the turnover. I guess, were those unplanned lease breaks, do you think those were going to happen anyway or do you think you pushed too hard on the rent growth?","Sean J. Breslin","Price depends by market. I'd say, Ross, probably the market were -- you're always kind of testing. In the second quarter, if you think like, we were at 96.6% for the quarter in terms of economic occupancy. And to be honest, those were probably a little bit higher than we would have liked, and we would have pushed a little bit harder if we had known that we were heading towards 96.6%. And so, as we start to pushing hard later in the second quarter going into the third quarter, my anticipation is, yes, when you look at the move outs due to rent increase or financial reasons, and sometimes it's hard to parse what was really a rent increase versus someone lost a job and it's the financial reason. But there are couple of markets where that category went up more than others, and therefore, you could correlate our push on rents to the increased turnover. So for example, in Seattle, the percentage of our move outs that related to rent increase went up and turnover went up most significantly in that market. So we do believe there is a correlation there that we pushed pretty hard in Seattle, maybe a little bit harder than we should have at that point in the cycle. But overall, on net basis, we still had positive rent change through the quarter in that market. So I think Tom wants to make a comment as well. Tom, you want to add something?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Ross, something -- an unplanned lease break wouldn't be caused by us pushing too hard on rents because it's by definition, it's unplanned. So just keep that in mind as you're thinking about that question.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Was it the same trend inside of Archstone, do you think?","Sean J. Breslin","Across all the baskets, turnover was up, and it did vary. So they weren't all 500 basis points, so it did move around. But, yes, Archstone was also up.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then the last question for me. You had mentioned capital flows easing a bit and as I think about that, we've seen the same kind of numbers in the third quarter from the RCA statistics. If capital flows are starting to back off in terms of transaction activity, what do you think that means in terms of the direction of cap rates as we look ahead over the next 12 months, particularly when you factor in the easing that we've had in NOI growth across the sector?","Sean J. Breslin","This is Sean. I'll mention a couple of things, then Tim can comment if he like. But in terms of transaction volume, which you see in RCA, obviously transaction volume, if you look at the U.S. overall, actually is up about 17% through 3 quarters relative to last year. Our up markets is actually down a little bit when you look at it. But there has been a number of portfolio trades this year that's made up some of that activity. So on a one-off basis, if you exclude the portfolio, trades activity is down across the U.S. about 10%. Part of that is just a function of what's available for sale and prior to the end of 2012, there's a fair bit of activity from people that were concerned about tax law changes. So I know from a lot of discussions we have with major owners, there was price -- some of that activity is pulled forward into '12 and you're seeing some of the softening as a result in the volume in '13. And as it relates -- so that's sort of the volume picture, in terms of cap rates, certainly, you would expect to the extent that we're seeing fundamentals slow as we move forward in terms of NOI growth, the people are dialing in the same returns, at comparable cost of capital, you would expect cap rates to come up a little bit. I think that question for everybody is, what is going to happen with cost of capital and total returns as a result of that, since those 2 are intertwined. And obviously, we started to run up in the 10 year, but it's starting to ease back off. The pricing we're seeing in the transaction market is holding up pretty well. I mean, there was a little bit of softening in certain markets as you might expect. But we've not seen a dramatic run-up in cap rates at this point. And Tim can comment on the future, if he likes.","Timothy J. Naughton","Ross, I was just going to add, I read my comment in my prepared remarks was really much directed about new start activity, just equity flows starting to abate as it relates to new development. But it certainly can be extrapolated to the entire space, and it's all related, right, in terms of -- if there's lots of development activity, that's likely to support asset values to the extent there's less equity flows to support transactions that might suppress them a little bit as well. So I think you have to look at it fairly holistically.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Jana for Jeff. Tim, maybe following up on this comments, I think previously you've mentioned your portfolio would experience peak deliveries in mid-2014. Is that kind of still the anticipated timeframe? Or do you think that due to some delays you could see additional supply coming on line in bulk to your portfolio in '15 as well?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, Jana, this is Tim. I think you're asking about portfolio, but did you mean markets or our markets or our portfolio, specifically?","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The markets to your portfolio, specifically.","Timothy J. Naughton","No. We still anticipate that the peak level will, in terms of deliveries, will be in 2014 in our markets. Originally, we thought it might have been as early as late 2013, but there were some starts that got pushed back later to 2013 than we had originally had anticipated, such that the peak volume started to really crest more in Q1, Q2 of 2014. And I think we'll start to see that same trend for national markets as well. I think some of it stands to reason, our market -- sometimes the permitting process just takes longer than anything it's going to take. Whereas obviously in some of the Sunbelt markets, you can get into the ground a little bit quicker, and therefore sometimes accelerated start.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then maybe on D.C. specifically where we've already seen some negative new lease rate growth, but the bulk of supply will really come on line kind of early '14. I was curious, if you're thinking of managing that market any differently in terms of revenue management or maybe trying to sign renewals much earlier than kind of that 3 months out?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Jana, this is Sean. As it relates to the D.C. Metro, yes, we do try to optimize revenue growth for each of the markets independently, and it's done at the asset level and even done at the unit level. And so, there's not a blanket statement for -- that applies to every asset, but just in terms of general tactics for the mid-Atlantic, some of the things you mentioned, yes, trying to get lease renewals earlier. So for example, when we were back in August and September, we were approaching people that had November and December lease expirations, trying to get them to renew early, looking more closely with the lease expiration matrix and adjusting that a little bit in terms of the natural bell curve that we have to try and shift some stuff out. So there are number of different things that we do in terms of trying to manage our risk in a market as it starts to soften, but it really is done at the submarket and the asset level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just want to go back to the same-store commentary, tracking towards the lower end of the range for same-store NOI growth. If we just apply the simple math, the same-store revenues that sort of suggest maybe a 3% growth in the fourth quarter, is that how we should be thinking about the fourth quarter? And then given that supply, I think you expect that to peak in the first to second quarter of '14, just wondering what that same-store revenue growth could get to, does it get to flat or is something better than that when the peak supply ends?","Timothy J. Naughton","This is Tim. Obviously, we haven't given any guidance or outlook for 2014 yet, so we can't really comment on that. But in terms of the math as it relates to Q4, I said towards the lower end of the range, I don't think I've said the actual -- I don't think I said the low-end of the range, but towards the low end of the range.","Sean J. Breslin","Yes. I think Tim quoted the lower end of the NOI growth range that we provided in our midyear outlook, is that what you're referring to?","Yes, I think Tim's comment was that we'd be at the lower end of the NOI range. We didn't specifically get into the revenue or OpEx targets other than that we're within the guidance that we gave mid-year.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just to clarify on the -- I think I heard in terms of the FFO as adjusted, I think a $0.02 impact from same-store, $0.02 from timing, $0.02 from some other stuff and then offset by $0.02 of savings. So should we think about the midpoint of 6.30 [ph] was the old midpoint and now that should be more like 6.26 [ph] I guess? Is that the right way to think about it?","Timothy J. Naughton","6.25[ph] , Vincent.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","6.25[ph] .","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, 6.25[ph] .","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just the last question, just in terms of D.C., flat revenue growth there for the quarter. Was the Archstone portfolio, was that a similar trend or can you comment on that?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure. Be happy to, Vincent. This is Sean. In terms of the Archstone portfolio relative to the AvalonBay same-store portfolio, the AvalonBay same-store portfolio actually outperformed the Archstone portfolio on a sequential basis. And really, it's was a function of the distribution of the assets. So for example, there's some larger high-rise assets here in the RBC corridor of D.C. Metro and those tended to underperform in the past quarter when you look at it sequentially, which led to the Archstone basket underperforming the AvalonBay basket during the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from BMO Capital.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So you talked about a slowing the process of replenishing the development pipeline. What would you say the percentage of development will be of assets, if it's 11% today, what will that number be 2 years from now?","Timothy J. Naughton","Rich, this is Tim. I don't know. I don't know where our equity price will be.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","If you [indiscernible] everything else flat?","Timothy J. Naughton","I would hesitate to give you a percentage, but I would expect it to be less. I would expect this year, next year likely to be sort of the peak levels for us. In part, it's because of the Archstone transaction as well. Remember, we did inherit about $1 billion of new development from Archstone. $300 million are under construction, about $700 million in development, right? So it's driven as much by that, and then in combination with kind of my earlier remarks, in terms of -- just in terms of sort of the relative attractiveness at this point in the cycle versus 2, 3 years ago. The way I've described it internally, if we have to dial it at 9 or 10 in terms of new development opportunities in 2010, '11, maybe it's more like 7 or 8 over the last couple of years and maybe it's dialed back down to 5 or 6 given where we are in the cycle today. So we're are still active, still chasing deals. But looking for -- still looking for value, which is a bit more challenging just given where land price and construction costs have gone.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Next question is -- I know the last question you fought it off, not giving 2014 guidance, but I do want to ask. At the beginning of the call, you mentioned that this cycle's behaving more like the cycles of the '90s than other -- than the more recent. And speaking to the longevity of the cycle or longer duration of the up cycle, using those words or that paraphrase, what does that mean? Does that mean positive growth but decelerating throughout the process? Or do you think of the picture over the next couple of years, that same-store kind of behaving in a similar way in terms of mid-single-digit type growth? I'm not talking about next year, I'm just talking generally over the course of the cycle.","Timothy J. Naughton","Couple of things, Rich. We have said, we do expect it to be above trend for the next 2, 3 years, just based upon fundamentals as we see it today. But I think we talked about this last quarter as well. If you look back to the '90s versus the 2000s, the 2000s was accelerating until it stopped and then it decelerated. And the '90s were very different, where you had supply being relatively constant, which is what we're seeing today, we've seen it over the last 12 or 18 months, but the job growth maybe stronger one year, a little bit weaker the next year but still in a positive growth economy. We saw same-store performance move up and down by 100 to 200 basis points from one year to the next, and that's -- so when we talk about this being more like the '90s that's what we're talking about. We don't see it being just a straight up acceleration followed by deceleration over a course of 4 years, which is what the 2000 cycle gave us.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Understood. Question for Tom. If we factor in the recent disposition, $82 million, and then what's on the docket, the $350 million, where does that get us in terms of secured debt percentage at the end of the year?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Let me speak to it in terms of unencumbered NOI. I think we're going to still be in the high 60s range.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","High 60s by the end of the year?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Yes, we're in high 60s now. It's not going to move that much.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Another quick question here, some chatter about condominium conversion starting to make waves again. Are you seeing that as a being a factor at all in your disposition outreach? How? And if so, do you think that we could actually see cap rates kind of plateau or even go back down if and when the condo conversion element of the disposition story takes shape?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Rich, this is Sean. As it relates to condo conversion activity, we've not had bidders show up for our assets that are condo converters just yet. If you looked at a window of time and said when would be right for that to occur, it probably is in the near future, when you look at the level of housing production overall, as Tim was talking about relative to historical trends, and the fact that multifamily construction is well ahead of the single-family end of the condo purpose built segments. We've heard about a couple of small deals that I have heard in D.C. where they've done condo conversions. And I think part of it is, there's obviously increasing demand for housing overall, including condominiums, and one thing that probably needs to heal a little bit more is just the financing in the condominium market. Single-family market has been difficult but is easing in terms of being able to secure home financing. Condominium financing for retail buyers is still relatively challenged. And there's a pretty high hurdle to not only get the individual customer approved, but to get the building approved. So that probably needs to soften up a little bit more to see that activity, but we would not be surprised to see some of the deals that were converted to rental, converted back to apartments sometime over the next year or 2. We've seen some of that, but not a lot. And then, Tim can add if you like.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, Rich, I just have one thing to add, I think just broadly, just housing prices and values just aren't there yet to support a lot of activity. You just think about where affordability is versus where it was in 2005 and '06, that's what drove a lot of the conversions. You just go back over the last 15 years and you look at the trend in apartment values versus the trend in housing prices, it's just not going to support much condo conversion activity at this point with the exception of a few markets, maybe Manhattan, South Florida, San Francisco.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And at what point does it start to make sense to buy back stock with disposition proceeds? I mean, do you need to be at 10% discount or are you just not there yet? What are your thoughts on buyback?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Rich, we don't talk about buybacks, so we decline to talk about buybacks.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then just last question, can you give any color on turnover and breaks? Was it similar across the different product types, the different brands and what have you or were there any differences?","Sean J. Breslin","Rich, this is Sean. I don't have the turnover data by product type in front of me to be able to give you that information, but I'm sure we can get it separately and get it to you.","Thomas J. Sargeant","Rich, let me respond to your question about buybacks. It's a capital allocation decision. And right now, development is a compelling use of capital, and that's where we feel like we should be allocating our capital. We always look at stock buybacks, or we'll look at debt buybacks, or we'll look at acquisitions of new existing assets. But right now, where it stands, the compelling use of our capital today is for development.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just sticking with the stock buyback for one second. Have you had any conversations with the Lehman Estate board? Have they approached or you approached them on their position?","Thomas J. Sargeant","We have not had any conversations and we have not been approached and they haven't approached us.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then you mentioned the Brookyln project being the largest in the company's history. What are you doing to mitigate risk and ensure that high 5% return and what are you assuming for current rents?","Timothy J. Naughton","Nick, this is Tim. I don't know exactly what we have assumed for rents. But the biggest thing we're doing from a risk mitigation standpoint is match funding. We raised about coincidentally between the bond deal and free cash flow and net dispo proceeds, we raised about what we started this past quarter. So it's one of the reasons why we have as much liquidity, as much cash on our balance sheet as we have right now. It's a reflection of just the -- more making commitments. We're taking more of that risk off the table and taking less capital markets risk with respect to big investments like Willoughby. We can certainly get to the -- I think the rents are -- the average rent is actually in the press release and we get you the average square footage for sure.","Sean J. Breslin","This is Sean, just to add on to that, one thing to keep in mind is to how we underwrite rents. We do underwrite rents in place to the extent that the building was constructed sitting there at the time that we start construction. So some companies trend rents based on expected rent growth over a couple of year construction period. We don't do that. So we do expect rent levels would climb over that period of time that we're under construction. But we certainly don't underwrite that component of it.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And Tim, it's Michael Bilerman. Are you doing anything from a construction mitigation perspective and how confident are you in sort of the construction cost? Are you recognizing -- raising capitals an important risk mitigation mechanism, but just managing a large construction budget of that size, and what is it, 57, 58 for a tower. Maybe just talk a little bit about the project overall in that scope?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes. Well, it's not our first high-rise or development deal in New York, down in Manhattan, down in Long Island City, been involved and then others in Brooklyn. So we have a lot of the same styles who work with at Fort Greene. And Michael, buy it all out of front, so cost committed. Costs have come back a bit, so these are contractors that are making money again. So we're not talking about guys that are doing business underneath cost, which you had a little bit going on in 2009 and 2010. So I think in some ways, the risk is less perhaps than what we've seen. But maybe you could have seen a couple of years ago, as costs started to rise and you started to see some subs [ph] start to walk from jobs. We haven't seen that. I haven't seen that in New York. I really haven't had that experience. And I just point back to the billions that we've built over the last 10 years. Our cost record has been excellent. In general, it was in about plus or minus 1% of projected capital budget.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And how much like sort of retail or other uses that are outside of just pure multifamily and sort of the -- in the budget?","Timothy J. Naughton","In that case, very little. The land seller actually has a right to buy back whatever retail is there. So I mean it is almost exclusively residential in terms of the exposure to the rent roll.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Unknown Analyst","Tim, you opened your remarks reiterating your view that we're early in a long-term rent growth cycle. How do you think about the investment proposition for rental housing in an environment where long-term rates are rising? Specifically thinking about the interplay between the growth in demand versus kind of the change in cap rates.","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, it's an issue that any financial asset has, right. It's not just confined to rental housing. To answer that, you'd have to answer that question with respect all real estate and financial assets. I do think we have a bit of a buffer as it relates to fundamentals. As rates move up, you would expect homeownership rates to be a bit constrained as affordability becomes a little bit tougher from a homeownership perspective. So my comments, to be clear, were really about the operating fundamentals and not the capital market fundamentals. When you get to actual valuation, it's always going to be a function of both and not just rising capital cost, but what's the source of rising capital cost, is it real rates or is it nominal real rates. I think the recent backup we saw in repricing was really a reflection of real rate movement as opposed to nominal movement, which obviously real estate provides a bit of a hedge from that as well. So I think if -- you really have to sort of take into account all those things, operating fundamentals, the source of inflation in terms of the impact ultimately of capital cost on valuation.","Unknown Analyst","Do you think that maybe you have sort of new ground, if you will, in terms of sensitivity to the changes in interest rates and in terms -- maybe because purchase housing is or homeownership is going to maybe be a little more challenging in the future, it's going to affect the relationship you have now with demand for rental housing, but also I guess I'd say the appeal of investing in rental housing might not be quite -- I guess it will just -- diverge from where it was in the past?","Timothy J. Naughton","As a result of rising interest rates? I'm sorry, I missed the -- I think I...","Unknown Analyst","I'm wondering if the appeal of rental housing -- just because it's more challenging to buy a home than it has been in the past periods even though interest rates might be rising might effectively make rental housing in your eyes more appealing as an investment because it's going to be somewhat more insensitive, if you will, to rising rates?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, perhaps. I think homeownership price probably, as much as anything, is driven by the ability to generate a down payment. When you look historically at homeownership rate patterns -- I mean, our view on the future is that we're going to have much more balanced housing demand, much like we did from the early 70s to the mid-90s. It was really only in the 2000s where you had this distortion of first for-sale housing and then rental housing and we're back sort of in that norm level of around 65% -- 65% homeownership rate. And so that's frankly, that's our expectation going forward, that we'll continue to have more balanced rental -- more balanced housing demand between rental and for sale.","Unknown Analyst","And could you talk a little bit what's been happening in land prices, maybe where you see them heading just given that on one hand robust construction activity that's been driving pricing, but potentially softening capital flows into the sector?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, as I mentioned in my remarks, our focus on suburban as of late was in part to the kind of run up we saw in land pricing on urban deals, particularly deals that were entitled -- a lot of the urban deals that have been purchased and have been started were already entitled. And those traded -- and somewhat traded a little bit more commodity like in terms of from a valuation perspective, so as demand move, pricing move pretty quickly in response. But I suspect land cost pressures will start to abate somewhat if capital costs move up and required returns follow and I think that's probably a little bit why you've seen equity pull back a little bit as of late.","Unknown Analyst","And just one last question. On your current development rights, I think you have about $3.7 billion of cost. What portion of that pipeline is, I guess I would say, in the money, if you will, where near-term construction starts would economically make sense, irrespective of whether or not you're actually starting versus projects that maybe you're a few years from penciling out?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, we look at everything on current economic basis. So if you could start it today, they'd all pencil out in a sense. And I have said that time will take 2 or 3 years to get through the entitlement process and you are -- it's one of the reasons why we're going to use option contracts, you're making somewhat of a bet that rental fundamentals will not be too disconnected from construction market fundamentals, right. Your land costs are fixed, so you've got your bid hedge with respect to the capital cost, but ultimately, if -- you are betting that they don't become too unhinged [ph] with one another. And if they do, that's why you option the land. Potentially, you have an opportunity to renegotiate or to walk away if it doesn't make economic sense.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson from Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Just one last question guys. The 1.63 you guys did normalize in the third quarter, your guidance for the fourth quarter is 1.54 to 1.60. Is there any nonrecurring or other abnormal items in the fourth quarter guidance? Or is it just basically dispositions in a weaker sequential operating result that's pulling the sequential FFO down?","Timothy J. Naughton","I think the operating FFO, which would exclude the nonroutine is about -- was actually at 1.64 to get to the 6.25 for the full year.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. So but I mean...","Timothy J. Naughton","Which includes the adjustments for the nonroutine items that you're asking, and any nonroutine items that you're asking about.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay, so there's somewhere between $0.05 and $0.12 of nonroutine items in the quarter?","Timothy J. Naughton","I'd have to take a look at it, I don't have it in front of me, Rob.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Is all the nonroutine for the fourth quarter Archstone stuff? Or is it debt repayment? I mean, what's the nonroutine in the fourth quarter?","Thomas J. Sargeant","It's primarily Archstone, Rob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach from Goldman Sachs.","Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just on the 6.4% development pipeline yield, have you marked a high-line in the current length rent yet? It's a big -- obviously it's 10% of your pipeline so you can move the number?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, great question, Andrew. We haven't marked any deals that have not yet started leasing to market where we don't have at least about 20% of the leases in place. So the answer is no, we haven't marked that to market.","Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And that's a hot market, so I'm presuming the bias would be up in that yield?","Timothy J. Naughton","Correct.","Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just one another one. I'm following-up on multiple cap rate questions. Obviously, you guys are doing a lot in the fourth quarter. What's the range of cap rates that you're closing on in the deals that you're doing?","Sean J. Breslin","Andrew, this is Sean. It really depends on the market. I'll give you some general observations based on what we're seeing, which is the West Coast cap rates are still pretty aggressive. I'd describe it anywhere from low 4s to low 5s, depending on core urban versus second-tier suburban locations. And then as you move to the East Coast, it probably is in the, I'd say, 4.75 to 5.75 for most markets, but that would exclude New York, which is substantially below that as you might know. And then even here in the core of D.C. and the urban markets, we're hearing some stuff that's maybe in the mid-4s. But hopefully that gives you a range of activity based on what we're seeing, not just our own, but others as well.","Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And that West Coast cap rate, is that a buyer cap rate or a seller cap rate in terms of prop-13, it's a buyer, right?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes. That's not recent [ph] taxes, correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon from Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just have a follow-up question on Jana's question on renewal rate trends. Given the focus on the early renewals, what was the spread between what you sent the initial renewal notices out at and what you effectively captured? And did that spread vary much across your markets?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Paula. This is Sean. In terms of average -- let me quote average spread first, typically it runs anywhere from 60, 80 basis points. At times, it can get as wide as 100 basis points, depending on the posture that you're taking and how aggressive you're being on both the initial offer, as well as how much you might negotiate off of that. And it does vary a fair amount by market, depending on the strength of that market. So for example, we pushed pretty darn hard on Seattle, but as we started to see a little bit of softening in places I mentioned, like Redmond or Belltown, we backed off a little more quickly versus say LA. Or East Bay is a good example where you don't back off early at all just because you know you can replace that resident with someone else's who's willing to pay more. In the case of the East Bay during this quarter, moving rent change actually exceeded renewal rent change in the East Bay. So I don't have all the market by market spreads in front of me, but it does vary by market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up question for Sean. Can you just talk about what the trends were through the quarter? Sounds like from your commentary that rent and turnover perhaps both deteriorated at the end of the quarter. Is that correct?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Karin, this is Sean. That is a fair assessment. July and August were pretty healthy, but we did start to see the August lease expirations and September lease expirations start to weaken a bit. So if you looked at rent change through the quarter, it did soften, and the turnover rate peaked in September as well. So if you look at a combination of those different indicators, it did soften through the quarter. That is a correct statement.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And given that, are you concerned at all about being at 95% occupancy with those trends and sort of heading into the slower winter months, do you wish occupancy was a little bit higher?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes. I think what I indicated in my prepared remarks was that we're in the high 95s, 95. So as we move through the winter, relative to last year, we're going to give up a little bit of occupancy most likely given where we're starting in October. It's really a function of trying to optimize revenues best as we can. So in some markets, I mentioned like Boston in my prepared remarks, where we're getting somewhere in the neighborhood of 7% renewal increases and pretty healthy move-in rent increases as well. We are positioned to rent roll in the right way, we're comfortable doing that. So where we're starting from, high 95s, 96, I think is an okay place in terms of October. And we'll see how it unfolds as we move through the quarter, but I think it's a fine place to be there.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just last question. Did you give us what rent to income was this quarter?","Sean J. Breslin","It's about 20%. It hasn't really changed on a year-over-year basis overall [ph] this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sean, just going back to the last question. Just kind of can you talk a little bit about the leasing strategy for kind of the fourth quarter, first quarter just given where the occupancy levels are? Would you expect to dial back, maybe even push, go flat in terms of new leases and try to pick that occupancy backup and position yourself for the second quarter, third quarter of next year? Or are you kind of -- or is there a sense that 95%, 95 rate's a pretty good run rate from here?","Sean J. Breslin","Mike, the way we think about it, as I mentioned, is trying to optimize the revenue growth for each market, which does dictate maybe a slightly different strategy. But in terms of just global comments, what I'd say is that as you move through the fourth quarter, you don't want to give up too much on pricing, just given demand patterns in the fourth quarter are typically slower. So you're not necessarily going to move price a lot to gain a lot of occupancy because you're not going to gain quite as much during the fourth quarter as you might in some of the other quarters where demand patterns just represent more activity. So in terms of overall strategy, if we're in high 95s, 96 range for the quarter, that wouldn't be surprising. We wouldn't be trying to reduce rent significantly to try to get to 96.1 and 96.2 as an example. Typically, what you get give up in rent, what you're baked with for 6 to 12 months wouldn't compensate for a couple of months of an extra 5, 10 basis points as an example. Does it make sense in terms of how we are thinking about that?","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","No, that makes sense. And did you give where renewals notices went out for in November, December and kind of January at this point? Kind of what you're thinking about?","Timothy J. Naughton","I did. In terms of October, what is in hand in terms of committed renewals is about 5.25. And as you look forward to November and December, which is what's out right now, those offers are out in the mid-5s.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. As you look at the portfolio mix between, call it, Avalon and the eaves brand, was there any noticeable pricing difference in terms of rent growth during the quarter?","Sean J. Breslin","In terms of the 2 brands, what it might related to is sometimes people are asking about As versus Bs which is sort of a proxy for that as well. In terms of our portfolio, the As continue to outperform the Bs, kind of following a Reece [ph] or Axiometrics definition. And they have, over the last 4 quarters, if you're reading through some of the Axiometrics data, that gap has narrowed and in their view, Bs have started to outperform over the last couple of quarters. But it is a market-by-market analysis that you need to do in terms of which segment is outperforming better. For example, in Seattle, Bs seem to be outperforming right now and in D.C, that's the case as well. But if you look at Northern California, the As continue to perform pretty darn well relative to the Bs based on our portfolio mix.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. Then finally, Tom, in the last couple of quarters you talked about deliveries and how those yields have trended relative to underwriting. Just could you give us a sense, 2 deliveries in the quarter, I realized they're small, but how do they compare to underwriting?","Timothy J. Naughton","Mike, this is Tim. I think I've talked about that in the past. The deals that -- a couple of deals that just stabilized around -- they stabilized right around 7, they're up maybe 20 basis points or so from the original underwriting. The deals year-to-date are stabilized at around 7.5, and that's probably closer to 40, 50 basis points above original underwriting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","My question has actually been answered.","Operator","Your final question today will come from the line of David Bragg from Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Since you had a similar amount of assets under contract 3 months ago as you do today, can you talk about what you're specifically seeing in your disposition efforts? Have you seen some deals get re-traded?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, David, this Sean. When there was the peak run up in interest rates, when we're talking about a 10 year that was in the 2 9s and stuff like that, there was some saber rattling about price reduction and things like that. The deals that we were working on, one of them we dropped a buyer and the other one we picked up someone else, but really, the 2 big deals, the reason they're still there is the fact that they require local jurisdiction approval for certain things, one was the ground lease or is the ground lease, and the other one is subject to a county welfare [ph] provision, both of those just take time to work through the process to actually get the jurisdiction's approval. So that's why the volume hasn't really shifted a lot and not a lot has closed. But there is dimension, a fair amount that we'll be closing here before Thanksgiving.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So is there a quantifiable difference in your cap rates expectations for that pool now versus 3 months ago or is it the same?","Sean J. Breslin","No, it's the same.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Timothy J. Naughton","Okay, operator, thank you, and thanks, everybody for being on the call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley - Senior Director of Investor Relations","Thank you, Robbie, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities' third quarter 2015 earnings conference call.","Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.","As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO, for his remarks.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q3 call. Joining me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin, and Matt Birenbaum. Kevin and I have a few comments on the slides that we posted this morning, and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.","Starting on slide four, overall, results in Q3 were very strong driven by favorable operating fundamentals and healthy absorption of our lease up portfolio.","Some highlights for the quarter include Core FFO growth of more than 11.5% with year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 5.4% for Q3, which accelerated 70 basis points from Q2 and 110 basis points from Q1 and is the strongest rate of growth since 2012 that we've seen in our same-store portfolio. Including redevelopment, same-store revenue growth was 5.7% for the quarter.","Sequentially, same-store revenue growth came in at 2.6% or 2.7%, when you include redevelopment from Q2, which was actually the strongest sequential growth this cycle and in more than 10 years in our same-store portfolio. So, overall, we experienced very strong momentum in the operating portfolio this past quarter.","In addition, we're continuing to see strong external growth from our development portfolio as we remain on track to start and complete around $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of new development this year with average yields in the mid to high 6% range. Most of the development underway is already funded with permanent capital including over $600 million of capital raised in Q3.","Turning now to slide five, we have updated our outlook for the year by modestly raising Core FFO by a $0.01 at the midpoint from our mid-year update and raising same-store revenues by about 20 basis points to a midpoint of 5%, or 100 basis points from our original outlook and more than 100 basis points from what we actually experienced in 2014.","Same-store NOI growth is tracking at around 5.6% for the year at the midpoint, up 20 basis points from the mid-year update and 130 basis points from our original outlook.","Moving to slide six, our revised outlook is being driven by favorable trends in the operating portfolio as we're seeing same-unit rent growth remaining strong throughout the quarter, tracking above 6% or about 180 basis points above what we saw in Q3 of 2014, and new movements and renewals are both showing strength through the quarter with renewals running at right around 6.5% and new movements just under 6% for the same-store portfolio.","Now performance does vary across regions and this can be seen in slide seven. Starting in the upper left there, Northern California and Seattle are still generally leading the way although rent growth did moderate a bit in Q3. While job growth remains healthy in these markets, we are starting to see an increase in new supply and would expect that we'll continue to see some moderation in rent growth as a result.","In the upper right, New York and Boston are stable with same-unit rent growth of around 5%, very healthy levels, driven by healthy job growth in the 2%-plus range in those regions.","And then lastly, at the bottom of the page, Southern California and Mid-Atlantic are in the earlier stages of their recovery and\/or expansion cycle with growing strength most visible obviously in Southern California. But the outlook for the D.C. market continues to improve with job growth rebounding in recent quarters and deliveries starting to stabilize.","Moving on to slide eight, now, as we look out over the next couple of years, we do expect, and I think we've talked about this the last couple of quarters, we do expect performance to start to converge across regions. In general, most regions are expected to experience job growth roughly in line with new deliveries. The exceptions would include Seattle, if technology job growth slows a bit later in the tech cycle and economic cycle as expected, and Southern California, the region expected to have the strongest fundamentals over the next couple of years with modest level of new deliveries expected.","Moving to slide nine, within the regions, suburban supply is expected to only grow at about only half the rate of urban supply. In fact, suburban supply is not expected to outpace urban supply in any of our six regions over the next couple of years. While urban housing demands, on the other side of the equation, may be stronger than suburban, as we've seen in recent years, we do believe that the difference in demand is likely to be muted somewhat by the leading edge of the Millennials aging into their 30s where housing preferences start tilting more towards the suburbs.","I'd now like to turn it over to Kevin, who will provide some highlights on investment and capital activity for the quarter.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Thanks, Tim. Turning to slide 10, we highlight the current performance of the nine communities in lease-up under construction during the third quarter that was more than 20% leased, as of mid October.","As you can see in the slide, the performance of communities undergoing initial lease up is strong and exceeds our original underwriting expectations. Specifically, for these nine communities, which represent $780 million in total capital costs, the current weighted average monthly rent per home is $100 above initial expectations. In terms of yield performance, the weighted average initial projected stabilized yield for these communities is currently 6.7%, or 30 basis points higher than our original projection of 6.4% for these communities.","Turning to slide 11, with U.S. multifamily transaction volume exceeding $130 billion over the past year, the transaction market continues to benefit from strong buyer demands and remains a compelling capital source for funding development, for harvesting value from our Fund platform and from improving the asset quality of our portfolio. As you can see at the bottom left of the slide, we sold an asset in suburban Northern New Jersey last quarter and have sourced a total of $215 million year-to-date to be a wholly-owned dispositions with those assets being located in the Northeast and averaging 10 years of age and a 5.1% cap rate.","To further take advantage of current favorable transaction market conditions, we also opportunistically increased sales out of our limited life Fund platform, adding three additional Fund II sales in Q3, all of which sold at a compelling pricing of mid-4% cap rate.","On the bottom right, you can see that in our cost of capital heat map our three principal sources of capital range from being reasonably priced to very attractively priced today at least relative to their historical precedence with asset sales and unsecured debt screening as our most attractive sources of capital to fund ongoing development at the present time.","On slide 12, we highlight the company's funding position against the total projected capital cost of development under construction. As you can see here, we have only about $500 million in long-term capital left to source against the $3.3 billion in development under construction after taking into account capital already spent to date, unrestricted cash on hand and projected annual free cash flow of about $300 million.","As a result, in addition to our strong balance sheet position we enjoy a strong funding position on our external growth activity with about 84% to 85% of the value creation from ongoing development activity already locked in for our shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Tim.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well thanks, Kevin. Just a couple closing thoughts. Obviously 2015 is shaping up to be another strong year. We are seeing double digit growth in Core FFO for the fourth year out of the last five and total Core FFO growth, as you see on slide 13, since 2010 has been almost 90% versus the sector median of right around 50% which equates into about 500 basis points of outperformance and growth compounded annually over that five-year period.","Just given that all markets to some extent have experienced a healthy recovery, the differentiator really has been capital allocation which has really driven the outperformance. As we estimate that, about roughly 45% of this growth has come from external investment activity and about 55% from organic growth from the existing stabilized portfolio during that time.","Importantly, we believe we are well positioned to continue to outperform given that $6 billion to $7 billion development pipeline of compelling development opportunities. Much of that that is currently underway is already funded and a balance sheet that provides a great deal of flexibility to accretively fund future development.","So with that, operator, we'd now like to open the line for questions. Operator, Robbie, are we opening the line for questions? Okay. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Sorry. And we'll go first to Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. In your investor presentation last quarter you had a handful of slides indicating that we were in the middle of the cycle both in terms of U.S. economic conditions, as well as apartment fundamentals. Has the economic volatility and performance of the credit markets in the last three months changed your view on either of these?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Nick, Tim here. Obviously just looking at the slowdown in job growth and some of the volatility we've seen in the credit markets it makes you \u2013 you keep an eye on it. But no, I mean, fundamentally it hasn't changed our view in terms of where we are in the economic cycle and how long the apartment cycle is likely to play out.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And then can you talk more about what you're seeing in D.C. and if you expect the modest recovery that you've seen this year to continue into 2016?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Nick, it's Sean. Based on what we've experienced this year and the outlook for job growth, as you look forward into 2016, the expectation is there will be a continued but modest recovery across the market. Obviously, it depends on where you are within each market in terms of the supply considerations as to whether that recovery is moving on along a little faster, a little slower.","So, for us, what we've seen most recently is that D.C. has been performing relatively well, given the positioning of our assets that we have, with very little exposure to some of the heavier supply sub-markets within the district followed by suburban Virginia and then suburban Maryland. But as you move into 2016, the supply characteristics sub-market by sub-market starts to shift. So it really depends on the competition of your portfolio and what your exposure is to new supply. In general, though, we expect the entire market to get modestly better as you move into 2016.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And then just last question on the cost of capital heat map, I'm a little surprised that the equity doesn't screen a little better given that's based on a stock price of $185, which is 5% premium to consensus NAV and pretty close to an all-time high price. So I'm wondering what goes into that equity component of the map?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Nick, this is Kevin. In terms of the equity temperature, as we've talked about it in the past, there are four components that load into that with different weightings. About half the weighting relates to how our stock price looks compared to other investor choices, that is, the S&P 500 yield and the BAA bond yield. And against those two items we're in the kind of the mid-60% range.","If you look at the other half, which is really more of a corporate finance perspective or an issuer perspective, we prescribe about 40% weighting to how we compare to consensus NAV. And on that basis we're about 55% in terms of a percentile ranking. But to your point, in terms of the attractiveness of the absolute pricing, that's reflected in our AFFO yields, which is about 10% of the weighting. And on that dimension, we're about an 80-percentile ranking.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Appreciate the breakdown.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. I was hoping, first off, you could talk a little bit more about the expense pressures you faced in the quarter. And looking at your guidance it looks like it's going to \u2013 expense pressures get easier in the fourth quarter. Maybe you could talk about what's driving expense pressures easing and how we should think about some of that heading into next year?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure, Nick. This is Sean. I mean, if you look at the quarter, there's a fair amount of noise in there. So just kind of walking through it, 60% of the year-over-year increase in the quarter really related to two items, insurance and taxes. Taxes were up about 8.5% or $2.9 million. About $1 million of that relates to supplemental assessments that were accruals reversed in a prior period in last year which created obviously a headwind in terms of the year-over-year comp. And then the balance is rate and assessment in different markets across the country, particularly the East Coast markets and a little bit of a pilot burn off in New York as well.","And then on the insurance side, we had the property renewal and then you have the timing of claims and recoveries in insurance, which is extremely volatile, that was up 20%, 21% if you look at the third quarter. But our expectation for the full calendar year is that's going to thin out and be closer to probably 10%, 11%, as an example. So we're going to see that trim out.","And then on some of the other topics in the quarter, repairs and maintenance being up is a couple of things. One is the timing of maintenance projects during that particular season when you're doing a lot of roof work and other things, as well as turnover costs during the quarter, which is sort of by design. We talked about last quarter shifting our lease expirations around to take advantage of the rental rates we thought we could achieve during particularly June, July, August but even heading into September, which we did realize in the form of our sequential results which were quite strong. But obviously we incurred more turnover costs during that period of time to actually get those units turned and get people into them.","And to make one other comment just on the marketing side, the year-over-year increase and really the year-to-date increase as well on marketing relates to a couple of different things. One is in the third quarter a little more concentrated Internet advertising cost, which obviously relates to shifts in lease expirations and needing to spur more of a demand in the third quarter of this year relative to the third quarter of last year. And then the other component that goes in there is customer service incentives related to either heavy CapEx at a building or when you have unexpected events, floods or otherwise that an apartment becomes uninhabitable and we had a little bit of that in the third quarter.","And one thing to keep in mind, on a year-to-date basis is, we're still carrying the costs from the first quarter from the winter storms, which included repairs and maintenance, snow removal, other things. So all that's reflected in either repairs or maintenance or marketing costs.","As indicated in the release, we still expect to be within the range we provided and tighten that range so the midpoint is still 3.5%. And what you're going to see is, as I mentioned, there are things that occurred in the third quarter related to our shift to lease expiration strategy that won't materialize quite as much in the fourth quarter. Lease expirations were down about 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In addition to that, there was a lot of noise in taxes in the third quarter. As I mentioned, we still expect property taxes to be in line with our original expectation for the year which probably is in the mid-3% range.","So if you put all those pieces together in terms of the shift in activity in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and some of the one-time events, particularly related to taxes and insurance, you'd solve to getting sort of into that mid-3%s in terms of expenses for the full year.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","All right. That's very helpful. Just one other question on your development rights page. Can you break out for the Metro New York-New Jersey region how many of those projects are actually in New York City proper? And then whether you would at all think about perhaps selling some of those projects since there is such a strong demand to build or to find land in New York City and yet it's hard for people to do so, meaning that those projects would have some pretty good land value today.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Sure. This is Matt. I can speak to that. I believe we only have one development right in New York City itself right now, which is the big Columbus Circle site. So that's a big deal but most of those 14 development rights, obviously everything else is not in the City itself. And that deal, as we've talked about, we may sell a piece of it, either the retail component and\/or we're exploring different options including for sale condominiums there either directly or through others. So one of the great things about that site is it's incredibly flexible, the zoning is very flexible, we're not planning on pursuing a 421-a there, so it'd be 100% market rate. So we have a lot of options there.","But generally speaking, we generally aren't in the market to kind of buy and flip land as a general rule and really not equipped (19:56) to do that as a REIT frankly.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. I was just curious how you guys are thinking about your development funding plans today given that leverage has come down half a turn. So it seems like you have some debt capacity but you did mention that asset sales are a more attractive source of funds. So how should we think about the balance of those two going forward?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Austin, this is Kevin. A couple comments here. First, in terms of the timing of our \u2013 describing our capital plan, we're still in the budget process and we won't really have a precise guidance in terms of net external capital needs for 2016 until we get to the fourth quarter call in January.","But that said, in terms of how we look at pricing today, as I indicated, asset sales and unsecured debt screen as most attractive. The common (21:03) equity pricing is attractively priced from an issuer or corporate finance perspective, as reflected in my earlier comment, where on an AFFO yield basis our share price is in the 80th percentile. However, asset sales screen as relatively more attractive today based on sort of the percentile ranking that you see in the heat map, which was the 96th percentile.","So that's how we look at our capital choices today. Of course, capital market conditions change continually both in terms of the absolute pricing as well as the relative pricing. And so that's why we don't really comment with precision in terms of our future capital or transaction market activity.","But that said, there are sort of two points to think about as you fine tune your models for what our funding might look like over the next year. The first you pointed out, which is at 4.9 times net debt to EBITDA our leverage in the third quarter was tracking a bit below our target leverage, which is 5 times to 6 times net debt to EBITDA. And so we do have capacity for debt issuance at that level, particularly when you consider the de-leveraging impact of continued market rent growth and stabilizing developments, which serve to drive that number down, all else equal.","And then the second point to think about when you come up with your assumptions for our funding next year is that next year we have below average level of debt maturities with about $280 million of debt coming due next year compared to about an average level of $500 million to $600 million. So, all-in-all, our net external capital need next year is likely to be a little bit less than it is and has been in recent years and our need for equity, whether it's in the form of asset sales or common equity issuance is likely to be a little bit more modest than it has been in recent years.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for the detail there. And then just curious what are the metrics or components that make up that 96% today on the heat map?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","It's basically a measure of current pricing relative to the trend line, and we have dataset that we use \u2013 it goes back to I think about 2001.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the detail.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next questions from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I was wondering if you could share a new and renewal rates for October and renewals for November\/December?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure, Jana. This is Sean. As it relates to October, we're basically running at a blended rent change at 5.6%, which is renewals running at 6.8%, which is slightly higher than we achieved in the third quarter, but new move-in rents starting to trend down as they typically do at this time of year into the low 4% range.","And then in terms of renewal offers for November and December, we're basically in the high 7% range, and as we typically indicate, as you move into the fourth quarter, you probably see that the spread between initial offers and where they actually settle somewhere it's between 100 basis points to 150 basis points.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And on the supply side you provided on page nine, I would think it looks like a good run rate for you through 2017. But particularly in your markets, the rate to build in these suburban markets are very difficult. Do you see this favorable supply-demand outlook going further than 2017?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jana, it's Tim. It's obviously a function of the macro environment on the demand side. As we've talked about, we're about 20 quarters, 22 quarters into this particular expansion. The 90s lasted 40 quarters. So we do think the economic cycle, the macro cycle could last into 2019, just looking at historical precedence.","But on the supply side, we talked about that last quarter. It bears watching. There are a lot of people, builders, homebuilders, commercial developers, who are doing a little bit more in the multi-family world, the multi-family space.","So if you look at it from our perspective, if anything we probably expect it to trend down a little bit, just based upon opportunity and being later in the cycle and some markets just getting a little bit distorted where pricing gets out a little bit ahead of fundamentals and just makes less sense from a capital allocation standpoint to take that kind of risk. So we're geared to do about $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion a year right now for the next two to three years. I think it kind of remains to be seen after that. But if I had to guess, I would suspect it would trend down from there.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Greg Van Winkle with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory A. Van Winkle - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. I just wanted to get your thoughts on your Connecticut portfolio. One of your peers announced they're selling all of their Connecticut portfolio and we've heard some reports that the market is slowing down there a bit. What are your expectations for that market? And would you consider trying to do some opportunistic pruning yourself there?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","First part of that question...","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Greg. This is Sean. Maybe I'll take the first part and then Tim can comment on the second part.","In terms of the Connecticut portfolio, for the most part the way we think about it is indirectly it kind of moves as New York moves a bit in terms of job creation. There's certainly \u2013 Connecticut has some of its own job centers, of course, if you're in Stanford or depending on where you are. But it tends to run sort of slow and steady for us is the way I'd describe it, typically trailing the New York region. But it's not uncommon to see rent change in that market running \u2013 New York is running say in the mid-5%, Connecticut's probably running around 4%, typically lagging 100 basis points to 150 basis points. Now it tends to be slow and steady and adds some diversification benefits to the portfolio in some form in terms of the slow and steady nature of the portfolio in Connecticut for the most part. And as it relates to trading activity there, Tim, do you want to talk about that?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. To the extent we were to do more asset sales in Connecticut or frankly any part of suburban Northeast, it's really more strategic rather than I would say opportunistic and it's much a function of kind of where we are from a portfolio management standpoint and the opportunity we have to continue to build in those markets and just not getting overweighted in those markets.","Having said that, we wouldn't rule out doing something that's opportunistic. Where we think there's a portfolio of premium that might exist just through the transaction structure itself being a large portfolio and you might think that right now just given the wall of private equity capital that's out there and\/or just an arbitrage opportunity where we just think the market value has got ahead of intrinsic value for a variety of reasons. So it's not just kind of a slowdown in a market. To us it's much about whether we think it's going to slow down more than maybe the market thinks it's going to slow down and that's what creates sort of the arbitrage from our perspective. So that would be how we would look at it from an opportunistic standpoint. But increased sales activity there would likely be really more strategic in nature from a portfolio allocation standpoint.","Gregory A. Van Winkle - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And that kind of leads into my next question, what are your thoughts on asset pricing? And generally how sustainable this low cap rate environment is as we move into 2016? I know you don't necessarily need to do, from a funding standpoint, any kind of big portfolio deal but what would your appetite be for doing something like your competitor did where you sell a sizable portfolio even if there isn't something you necessarily identified to deploy the proceeds into?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Maybe I could start on that last part because we've gotten a lot of questions offline about that. First of all, obviously our peer did announce a large portfolio transaction yesterday. And obviously, we thought it made a lot of sense for them, just given sort of a large non-core basket of assets and markets, around $6 billion I think it was. And just given what their strategy has been, which is to transform their portfolio and move to fewer more urban markets.","So, from our standpoint, it's just a question of timing if that's our strategy, and it's hard to argue that it's not a good time to sell non-core assets today, just given the liquidity and activity in the private equity market.","But for us, the same set of circumstances aren't really true. It makes less sense for us. It's not out of the question. We have much smaller basket of what we would consider non-core assets. I think you can just think about what our strategy has been over the years that makes sense. We've really built our portfolio more organically over time through the development process and one-off acquisitions where we are an investor builder. We're not a merchant builder to be clear. We're building a market that we intend to own for a long time. And we've really used the disposition lever, if you will, really to prune the portfolio over time. We've sold $300 million to $400 million a year, typically cap rates around 5%, unlevered IRR is at 12% to 13% over the last five years, closer to 14% over the last 10 years. So we try to be smart about that when we're selling but we've really been able to do it really kind of in a more measured way, in part we don't have \u2013 we're not an UPREIT. We're not a heavy secured bar. We just don't have the same kind of frictional costs that maybe some others in the sector might do.","So it's not out of question doing something opportunistic but I think it's just less compelling for us just given kind of what we've already done to date and just kind of our business model.","Gregory A. Van Winkle - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. And then last one quickly on Seattle and Bellevue, you guys have obviously stated you kind of have a strategy of preferring suburbs right now broadly. Bellevue is a suburb where we're expecting to see a lot supply growth over the next couple years. And I think I'm right that most of your exposure in the Seattle area is in that Bellevue submarket. Is that still a market where you like being more suburban exposed or could that be kind of an exception to the rule where you wouldn't mind shifting some of that exposure to the more urban core in Seattle? And, I guess, just your thoughts generally on how Bellevue is set up to weather the supply over the next couple years.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me start with that more broadly and then I'll turn it over to Sean to talk maybe more specifically about Bellevue itself.","Just to be clear, our investment strategy is focused on great MSAs with great structural advantages and we favor certain submarkets within each of those MSAs, some urban, some suburban. And we think urban, just to be clear, has been a compelling opportunity over the last cycle. We created a new brand around it, particularly as it related to the Millennial segment.","But as it relates to when we make bets, I mean we're agnostic. It depends on where we are in the cycle and how urban is pricing versus suburban and it's going to vary across markets. And while generally we're seeing more supply in urban markets, there are some suburban markets like Bellevue that you point out where we're seeing a lot of supply. Having said that, downtown Seattle is still seeing a lot of supply from a comparison standpoint. But, Sean, maybe you can just talk a little bit more about Bellevue and what we're seeing there.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Greg, just to give you some perspective, certainly we're going to see an increase in supply in Bellevue as you move into 2016 but it hasn't been zero. As you look back over the last 12 months to 18 months, instead of running probably in the 4%, 4.5% range, supply is projected to increase up to 7% to 8% of inventory next year across Bellevue.","And the one thing you have to keep in mind is Bellevue is a pretty broad market. You have sort of what you might think of as the CBD of Bellevue but then there's a lot of suburban neighborhoods where there's product coming online as well as it bleeds over towards Redmond. But if you think about what the supply is today that's been coming online, we're still doing rent change in that market that is on the renewal side 8% to 9% and if you look across the Bellevue assets, they've been holding in right in line there with the rest of the East side portfolio that we have over in Redmond or anything that we have up in Lynnwood. The laggard has been the downtown sort of Queen Anne market in terms of rent change, which has been in the 4% to 5% range, as compared to 8% to 9%, 10% across the East side and the North end.","So, as you look forward, there'd probably be the expectation for some slowing in Seattle overall including what's happening in the Bellevue, Redmond and other East side markets. But if our recent experience is helpful in projecting next year it probably is going to hold up better than people think.","Gregory A. Van Winkle - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dan Oppenheim with Zelman Associates.","Dan M. Oppenheim - Zelman Partners LLC","Thanks very much. I was wondering a little bit about the Chino Hills development, where, I guess, the western edge of the Inland Empire, but normally would expect developments for you to be a little bit more coastal. Wondering how you think about that in terms of just reflecting some of the challenges in getting sites in Southern California, and particularly just wondering, given whether it's Chino Hills or a little slightly east in Eastvale, the for sale market is not so expensive there, so there can be some opportunities and issues with turnover.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Hey, Dan, this is Matt. I guess I can take that one and Sean may want to chime in as well being a native of Southern California. But we just saw that as a good development opportunity. We do have an appetite to continue to do more in Southern California. It was a very low risk kind of structure in terms of the deal. It had already been approved. So it was entitled. It's a very simple three-storey block-up product, it's a very low execution risk and assets are trading in that sub-market at cap rates that are still significantly below where we see the yield on that deal. So we think there's reasonable value creation there. It is in a great school district and actually single-family values right around there are in the $500,000 to $800,000 range and even north of there. So it's actually a pretty attractive living environment, good retail. We probably aren't looking to go further east certainly but we think it's a fine deal.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","The only thing I'd add is that \u2013 I mean, what you've seen from us is certainly a focus on some of the coastal sub-markets and more infield locations, whether it's Huntington Beach or along the coast, just down towards San Diego or up in Hollywood. But we have looked at opportunities in what we think are some supply protected sub-markets that some people may think of as sort of B sub-markets, but there is demand for some of the higher end housing that we can provide in some of these markets. So if you look at our development attachment you'll see sub-markets like Glendora, obviously you referenced Chino Hills. We completed a couple of properties in San Dimas and sub-markets like that where we think we're producing pretty good value creation at a relatively supply protected sub-market that may not be a target for a lot of other competitors.","Dan M. Oppenheim - Zelman Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. I had a question on the change in your lease expiration strategy resulting in the occupancy decline this quarter. It sounds like that you believe the occupancy dip is just a one-off, and I just wanted to clarify that was the case. And also if you could just update us on the percentage of your portfolio that you expect to expire each quarter?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure, John. This is Sean. A couple comments. One, in terms of occupancy, occupancy has rebounded and we're back up in the call it 95.6% or 95.7% range in terms of physical occupancy. And we would expect it to hold probably in that range for the quarter, maybe slightly higher, slightly lower depending on how things evolve here.","One of the things you have to watch for is lease breaks which typically represent somewhere around 30% of all move outs that we tried to adjust our lease expirations to make sure that when you include lease breaks, the volume of inventory that we're supplying to the market is appropriate, given what the demand patterns are in each market, and each one a little bit different from a seasonal perspective. When you move into the fourth quarter, as I referenced earlier, we expect expirations to be down about 12% year over year.","And one thing to keep in mind is managing lease expirations is sort of a continuous process because you have lease breaks and other things that occur, as I referenced. So you're always trying to figure out what are the offers that you need to make to people versus not make to people so that things stay where you sort of need them to stay.","If you think about it, generally speaking, what I'd say is across the quarter it is typically about 20% in Q1 and then up to 28%, 32% and then back down to about 20%. That's been the historical average. To give you some perspective, the activity in the third quarter was closer to about 36% of inventory, and the fourth quarter we're expecting, depending on lease breaks again, which we'll know at the end of the year what exactly it was, probably closer to 17% or 18% of transactions in the portfolio.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And then on the stabilized development yields on slide 10 of your presentation, it dropped a little bit this quarter to 6.7% versus that same number in the second quarter presentation. I know some of this is due to mix, but I was wondering if there was anything else driving this number?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","This is Matt. No. It really is \u2013 the basket changes every quarter, and I can't remember what rolled off last quarter, but we had \u2013 we're always adding new deals and old deals rolling off, so as the geographic mix changes, that's going to move around a little bit.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. So nothing on the cost side?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","No.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then finally for me is can you provide some more color on the sales on Value Added Fund II this quarter, either IRR or economic gains? It seems like it's lower than what you achieve in your wholly owned portfolio and if there's anything we should read into that?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","John, this is Kevin. It's a private vehicle, so we don't disclose unlevered IRRs for that vehicle. The gains and the performance of that second fund has been robust, nothing short of robust and a lot of that is driven based on the timing. We had our final closing on that fund in April of 2009. So those assets were bought in 2009, 2010 and 2011, so they all enjoy and have enjoyed to the extent we've harvested those assets, significant gains.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So given that success, are there any plans to raise additional funds?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","That's a topic we've discussed before in the past. We certainly have liked the fund business, but from a strategic perspective it does raise some complications. In particular when we have a fund actively investing in new product, it does tend to represent our exclusive acquisition vehicle which prevents the wholly-owned company, the parent company from buying on our own account. So it does create a little bit of a conflict there that is something that is a bit of a challenge. And from a relative size point of view it's a smaller business relative to where we are now and tends to not to move the value creation needle quite as much. So while we've liked the business and certainly have benefited from it, we're not actively involved in trying to raise another fund right now.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning. Tim, just a first question. You were talking to, in response to one of the earlier questions on dispositions, whether large scale or small, that you guys view it more tactically. And I'm just sort of curious, is that because there's sort of asset base that you guys seek to maintain to support the development program vis-\u00e0-vis your credit metrics, or is it more fundamental thing that you wouldn't want to sell more and have to \u2013 or actually get your thoughts on selling more to pay a special dividend, if within the current Avalon structure and funding the development program, if there is enough room to do something large to return capital to shareholders, and clearly you guys have created, between your development spread and where the assets trade in the private market.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. There's quite a bit in there. Let's see where to start. In terms of the volume that we can do just from a tax and sort of capital efficiency standpoint, what we're doing today basically is the level that you can do before you start getting into an issue of potential distribution, so, of gains to \u2013 through a special dividend.","Now as I mentioned before, I mean, that doesn't mean we wouldn't do one. I'm just not sure that from our standpoint the conditions are such that it makes sense in terms of pricing today. For instance, relative to just NAV, where we think most assets trade relative to intrinsic value. And then we just don't have that much non-core. Again, I think what our peer did made a lot of sense just given kind of where they were positioning their portfolio. We've been basically in the same markets for 20 years. And so for everything we do is either additive or is really about pruning and managing the portfolio at the margin rather than kind of wholesale, making wholesale transformative changes at this point. It's how we looked at the Archstone transaction. For us it was additive. We had to raise a lot more external capital as part of that transaction even though we were the smaller part of that transaction.","Again, because we weren't looking at some of our existing portfolio as trade capital, to be honest. So there's always some conditions which it could make sense to do a special dividend. We did it back during the credit crisis when asset sales were kind of another way to sort of tap the secured financing of the GSE market beyond just debt, and there was always some unique conditions that you might \u2013 you have to be open to. I'm just not sure it makes as much sense for us as it might for others in the sector...","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then Kevin, in response to one of the earlier questions on explaining the cost of equity, why it's the lower of the three, you mentioned, if I heard correctly, something about relation to S&P valuations and corporate credit. If you could just expand on that, because I would think that the big driver would be where your implied cap rate is and FFO yield and the value creation of investing the capital versus how Avalon's stock relates to other corporate public companies.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Alex. Yeah. I probably should have explained it a little bit better. We've talked about the heat map in the past and \u2013 so maybe a little bit of review is in order. In terms of the equity pricing there are four components that have their individual weights that we use to drive the overall percentile ranking, which in this case is 62% for our equity temperature. Two of the components, as I mentioned are really more from an investor perspective, while the other two relate more to a corporate finance or an issuer perspective, which is I think the point you're making. And this is just simply how we've constructed it. We find it to be relatively informative to look at both sides of the equation, if you will.","In terms of the components that relate to how our share price might look from an investment perspective to an investor who can invest across different asset markets, we look at how our share price, the relative earnings or AFFO yield on our share price relative to the earnings yield on the S&P 500 and that's a 25% weighting, and then also against Baa bond yields. We look at that spread between our AFFO yield and Baa bond yields and that's a 25% weighting.","And we find that to be pretty informative. And basically what those tell you today is that, that our stock in terms of its current pricing today relative to those two markets is somewhat attractively priced but not terrifically so, and as the temperature screens in kind of the mid-60 percentile ranking for those two items.","I think what you're really getting at is trying to understand how we look at things from a corporate finance or issuer perspective. And there the two metrics we look at are how our share price trades relative to NAV. And for the purpose of this exercise we compare it to consensus NAV. From an actual corporate finance perspective we compare it to our own estimate of NAV, of course, but we don't publish that. But to give investor's insight into our thinking on that we compare it to consensus NAV. And so that measure really today gets a 40% weighting because it matters a whole lot to us how we think about it because fundamentally when we're sourcing equity, we can either issue common equity or we can sell assets. But we also want look at how our share price trades on an AFFO yield basis to get a sense of kind of our earnings multiple and how attractive it looks like on that dimension and that gets a 10% weighting.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Kevin, if I could just maybe because, Alex, I don't think sort of fully answered your question. I think sort of broadly underneath it is really kind of getting at the heart of capital allocation. And obviously I think with the sales of a big portfolio, it just raised a lot of discussion around that issue and certainly at least within our space. And certainly asset sales are just one \u2013 as is raising equity, but asset sales one lever that we have. But from our standpoint, I mean, capital allocation is really so much more than that. It's about raising capital and how you deploy it, which Kevin's talking about how we raise it.","Just look at it in a very disciplined way in terms of the options we have available to us, how you deploy it, whether through acquisitions, whether through development, whether through re-development, which market you're deploying it, how you grow it. To grow NAV and residual value and you can recognize, as a public entity, it can be recognized or materialized through a number of ways. Certainly through selling assets and showing attractive unlevered IRR, through growing free cash flow, which as we point out on the slide we've been able to grow Core FFO by around 12% compounded this cycle versus 7% for the sector. It's how you grow dividends which we've been able to grow for 5.5% kind of on a compounded basis over 20 years, its total shareholder return that could be recognized that way. So there's a number of ways that it could be recognized, but there are opportunities every once in a while as we understand it, it's arbitraged just pricing in different markets and try to take advantage of it.","We measure ourselves by the results on all those metrics, not on any one of those and \u2013 but it's about doing all these activities well that ultimately allows you to outperform from our perspective. And as I said earlier in my prepared comments, capital allocation really is the differentiator. It's really kind of you look across all markets. Other than the West Coast which has dramatically outperformed, we've had a really healthy recovery. And so I don't feel like I maybe did a good enough job at the beginning, but I think that's really what kind of occurred, as I sort of reflected on your question.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. I mean, it definitely creates some good NAREIT conversations, but it would seem like there's an odds between what investors find your stock attractive when it's super cheap, whereas you guys find it attractive when it's fairly or healthfully valued, so that would seem to be a tension between the two, but probably that's good for a NAREIT discussion. So, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from William Kuo with Cowen & Company.","William Kuo - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the urban versus suburban discussion. With your increasing focus developing in suburban albeit infill transit oriented and your comments about favorable supply trends and your prepared remarks about the demographic wave that might move further out into the suburbs. Is it your view that over this next apartment cycle that these suburban markets might outperform urban, especially versus kind of prior cycles?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","To be honest we think it ebbs and flows, to be honest over the course of a cycle. And again it's one of the reasons why we say we're agnostic. We do think there are points in cycles where things just get either overpriced or undervalued and we \u2013 it's our job to trade on that just like it is the investor's job. They may like a number of different names in the apartment sector, but you allocate capital based upon price, price has to enter into the equation. And if everyone sold stock today, everyone would get the same price but everyone would have a different return and it would depend on when the price and timing of that investment, that investment was made. And just like investors are on this call, we're trying to trade on our business intelligence in our markets, in part that has been developed over 20 years of having a presence in these markets.","And while we can like a thesis a lot, we like it at a value and at a price. So, over the next couple of years, would I expect suburban to outperform urban? Yes. I would, largely based upon what's happening on the supply \u2013 the supply dynamic and to a lesser extent on the demand side. If you look at just \u2013 what's going to be growing over the next 10 years is that 35 to 44 aged cohort, their propensity to live in urban environment is less than the 25 to 34 cohort, which is going to start to flatten in terms of its growth. We're actually expecting to see twice the rental housing demand from the 35 to 44 cohort than the 25 to 34 cohort, and they have a higher propensity to live in the suburbs. And so that was really kind of what was behind that comment. We do think there's been a little bit of a secular shift to urban living, all other things being equal to living in a urban an environment, but you can't ignore the demographics and life stage that people are in.","William Kuo - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's fair. And then maybe just switching gears here, I wanted to see how you guys thought about to the extent that companies like Airbnb have had the effect of adding to hotel supply by potentially removing housing supply, have you assessed the impact of the passage of Prop F in San Francisco, the impact that would have on supply and how that would affect your internal outlook \u2013 internal growth outlook for that market?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Hey, Bill. This is Sean. Really few things actually, one maybe as a follow-up to your last question, and then I'll address the Airbnb. Yeah. Tim was talking about the performance of urban versus suburban over the next couple of years. Just as a follow-up to that, we are seeing that difference occur now in the markets. We highlighted that a little bit in the last quarter call, and we continued to see pretty good spread between urban and suburban performance. At this point, just to give you some sense, in our portfolio the suburban assets are running on a year-over-year basis closer to about 6% as compared to the urban assets that are in the low fours. Some of that's a function of geographic mix, but even if you look at the performance of the assets within the respective markets, for the most part we're seeing the suburban assets outperform and in some cases it's a reflection of sort of the lower price point B assets in certain markets, but also just to even some of the newer wood frame deals in some of our suburban submarkets as compared to the urban environment, where you are seeing a fair amount of supply, whether it's the core of Boston, downtown Seattle, downtown LA still a lot of inventory, South of Market in San Francisco, et cetera, et cetera, so just to follow up on that for you.","And then as it relates to Airbnb, yeah, there's obviously a lot of chatter out there in the hotel space and it's sort of bleeding into our space, at this point, in terms of the impact of Airbnb on various businesses. There is a number of initiatives out there including what you cited in San Francisco. It's being taken up in some other markets as well. It's hard to know exactly how that's going to play out. There's a lot of money being thrown at it from both sides. I would just say that we're continuing to evaluate the potential impact on our business in terms of listings that might be occurring at our communities, what opportunities we may or may not have to participate in it. There's a lot of land use regulations and zoning issues involved in it, there's tax issues. So I think it's going to be several quarters before this is fully resolved and we understand the potential impact on our business. It's probably a little easier to understand on the hotel business at this point than it is in our business, but I'd say the industry overall is still studying the potential impact given the listings that we're seeing. It's creating more inventory and supply in some of our markets and Tim may have a few...","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. This is a broader comment. I mean, it's a disruptive technology, right? When you look at all disruptive technologies, whether it's Uber or others, the regulatory framework always follows and it can take a long time to play out. It may not be a couple quarters. This may really be playing over the next 5 to 10 years in terms of the impact on our business. And there's potentially ways for us to play it that are both potentially positive as well as potentially it could be detrimental in terms of the customer and the resident experience for those who aren't necessarily looking for transient demand right next door to where they live. So I think it's really not even in the first inning at this point in terms of the impact ultimately to the apartment space, but I think it's going to be a while before it fully plays out.","William Kuo - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much. And then maybe just a quick housekeeping thing, you gave renewals and new rents in October of 6%, 8% and 4%. What were they October 2014?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","October 2014, I don't have those right in front of me. I'd be happy to send you notes later with that data if you'd like it.","William Kuo - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That'd be great. Thank you. That's all I had.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Good morning. I may have missed this earlier on, but could you talk about the cap rate for the Lyndhurst disposition?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Sure, Tayo. This is Matt. That was the low 5s%. I think we said it was about a 5.1%.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Okay. 5.1%. Okay. That's helpful. And then, in regards to operating expenses, thanks for the outlook on 4Q 2015. (58:45) parts of that that you guys can control, but I'm just curious how, again how confident do you feel like things like the property taxes and the insurance start to come back in the quarter? Or how possible is it to kind of get another negative surprise as it pertains to some of those line items?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Tayo, this is Sean. As I mentioned earlier, on the property tax side I mean different things can happen, of course, but the level of an unknowns at this point sitting in October is far less than what it was certainly last quarter. And in terms of the change in taxes as an example I wouldn't say that was unexpected. We had the supplemental assessment reversal on the accrual in Q3 of last year. So we knew that was coming and we expected third quarter to be a bit of a spike in taxes. On the insurance side, we sort of know what the premiums are. Now, at this point, that's big, just the timing of recoveries and claims and things of that sort, so there's a little bit of noise in insurance and taxes potentially, but not nearly as significant as what we experienced in the third quarter.","And then the other categories, do reflect sort of our expectations based on lease expirations being down, turn volume likely being down. So unless you had a significant spike in lease breaks, you should see some of the R&M numbers sort of trend down. And then typically you're going into a season where some of the scheduled projects that we have on the maintenance side start to thin out because a lot of that's done in the summer time. So we have reasonable visibility, it's not 100% confidence, that's why we provide a range. But we have reasonable certainty as it relates to the range we have provided.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Hello, guys. Can we go back to the Airbnb topic real quick? I know you mentioned you might want to take part in the benefits of having Airbnb in your communities. But what is your view on having a tenant run an operation currently? And is there any incremental liability for Avalon?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Still really too early to tell in terms of kind of all the implications. I mean, when I was talking about on the positive side, there's potential we could share in some of that revenue. And I mean, honestly, when you look at some of the markets we do business in, and particularly in some of the urban markets, they are having sort of a virtual roommate. It allows people to pay more potentially for in terms of rent if they can off load some of those costs.","What we do know is generally people aren't taking in somebody that's taken a couch or an extra bedroom. They're usually taking a whole unit. I think more than 85% are taking a whole unit and it tends to be a lot of international travel right now and it does violate a lot of zoning codes in terms of staying.","So for the most part we \u2013 we've talked with Airbnb and they've been very transparent about it. But for the most part, it's being done under kind of a cloak of secrecy by the resident who's meeting somebody at the coffee shop around the corner. And that will play itself out. It's sort of the regulatory sort of world, sort of starts to sort itself out, and we develop our own strategy in terms of how much we want to embrace it and\/or frankly not facilitate it. So like I said in my first remarks, we're not even in the first inning in terms of sort through that.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's fair. I think everyone is trying to get a handle on the topic. Looking at rental rate increases, are you seeing any markets where there's price sensitivity or an increase in bad debt expense?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Wes. This is Sean. In terms of price sensitivity, I guess, what I would say to that is given where we are on the cycle with above trend rents, there's certainly more price sensitivity than if you look on average over time. Every market is a little bit different in terms of sensitivity. I'd say the markets where it's probably most pronounced are the ones you might expect, which is Northern California and Seattle, where you've had high single-digit, double-digit rent increases now for two to three years in some cases. So there's probably more price sensitivity there.","But if you look at it from a global perspective, on a year-over-year basis, average income in our portfolio of our residents is up about 6.5%. And if you look at that as it compares to year-over-year change and sort of affected move-in rents running in the mid 6s is sort of a parity at this point. So if you're seeing that kind of income growth out of our markets, we should be able to realize above trend rental rate growth on a sustainable basis.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks for taking the question.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. Just wanted to dig in more on the 35 to 44 demographic. It's obviously a demographic that tends to prefer the suburbs because school districts become relevant. But in this cycle, given kind of the Millennials' desire to be in the city and the amenities that come in the city, the move to the suburbs, do you think that just given that there aren't as many amenities in the suburbs, do you think that that demographic is more inclined to just buy a home at that point than rent in the suburbs?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","They might. It's interesting. If you actually look at behavior of the 25 to 34 segment, which most people would consider kind of the heart of the Millennials, they've actually changed their behavior less than the 35 to 44 segment in terms of urban living. In fact, their \u2013 I mean, a lot of it just comes back to affordability. In fact, their behavior, it hasn't changed hardly at all in the last five years in terms of the propensity to live in \u2013 it's like 30 basis points.","Conversely, the 35 to 44 segment, that's where \u2013 and I think it's really in the 35 to 40 segment if I had to guess, they've changed their behavior the most. And I think part of that is they're getting married a lot later, they're having kids a lot later, they're not at the school decision until maybe sometimes into their 40s when their kids are 5 or 6-years-old. And so, I think they're the ones that have probably been \u2013 and the data shows, that they've been extending their stay in an urban environment later.","I think a lot of it ultimately, like I said, I think a lot of it ultimately turns on schools and some of the options. People usually move sort of three big moves in their lives. One is after college. One is when the kids are getting ready for school, and the other is retirement. And there's certain things that can happen in a community that can help shape that. Certainly just urban environments being a more livable place. Some of these emerging neighborhoods be transit, the quality of transit improving and everything else has helped stimulate some demand within that age cohort, but ultimately if schools don't get better, I still think there's a double back to the suburbs for most of that population.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's helpful. And, secondly, just on (1:06:12) going into next year, 2015 for the most part, obviously your West Coast markets have outperformed the East. I expect that to probably be the case again next year, but as you look at your East Coast markets, supply does look to be dropping off some in D.C. and Boston in certain areas of the New York metro area. What markets or submarkets on the East Coast are you most excited about kind of qualitatively going into next year?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sean, you want to maybe take it?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Hey, Drew. This is Sean. I'd make a few comments as it relates to the East Coast and I think it ties in really with what Tim referenced earlier in terms of the difference between suburban and urban in that if you think across even the East Coast markets, maybe starting up in New England, and you talk about supply, we're in a lot of very protected suburban submarkets in the Boston region. And if you think about what's happening there, supply is certainly starting to moderate in the urban core, but you're talking north of 5% in 2015, close to 3% in 2016 as compared to the suburban submarkets in Boston, 1.5% sort of this year, next year. Feel pretty good about basically the suburban portfolio in Boston performing well.","New York, it probably depends on really where you are. In terms of our portfolio, we don't have a lot of stabilized assets in Manhattan but the supply protected pocket really for us is probably up at Morningside Heights. There's not much going on there. That property that we have there has performed well. Midtown West is getting a fair amount of supply, so some expectation for that to be a little bit soft. And then if you expand outside Manhattan into the Boroughs, we've get two large towers, Long Island City and Queens that pretty much the supply has been delivered there, performing well. Brooklyn is going to have some supplies. We probably need to be a little bit careful there. We have one deal delivering at this point, a little bit early, which is good but there's going to be more supply next year.","So in and around New York City, it sort of depends on where you are and as you get into the suburbs there's very little supply in the suburban towns and there's been great development activity for us there in terms of value creation opportunities from a development perspective.","In terms of the operating portfolio, as I mentioned earlier, as it relates to Connecticut, suburban New York is sort of the same in terms of slow and steady 3%, 4% kind of numbers probably in terms of rent change relative to being in Manhattan, it might be 6%. I referenced that earlier. So, certainly it depends on where you are but overall the suburban market should do fine.","As you come down to the Mid-Atlantic, it's really, again, a function of position in the portfolio but expecting supply next year to be about the same. The expectation for job growth is about the same as this year, but you have other effects that we've talked about in terms of unbundling and stuff that's supporting better revenue growth. But I still expect the D.C. metro market to be in a slow pace of recovery as compared to a spike recovery. I don't think anyone is expecting that in D.C. given the nature of the job environment here, what happens you're going to have churn obviously as you move forward into next year with an election year, but I don't think anyone is expecting the Mid-Atlantic to spike in any form or fashion. So hopefully that gives you a quick rundown on some of the East Coast markets.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That helps. Thank you very much.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","You got it.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Good afternoon. I was hoping if you guys could quantify the impact of property tax abatement burn-offs over the next couple of years?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Conor, I'll give it to you right now. It's running about 45 basis points in terms of impact on property tax year-over-year growth. And we haven't run all of our numbers for next year, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's in that relevant range.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay. So 45 basis points on total expense growth and \u2013 correct?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, 45 basis points of property tax growth.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay. Of property tax growth?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, yes.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then where did you guys add development rights this quarter, the three?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. Hi, Conor, it's Matt.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Hi.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Those were all actually in New England and they were all kind of infill suburban. Two of them were actually kind of in transit locations, all wood frame.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay. And then following up on that, Tim, you mentioned earlier that some markets are screening relatively unattractive for development. Could you identify those markets or maybe not sub-markets but more broadly?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're certainly more cautious in Northern California, Conor. Again, just given where a combination of land pricing, construction cost have been and then just aggressive behavior on the part of market participants and willing to take entitlement risk and where our view kind of risk and maybe long-term return have gotten out of sync and just sentiments gotten ahead of longer-term fundamentals.","You know it well, Northern California and Seattle, to a lesser extent, are much more volatile markets and you have to take that into account in terms of your investment and your development strategy in those markets.","It's been their history since \u2013 I don't know maybe since the gold rush in the 1850s and I'm not sure it's going to be a whole lot different when it's serving the part of the economy. It's kind of on the leading edge. It's always just going to be a little bit more volatile in terms of its underlying demand fundamental.","So Northern California probably more than any other, I'd say Seattle to a lesser extent but we think it's probably got a little bit more \u2013 a few more stabilizers in that market relative to its size. But it's prone to deeper cycles and certainly being very cautious about taking on any kind of new development risk, particularly if we can't get really a pure option on those opportunities.","So in Northern California the focus has really been in a couple places, really trying to intensify existing low density wood-frame assets where in some cases you really have jurisdictions that are willing to work with you just given kind of the housing shortage in that market and try to take advantage of that from a public sentiment standpoint to generate some entitlements that you may not be able to generate in other parts of the cycle when they're less friendly to development sponsors. But hopefully that gives you a sense. And I'd say, the New York, Manhattan, I'd say we're pretty \u2013 we're actually very cautious on right now just based upon supply and pricing, both land pricing and construction costs.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","That's helpful. Thank you. Then last question, as you guys look at the supply picture in your suburban markets, how do you factor in the impact from rehabs and redevelopments closing that spread between B and A?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In terms of...","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","I mean, would those serve as competition for you if we have rehabbers coming in and bringing things up closer to the rent levels where you guys are?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It depends on what you're talking about. I mean, people rehab assets at sort of all different tiers. So, people are making Cs, Bs and Bs, B+s that kind of thing. So we track it at the submarket level in terms of what's happening and the potential impact on our portfolio. We benchmark our performance quarterly compared to our competitors, using ICO (1:14:12) data and others. They'll have to take that into account in terms of what you expect them to produce. So it can create some competitive conversions, if you want to call it that, in certain submarkets, but it's really a sub market by sub market discussion.","And Conor, I don't think it's any different, whether it's urban or suburban. There's always going to be some percentage of the assets are going to go through development just like there's some assets that are really atrophying and kind of losing their competitive posture within the market. And a lot of it's going to depend on the business model. Ultimately the owner or the sponsor, in terms of whether they're in a position to \u2013 from both a financial capital and the human capital standpoint to invest capital at the right time to keep an asset competitive, at least within the segment they think is kind of optimally positioned. So it's going to be a mixed bag, but I don't think it's terribly different whether you're talking about suburban and urban.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Tim Naughton for any additional or closing comments.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Great.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","Your host for today's call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, please go ahead.","Jason Reilley - Senior Director of Investor Relations","Thank you, Craig, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities' fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call.","Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially.

The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q4 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin, and Matt Birenbaum. Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night, and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.","During our comments, we'll focus on providing a summary of Q4 and the full-year results and I'll spend a good part of time talking about the outlook for 2016. I'll talk about the economy, apartment markets, and operations. Then, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who'll talk about development as well as capital and risk management as we move further into the cycle.","So, let's start on slide four. Highlights for the quarter and year include Core FFO growth in Q4, 14.4% and 11.4% for the full-year, which is about 300 basis points higher than our original outlook at the beginning of the year. And, importantly, we continue to generate FFO growth this cycle for the top of the sector, while having the lowest leverage.","Q4 same-store revenue growth came in at 5.4% or 5.7%, when you include redevelopment as many of our peers do. And for the full-year, same-store revenue growth came in at 5.0% or 5.2%, including redevelopment. Same-store NOI for the year came in at 5.8%.","We completed about $500 million this quarter at right around a 7% yield, and $1.3 billion for the full-year at initial yield of 6.7%. We started another four communities totaling about $400 million in Q4, bringing our full-year level starts to roughly $1.2 billion or roughly in line with completions this year.","And lastly, we raised $400 million in new capital in the quarter, principally $200 million or $300 million unsecured debt offering. And for the year, we raised a total of $1.9 billion in capital to fund new investment and refinance maturing debt.","Turning now to slide five. The $1.3 billion of new development that we completed this year that I just referenced is contributing to healthy earnings and NAV accretion. Yields of 6.7% are roughly 250 basis points greater than our initial cost of external capital raised this year, and the cost base is, of these completions at $310,000 per unit is more than 30% less than the value of our average stabilized asset on a per unit basis, with rents at a 12% to 13% higher, implying that value creation was around 50% over cost. We're roughly $650 million in net NAV created or $5 per share in 2015 alone.","Turning to slide six, in addition to strong financial results, we excelled in other important aspects of our business in 2015, including: customer satisfaction, where we were ranked number one nationally, among all apartment operators for online reputation; associate engagement, where we're ranked number one in our sector and number two among all D.C. metro-based organizations on Glassdoor; corporate responsibility, where most of you are focused on sustainability, has put us towards the top of the sector in the U.S. and globally; and community recognition, where a number of our newly developed communities earn prestigious awards from various industry groups.","We probably don't talk enough about this with investors, but we know that achievement serving the needs of these important constituencies, I think our customers, our associates in the community as well as the shareholders, is critical to building the kind of culture and company that can be enduring and successful.","Shifting now to 2016, let's move to slide seven. We're projecting 9% core growth in Core FFO per share this year, driven by about two-thirds internal operations from the almost 6% same-store NOI growth that we're projecting at the midpoint, and about a third from new investment activity, once you net out the cost of new capital issuance, which is covered mostly from stabilizing new developments.","The principal difference in growth between 2015 and 2016 is that we expect less external growth from new investment activity, which in turn is being driven by the impact of fewer deliveries in 2015 that will be stabilizing in 2016 and some unevenness in the timing of capital raising activity.","When looking at the earnings impact of our development platform, it's probably more helpful to view it over a multiyear period. For example, if you look at it over the 2015-2016 timeframe here, a new investment activity net of changes in capital cost is projected to deliver approximately $0.70 per share to Core FFO or around 10% cumulative growth over the two-year period.","Moving to slide eight, given our outlook for 2016, we announced a dividend increase of 8% this year. The dividend is now up by more than 50% over the last five years; and importantly, has grown by 5.5% on a compounded basis over the last 20 years.","Our dividends are an important component of total return. They represent almost two-thirds of the total return of roughly 1800% that we've earned over the last 20 years and that kind of growth really does underscore the accretion and growth embedded in our business model. I think sometimes this gets a little lost during the market volatility and ramp in trading activity we're seeing in the sector today.","Turning to slide nine, our outlook has been driven in part by the prospect of a stable economy, continuing into 2016; and from our perspective appears to have reached mid cycle in terms of GDP and employment growth.","Improving consumer should benefit from stronger labor market in 2016. And then the public sector is expected to actually contribute to overall economic growth this year, although, it still have a lesser rates in the private sector after having been a drag for a number of years to overall economic growth.","Now, turning to slide 10, job growth in our markets is projected to outperform the U.S. again in 2016, as it did in 2015, it's just over 2%. The East Coast is expected to improve in 2016, while the tech-heavy West Coast market should moderate of the blistering pace over the last couple of years, although it's still remain at healthy levels around 2.5%.","On the slide 11, total personal income growth, which combines the job and per capita income growth is expected to accelerate in 2016 as wage growth gains traction, particularly for the younger millennial cohort, most of whom continue to rent. Our wage growth as we've discussed in the past, will become an ever increasing important driver of our business as economic cycle matures and more supply starts to come online in 2016.","Speaking to that, moving to slide 12, and supply, we do expect that completions in our markets will increase, in 2016 by about 50 basis points to around 2% of stock. But roughly in line job growth, suggesting pretty stable conditions overall.","Of course, some submarkets are particularly in urban cores, we'll see higher levels of deliveries that may impact local markets as owners use concessions to simulate absorption during lease-up. This is particularly true in urban and high rise product where inventories can build quickly as deliveries tend to occur over a more concentrated period of time.","But overall, housing demand should continue to favor the apartment sector due to many things that we've been talking about over the last couple of years, including favorable demographics, pent-up demand as millennials continue to unbundle, and ultimately changing lifestyle trends with delayed marriages and family formation. All these factors should help support another healthy year for apartment fundamentals in 2016.","And, turning to slide 13, that is reflected in our outlook for our same-store portfolio this year, where we're looking for same-store revenue growth of 4.25% and 5.5%. With modest improvement on the East Coast, on the West Coast we expect some moderation in Seattle and Northern California, after exceptionally strong growth in 2015.","Overall, then growth is expected to be healthy with performance between the East Coast and West Coast narrowing a bit in 2016.","And, with that, I'll turn it to Kevin who will discuss development and capital activity.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Tim. Turning to development activity on slide 14, we show development under construction in absolute terms and relative to our total enterprise value. So, projected for year-end 2016, and historically going back to 2004.","As you can see here ongoing development activity as a percentage of our total enterprise value has been relatively stable over the past few years at around 10%, which is at the low-end of our target range. This reflects our continued discipline in allocating capital to this activity as we move further into the cycle.","Moving to slide 15, profit margins on our development activity have remained remarkably resilient and healthy in this cycle. Thanks to the underlying strength of apartment fundamentals, our sector-leading development and construction capabilities, and, the decisions we've made about which opportunities to pursue as this cycle matures.","Since 2012, our development completions have increased from about a $0.5 billion to more than $1 billion. During that time, development yields have been around 7%, while corresponding cap rates for those particular assets have been at or below 5%, resulting in stable profit margins on development in the low 30% range.","As shown on slide 16, communities currently in lease-up continue to provide healthy profit margins. For the 12 communities undergoing initial lease-up in 4Q 2015, which represent $970 million in total capital costs, the current weighted average monthly rent for home is $115 above initial expectation. In terms of yield performance, the weighted average initial projected stabilized yield for these communities is currently 6.7% or 30 basis points higher than our original projection of 6.4%.","Turning to slide 17, I'd like to talk about how we manage risk associated with our development activity. The first way we do so is by maintaining a broadly diversified development pipeline, one that is diversified by geographic regions, by product type, and by exposure to urban and suburban submarkets.","As the charts on slide 17 illustrate, while our development pipeline remains diversified across regions, future development rights are biased toward infill suburban submarkets and mid-rise product, where rents, construction and land costs are more affordable, development economics are more favorable and the production cycle tends to be faster. Going forward, we expect our development rights pipeline will continue to be an important source of outsized growth in NAV and FFO per share.","Moving to slide 18, another way we manage development risk is how we source and structure new development opportunities. With the overwhelming majority being controlled through long-term purchase contracts with modest at-risk deposits and relatively few being controlled through land we've purchased and hold on our balance sheet.","At the end of 2015, our development rights pipeline consisted of 32 communities, representing $3.4 billion in projected total capital cost. Of these 32 communities, 25 communities are controlled through purchase contracts, while we own the land on the remaining seven communities. In addition of these seven communities, where we own the land, two account for approximately $420 million of the $485 million in land held for development on our balance sheet.","We expect to begin construction on these two development rights, Columbus Circle and Hollywood in 2016, which would reduce our projected land held for development by year-end 2016 to the lowest level in more than a decade. A third method, which we use to manage development risk is substantially match funding new starts with long-term capital. A topic we've talked about a lot in this cycle.","On slide 19, we highlight our funding position against the total projected capital cost of development underway. As you can see, we only need to source about $500 million in long-term capital against the $3.4 billion in development under construction or recently completed.","Taking new account to $2.2 billion of capital already spent to-date, $400 million of unrestricted cash on hand and $350 million of projected annual cash flow from operations after dividends. This means that about 85% of the value creation from ongoing development activity has already been locked in for our shareholders.","Turning to slide 20, we show how being substantially match-funded significantly enhances our growth in EBITDA, while simultaneously enhancing our already sector-leading credit profile, essentially making us similar to an acquisition-oriented REIT from a funding risk perspective, but with lower leverage and stronger built-in earnings growth.","Specifically, the projected EBITDA from recently completed development and from development under construction totals about $216 million, as shown on the chart in the left. This represents about 18% growth in annualized core EBITDA from the fourth quarter.","Even in a worse case, if all the $480 million in unfunded commitments were funded with new debt, our net debt to core EBITDA would still decline from 4.8 times to the mid-4s, after taking into account the EBITDA from new development.","Of course, our actual net debt to core EBITDA will move around a bit as we source new capital to fund incremental development activity, therefore the slide isn't meant to communicate that our leverage is going to decrease to 4.5 times or that our target leverage is 4.5 times. In fact, our target range for this metric is to be roughly between five times and six times.","Instead the purpose in showing this slide is to convey that due to match-funding strategy, we are optimally positioned to benefit from development activity, that is expected to be accretive both to earnings and balance sheet strength and that our credit profile is actually enhanced by our profitable development capabilities, given our funding strategy.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Tim.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kevin. And just ending here on slide 21, before opening up the call. In summary, 2015 was a very good year for the company and the industry. We're expecting 2016 to look a lot like 2015. Once again, benefiting from above-trend growth, I think this outlook is not surprising, just given our view that we are mid-cycle with healthy apartment, fundamentals continuing, and then just the stable level deliveries and healthy accretion are coming from our development pipeline.","As we move further into the mature portion of the economic expansion, we are highly focused on managing the investment and funding risk of the business. And as Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we're doing this through managing the size and diversity of our pipeline, reducing land inventory, and match-funding new commitments and maintaining leverage at the low-end of our target range.","And with that, Craig, we'd be happy to open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Perfect. First from UBS, we have Nick Yulico.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. So, I guess my first question would be, you've talked a lot about how you've been able to deliver projects at higher yields and underwriting for the past few years, you continue to do that. But as far as your guidance goes for this year, is your assumption for development pipeline that you're basically, you know, delivering at the yield that you give on the development page? And so that if you actually beat by 30 basis points at the high end of your range, or could you just put a little sensitivity around that?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Nick, this is Tim, and Matt, feel free to jump in. In terms of the attachment that shows the development pipeline with the projected yield of 6.3%, that is based upon current rents and rents marked to market once you start leasing and you get up to about 20%, 25% occupancy. For those communities that have started construction, where there may have been market rent growth, but we haven't yet started leasing, we haven't marked any of those to market, just to be clear.","And I think you can probably see, over the last few years, we've generally been beating the initial pro forma yields by 30 basis points, 50 basis points, or 60 basis points, just because of a strong market rent growth and the fact that we've been able to bring, deals in more or less at budgeted cost.","I think it really is ultimately, I mean if you look at the development pipeline today, the shadow pipeline of deals that haven't yet started, the economics of that look a lot like what the economics look like on the deals that we've been starting in the last couple of years.","So, I think a lot of it's going to \u2013 how you would underwrite those would depend upon, how you'd underwrite the markets ultimately in terms of where we're doing business and how you might underwrite construction cost relative to market rent growth change over the next couple of years.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","That's helpful. I guess, just related back to the guidance, should we be assuming that if you are getting the 30 basis points beating on original underwriting, is that already kind of factored into your midpoint of your guidance, or is that sort of get you to the higher end of your guidance range on FFO?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'm sorry. In terms of FFO, it reflects the \u2013 the budgets for each of those assets which \u2013 they would have some embedded level of market rent growth, commensurate with the markets in which they reside.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just one other question was on, you gave your outlook for U.S. job growth, basically being similar to last year. If job growth were to be slowing here, which people are concerned about, where do you think \u2013 which of your markets have the most risk then from a fundamental standpoint?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Nick, this is Sean. There's probably a couple of answers to that question, but I guess what I'd probably say based on historical precedent in the markets is the \u2013 the sort of high beta markets. If you want to think about it that way, it tend to be the technology markets. So, Northern California and Seattle tend to have a greater reaction in rent levels relative to a given change in job growth at many of our other markets.","So, the technology markets are the ones you probably would be most concerned about, that's assuming of course that any reduction in job growth is somewhat proportional. In the past, we've had some losses in the energy sector. It has not had a direct effect on our market, but there's certainly some indirect effects as it relates to a reduced amount of capital investment on behalf of those companies, it's going to ripple through the economies. So, those are the markets, I'd probably be most concerned about, given a reduction in job growth.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","I guess just one last quick question. And then maybe it's for Kevin, is that I think the concern would be that you guys \u2013 although you guys have a great balance sheet and you are mostly funded for the development pipeline today as you look at it year end, still starting more projects, and people then worried about you guys and having to raise capital a year from now. I mean, what would be your sort of answer to that, that shouldn't be a concern for folks?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Well, there's a few things, Nick. And first of all, as we demonstrate in 2009, if we don't think we have a reasonable access to capital, we don't have to start new project, that would be one thing to keep in mind. We don't need to keep creating commitments, if we don't think cost effective capital is available to us in one of our principle funding markets.","And I guess the second thing to keep in mind is that, if we do keep a very strong balance sheet both from a match-funding perspective, but also in other dimensions including having low leverage and ladder maturities. So, that we have an awful lot of flexibility to deal with sort of an air pocket that might exist where there may be disruption of the capital markets before we've been able to sort of adjust and dial back on new start.","So, I think fundamentally, we have a great deal of flexibility and the commitments we create in the capital, we're going to be able to source to deal with volatility and the capital markets and that's how we manage the balance sheet.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And next we have Nick Joseph from Citi.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. You talked about the development rights pipeline and its current focus on infill suburban submarkets. Do you think that there's a difference in investor demand in terms of the transaction market between urban core assets and infill suburban assets? And then how do you think about that in terms of the IRR differential between the two?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah, Nick this is Matt. There is great demand for almost everything right now. I think there is a difference in cap rate, clearly urban core assets do tend to trade at a lower cap rate. How much lower depends on what you're comparing it to, if you're comparing it to, here in D.C., D.C. versus Arlington is not going to be that different versus \u2013 as compared to say D.C. versus Tysons Corner for example. But, we do reflect that in the target yields that we put out for deals. We look out where we think the cap rate should be on those assets' specific sites today, and where we think long-term exit cap rates might be. So, we do factor that in.","Going forward, I don't know. It's speculative. There has been foreign capital that's probably preferred to stay mostly in the urban type of trophy assets, and that's one reason the cap rates are a little bit lower on those. But, we've got pretty strong healthy demand for both at this point.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Well, if we were to enter into a recession, do you think there's more stickiness to the urban core cap rates versus the suburban? Or do you think they would move up together?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","I don't know, I think every cycle is different, it's hard to know.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Nick, I guess, I think there is probably liquidity premium for the urban core stuffs. So, to the extent, you get into a period of more significant capital dislocation, the probability of being able to move or to monetize an urban asset, I would say, it's probably greater than a suburban asset or \u2013 and I think that's part of the premium valuation or discount cap. The discount for the cap rate is just that liquidity aspect of it.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And then in terms of rental affordability overall, are we at a point in the cycle where rental rate growth will more closely track wage growth, or is there still room to be able to increase rents at a higher pace than overall wage growth?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Nick, this is Sean. We are at sort of the upper-end range on that metric. It's running around 22%, which is within the band of history; but certainly, at the upper-end of that band. So, there's no question and we need to continue to see income growth to support rental rate growth in the future. So, we had a certain deceleration in income growth for whatever reason, which is not what's expected. And I think we're seeing that throughout the economy now, in terms of pressure on wage growth, then there would become greater constraints on pushing rents further in the future. No doubt about it.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Nick. And just to add to that. When you look at wage growth, we talked about in the past that there is a bifurcated labor market, right, in terms of college grads and non-college grads where you get 5% for the total population unemployment, 2.5% for college grads. The majority of our residents are college grads and I \u2013 and we are seeing that they're probably getting higher than average, making higher than average wage gains, which just provides a little bit more support I think for our business, in terms of \u2013 to continue to generate decent rent growth.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","And Nick, just to give you a sense. On a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, lease income for new residents relative to last year was more than 5%. So, we're seeing that for our population of residents for sure.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. Going back to your funding activities, can you talk about how you are thinking about asset sales versus capital markets today?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Gaurav, this is Kevin. As we laid out in our outlook, we anticipate sourcing about $1.1 million in asset sales and unsecured debt. I think in terms of the attractiveness of those markets today, both are highly attractive; and I'd say, while we don't comment on the precise mix in part, because the capital markets and sales can be volatile and the pricing can change over time. Of that $1.1 billion, the majority of the capital in our plan is contemplated to come in the form of unsecured debt issuance.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","So, not much asset sales this year?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Well, it's $1.1 million. We haven't again precisely identified the actual mix, a minority of that amount will come through asset sales, the majority will come through unsecured debt is our current capital plan. Tim, do you want to add?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Just I think to add to that, I think you are a limited somewhat and how much you could sell from a tax perspective and retain the capital without having to do a special dividend. Just because of the tax gains that are embedded and a lot of the assets that would be on our disposition list. So that would impact at the margins in terms of how you might think about debt versus asset sales.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","And the other points to bear in mind, is that with our leverage being a little bit, currently being a little bit below our target level we've got capacity for incremental debt, particularly out when you give effect to this deleveraging impact of stabilizing development.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And then lastly, on your development pipeline, the 6.3% average yield that you have on your current pipeline, is it possible to break it down between your expectations for the suburban versus urban assets?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","We haven't really broken it down that way. It really varies by market. I mean yields are lower in New York City, or cap rates are lower. So, maybe they are a little lower on the urban stuff. Again, we think cap rates are 25 basis points to 50 basis points lower on the existing assets. I don't know that the urban yields are that much lower, but they're probably a little bit lower.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. It's Austin Wurschmidt here. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned the average initial cost on the $1.9 billion in capital you raised last year was around 4.3%. What are you, I guess, assuming in your guidance in terms of that cost of capital in 2016?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Austin, that's probably a little bit more specific than we've ever guided to you before. So, I don't really have any comment on that.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So like maybe a little bit differently, when you think about the spread between the development deliveries and the cost of capital you plan to raise this year, would you think it would be something along the same lines as you achieved last year?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think probably in that ballpark. I don't know, Tim do you want to...","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, honestly \u2013 I mean we said we're primarily looking to rely on debt and asset sales. And we had two debt deals this past year that we could probably issue debt at about the same pricing today on a 10-year basis around in the mid-3% somewhere and cap rates in a range depending upon which market you're selling in, probably in the low-4%s to the mid-5%s. So, to the extent that we're more weighted towards leverage, which we're likely to be, this year. I think it gets you probably in the low-4%s, again like we were in 2015.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","That's fair. Thank you. And then just separately, given your guys' focus a little bit more on increasing your development exposure to suburban markets, and you've talked a lot about the growth in the 35 year old to 44 year old age cohort. Just curious about your thoughts given we've kind of seen that homeownership rate within that segment tick up here more recently, and how you're thinking about that in terms of renter demand moving forward.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","This is Matt. I guess I can speak to that on a little bit and then I don't know, Sean or Tim, you want to chime in as well. The demographic trends are long trends. I mean the great thing about is, you can see it coming five years, 10 years down the road. And so, as we think about how we want to position our portfolio where we are seeing the best risk-adjusted returns, opportunities to invest out of program communities for the future. It's driven by some of those big macro trends. So, I don't think a small movement in the home ownership rate on the margins is going to impact that when you look at just overall numbers coming through. It's a pretty dramatic shift that's going to occur here. So, I think things have to change a lot before it changes our opinion on that.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","And I guess the only thing to add is you really start to get the leading edge of that active boom in that. If you look back \u2013 a lot of people don't realize this but if you look back over the last five years to 10 years, the drop in home ownership rates are most pronounced in that 35 to 44 segment more so than the 25 to 34 segments. So, you have a lot more people moving into that segment. They drop by like 1,100 basis points, something like that.","And even if it ticks back up, I saw you're talking about lot more rental households over the next 10 years coming from that segment. And it's impacting how we're thinking about product right now in terms of providing \u2013 I think we've talked about the signature package in terms of a higher level of finish and some larger units than we've maybe been doing over the last few years, and certain deals in it, it impacts how you think about amenities as well. So, we do think it's going to be a pretty big source of demand and it represents that that extra core represents about 20% of our residents today, whereas the under 35 cohorts maybe 40%, 45%.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. There was a recent article that Facebook was offering employees $10,000 to $15,000 to move closer to its headquarters in Menlo Park. I'm wondering if you had heard other Silicon Valley companies doing this and if you've seen any impact in your properties?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","John, this is Sean. We're not specifically aware of a, like I saw, call it a global offering like Facebook made. Obviously, there are other companies out there recruiting people across America that provide incentives for them to relocate. So, we don't necessarily track that. It's very episodic in terms of how it occurs, it's just part of the normal fabric of the process on a daily basis. So, there's nothing material out there that we're aware of other than the recent Facebook offering and we're not hearing about it in a way that it's influencing our data in any form or fashion.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And it sounds like Northern California may decelerate in revenue growth this year. Can you comment on markets that you see may have the best chance of accelerating growth this year?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. Sean again. I guess, what I'd say is, at this point, you've properly identified Northern California is one of the markets, where there is probably a little bit of concern about slowing, just came up a couple of different times. But in terms of markets that have some upside, certainly the Mid-Atlantic is one that has some potential upside in terms of \u2013 we're at a point of cycle where we know that supply is about 2% last year. It's going to increase about 2.5% this year.","But more importantly, as we're getting pretty good job growth out of the Mid-Atlantic now, up and below 2% range. And it's starting to have a nice effect on occupancy and rent change across the markets here. So, the expectation is that there is potential for some upside in the Mid-Atlantic. I would now describe it as opportunistic and that there is significant upside. There's still a fair amount of supply coming and it's not a sort of high bid market as I described in the Northern California and Pacific Northwest region.","So, you tend to get a moderate recovery and we're seeing that here in terms of recent trends, where rent change is up about 100 basis points in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2014. So, there is nice momentum there.","And then the other market that may have some upside, I'd say is Boston. Boston has been performing well, job growth has been steady. And supply is projected to decrease this year relative to 2015. So, there is probably a little bit of potential upside in Boston and in the Mid-Atlantic are the two that probably stand out the most I'd say.","Southern California has been increasing nicely and we expect that to continue, but I wouldn't think it falls into the potential surprise category, like the others do.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks for that. And finally, on Edgewater, on your settlement in January, can you remind us what you plan to do with the proceeds? Are you planning to potentially redevelop the asset or just repay the mortgage?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","John, this is Kevin. The mortgage we repaid last year, we've already, as we've indicated in the release, received $44 million in proceeds that was back in 2015. We anticipate receiving another $29 million in final, additional proceeds in the first quarter. And so, part of that is meant to compensate for the lost income on the project. And so, essentially it becomes source of cash for us in 2016 and that's from a funding point of view how we view it.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","I'm sorry. John, I had just to add, this is Matt. We are planning to rebuild and we've been having conversations with the local jurisdiction there and are expecting to file rebuild plans shortly.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Looks like the settlement amount came in close to your last point of book value. I'm just wondering where you see it versus replacement cost?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Well. Maybe I should just correct you on the first piece. It \u2013 we wrote off the book value last year and even after having done so, the $44 million of proceeds that came in reflected. We had a causality gain. So, the proceeds receiving last year exceeded our remaining book value in the destroyed building. As I indicated a significant portion of the proceeds about $20 million relates to compensation for lost income due to the business interruption of losing the building. So, that's one little point of clarification.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. In terms of the cost to rebuild, I don't think we know yet exactly what's going to cost to rebuild. We have to finish the plans and bid it out, but relative to the overall recovery, it would certainly be less, right?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And overall we received $73 million and about a little more than $50 million that's related to destroyed building and our sense is that, that was meant to cover the replacement costs for that building.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. I was looking at the replacement on the book value in your 2013 10-K. Thank you.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","That's probably also included the other building that was not destroyed.","Operator","And next we'll move to Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. You mentioned rent as a percent of income is kind of at the upper end of historical ranges. Any submarkets where you're above the prior peaks and how do you think about maybe millennial budgets where they might not have a car?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Jana. Good question. In terms of markets where it's, I guess constrained, it's not necessarily any one market that's well beyond historical ranges. You've got certain markets that are more expensive, but obviously you got people making substantially more income. So, there is nothing that's on the extreme outlier side, if you want to call it that.","Anyhow, we do try to take into account millennials and the choices they make, so those numbers tend to be higher in some of those urban locations where people don't have cars, using metro or the subway, or whatever it might be. So, we do find that in those cases, people are in a position where they can tend to spend a little bit more of their income on rent in other geographies, so it's a fair point.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then maybe just on your outlook for your Metro New York, New Jersey portfolio, can you maybe talk to the different submarkets, as certain submarkets are seeing much more supply than others?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. In terms of the Greater New York, New Jersey market, I mean if you look at it across say New York City, Northern New Jersey, Central New Jersey, Long Island, Westchester, it's a pretty diverse geography. A lot of the supply is concentrated in New York City and Northern New Jersey.","So, if you're looking at Hudson County and then you spread throughout the boroughs, you're going to see that. Supply as a percent of inventory still on Westchester, Long Island, Central New Jersey is pretty insignificant. So even though you have demand in those markets that identify with greater supply, there's a lid on growth next year as a result of it. So, there's not a wide variation. For the most part, New York-New Jersey is going to be probably in the mid-to-high 3% range. There is not one market that's in the low-2%s and other one in the 5%s, to give you some perspective if that helps. It's a pretty tight range.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Next from Janney, we have Rob Stevenson.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Sean can you do more or less the same for the D.C. submarkets, in terms of fourth quarter performance, was there any bifurcation by sort of submarket in the D.C. Metro? And then in terms of your 2016 outlook, any material differential in expectations between D.C. proper, Northern Virginia, et cetera?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. As it relates to the \u2013 I'll call it sort of recent momentum including the fourth quarter and spillover into early 2016, I'd say the laggard across the Metro area has been suburban Maryland. Job growth has been okay, but the supply has been heavy and steady throughout that region, particularly Rockville, North Bethesda, Chevy Chase has been inundated with supply. So it's been the softest.","The strongest has been in and around D.C. So, D.C. proper as well as the close-in sort of RB (42:50) corridor and things like that, towns and submarkets that are close in to D.C. And then I'd say the rest of Northern Virginia kind of falls into second place. So, call it, the district and immediately adjacent submarkets, Northern Virginia and then suburban Maryland being the laggard as kind of recent conditions.","In terms of expected performance in 2016, what we have is overall for the Mid-Atlantic, probably be in the mid 1% range. And again, it's relatively tight I'd say, when we're talking about suburban Maryland probably, right at the midpoint there. We may see a little bit better performance out of D.C., just given the nature of our specific assets in D.C., which is the Gallery Place, Foxhall, stuff in the Northwest Corridor that's older and rent controlled.","When you look at it from a market perspective, I would say that one thing to be cautious about is, the greatest amount of supply to be delivered in 2016 is in the district, because depending on the distribution of your portfolio within the district really will dictate what's your performance is going to be.","So, the way I think the market would probably look at it is, D.C. people would probably expect to be a little bit softer, given the nature of the deliveries. Infill suburban submarkets probably perform \u2013 in Virginia performing better. And then, western Fairfax, I would say and suburban Maryland probably be in the laggard.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And then, can you also talk about expectations for the three main Southern California submarkets in 2016 and how you see that sort of shaping up and, any type of issues in any of the individual markets that you're worried about from a supply standpoint?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure, happy to talk about that. In terms of \u2013 again, recent performance rolling forward, I'll try to keep it relatively brief without going on too long here. But, where we've started to see some supply impacts is in Orange County. Orange County softened up a little bit. There is a fair amount of supply coming into Irvine, there's some in Laguna Hills, there's supply in Anaheim, there's been supply in Huntington Beach, a little bit in Costa Mesa, so that's softened a little bit. And our expectation for 2016 for that market is for it to trail the other regions as well because of the same issues.","San Diego and L.A., we expect the lead going into 2016 and continue throughout the year. And for the most part, that's not only the nature of the market, but how our portfolio is positioned, which is for the most part it's the asset in suburban submarkets across San Diego, which is relatively small portfolio, but that's where the majority of our assets are located.","And Los Angeles, same thing in terms of the distribution of the assets within those submarkets. We don't have any same-store assets in Downtown L.A., as an example, which is getting supply now that's equal to double-digit percentages of existing inventory. So, you're going to have softness in some of those submarkets like Downtown L.A., where you're getting a heavy amount of new deliveries.","So, I'd say for 2016 overall, if I'm going to see L.A.-San Diego leading and Orange County lagging, just given the nature of our portfolio, but also just from the market perspective in terms of where the supply is concentrated.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Next up we have Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. This is Chris for Ian. Obviously, you don't do a lot of acquisitions. Can you talk a little bit about the motivated you to do the Avalon-Hoboken and then what's the forward cap rate on that asset?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Sure. Chris, this is Matt. You're right, we haven't done a lot of acquisitions historically in this cycle. So, at this point, what we are doing is we are trying to \u2013 we're always looking for opportunities to improve our portfolio where we can.","And, that happens to be a very unique opportunity there in Hoboken. We weren't per se looking to add in New Jersey on a net basis. But, we're always looking to improve our submarket exposure. It's a highly supply protected submarket. So, one of the few parts of New Jersey, we have not been able to penetrate through new development. The cap rate is about 5%, which is pretty attractive for an asset. It's only seven years old.","The average unit size there is about 1,000 square feet, so it's actually more targeted at families and necessarily at young singles. And that's what \u2013 in that part of Hoboken, it's kind of interesting to see how it's evolving in that way as Hoboken kind of matures as a desirable location, not just for people kind of right out of school, but for people; married couples, who're a little bit older as well, there's a super market right next door. So, it was just a unique opportunity and we feel like we're able to, based on some unique characteristics of the way the asset was marketed, get it at price it was more compelling than most of the acquisition opportunities we're seeing.","Unknown Speaker","Great.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, maybe just to add to that, maybe implicit in your question too. I mean we're not looking at acquisitions as a growth platform right now to be clear. But, we are seeing a lot of volume and we see it as an opportunity to potentially upgrade the portfolio. And so we do look at sort of mid cycle. We see a lot of volume. We're focused both on asset management and portfolio management to try to upgrade and improve the portfolio as we can.","And as I mentioned earlier in one of the other questions, that we are somewhat limited in terms of how much dispositions we can do before, you can't retain the capital anymore, but we do see that as \u2013 we do have some assets we like to sell and we're seeing an active transaction market, where we see assets, we preferred our own and so we're trying to do some fair trade along the way as well.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. That's helpful. Then the 5% is how much CapEx per units does that have in there?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, normally when we quote cap rates, it's just kind of typical market convention. So, I don't know the exact number; but this is again a fairly young asset. So, my guess is something like, 400 units or 500 units something like that.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. And then, I appreciate all the color on the risk mitigation (49:13) you guys do on the development pipeline, but just wondering if you can give us some perspective of where cap rate spreads were on new starts before the market entered a downturn last time around? And then, where those spreads ended up, and then I guess at the 250 basis point cap rates spread you've got now, is that enough cushion to kind of stay profitable as things turn?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. This is Tim. I would say, we're probably looking at development yields around, what we're looking at today mid-6%s. There was a year or two where it ended up, they came in around closer to 5% in terms of actual performance.","Conversely, I would say, cap rates will probably in the mid-4%s, where they are today and that really, as you know, there are hardly any trades at all; but to the extent there were trades, it probably went north of \u2013 it probably went north of 6% for a year or two. But hopefully that's help \u2013 but if you look at the deal that we were building in 2009 and 2010 that ended up stabilizing initially at 5%, those are more or like 6.5% and 7%s today, just to put it in perspective.","So, they are fine assets. We're not going to make the same kind of return that was made on deals that we started two years later, for sure. But still find outcome, given the kind of recession we went through.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Chris, this is Kevin. Just to add to that, looking at some of the data that we have here internally in terms of original projected yields and initial stabilized yields by vintage of completion. And going back to that time period, yields fell about 100 basis points. So, that's their initial underwriting.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And, that's a great point, Matt's alluding to, the match-funding is what's the most critical thing because comparing sort of, you had to really compare the yields on the deals that have started with the capital that is sourced in the same period of time. That's the virtue of match-funding, you walk into NAV growth right now at this point in time.","Unknown Speaker","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from Ryan Peterson with Sandler O'Neill.","Ryan Peterson - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Hi, thank you. Just on your Columbus Circle development, could you guys provide an update on any plans to monetize a portion of that through either retail or condominiums?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Sure. This is Matt, I can speak to that a little bit. We are working on it. The program is getting set. As an example, I think when we first bought the land, we thought we were going to do about 50,000 square feet or 55,000 square feet of retail there. The programs that we have now is more or like 67,000 square feet or 70,000 square feet of retail. We were able to add some retail in a seller level and a sub-seller level. So, it's now matured to the point that we have a pretty good definition of what the offering is and we have been talking to folks and we'll keep you updated as we make progress on that.","Ryan Peterson - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Great. And then my second question is just, what your thoughts are on 421-A, whether that will be resuscitated or whether you think that will kind of severely curb development in New York?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I think it's obviously too early to tell. It is a program that's been around for a long, long time. And it is important for to make rental production work for the most part in the city, in New York City. So, I think our local folks would say, probably there will be a program in some form of fashion. It will come back at some point. These things get snagged in politics and in New York, there's kind of this unique situation, right. It's not just the city, but all the new \u2013 the state legislators involved as well.","So, as it relates to our portfolio specifically, it doesn't really have much impact, the deal we're just talking about Columbus Circle, we're never intending to put that deal in the program. So, our plan is not to have any affordables and not to have any tax abatements from the start. And, the other deals that we have done in New York, it's already been vested. So, it might impact the land market until things settle out, but it's too early to say what this impact might be going forward.","Ryan Peterson - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Great. That's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Next from Zelman & Associates, we have Dan Oppenheim.","Dan M. Oppenheim - Zelman & Associates","Thanks. I was wondering just if you can talk a little bit in terms of what you're thinking about for, you said you'll start Columbus Circle here in 2016, any thought in terms of timing for that, or just finalizing in terms of the retail offering and overall plans?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Our current expectation is we've started in the second half of the year. I think we're starting demolition right now. So, we've got some work to do there. And, we're just finalizing the plans, but it's in the plan for the back half of the year.","Dan M. Oppenheim - Zelman & Associates","Got it. And then, I guess relatedly, on page five of the slide, you talked to basically show the, where you're getting in terms of the rent and the capital costs for the development projects that were completed in 2015, basically showing some of the, call it, higher gross yield relative to the stabilized portfolio. How do you think about that in terms of the growth rate? I mentioned Columbus Circle, look at that a couple years from now, almost going to look the reverse in terms of lower yield, but likely thinking about a higher long-term growth rate, and so wondering how you think about the growth on this or what you've started in 2015?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Dan, it's Tim. I mean in terms of \u2013 we've talked to this in the past, every deal has a target yield that's impacted by what we think the projected growth profile, cash growth profile. That asset will or that submarket will deliver, so something like a Columbus Circle, we think we'd have a higher growth profile than the average field in our \u2013 our portfolio.","We would expect that to have a lower go-in yield and that's pretty much how land markets and development markets price. So, it's a fair point because we do have a couple large deals that the \u2013 and Hollywood deal as well, which is an L.A. deal which \u2013 usually California deals are lower cap rate and higher growth. So that will impact the projected initial yield, if you will, because we are expecting to get, basically the same IRR but more of it through residual and cash flow growth.","Dan M. Oppenheim - Zelman & Associates","Okay. Thank you.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon everyone. I just wanted to go back to some of your job growth outlook, especially the New York, Metro New Jersey area, just hearing some other forecasts calling for some deceleration there. Looks like you're looking for things to pick up in 2016 versus 2015. I was just curious if you could comment on what's driving that, if it's really your expectations in New York City or if it's some of the suburbs?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we really rely on third parties for our job forecast. I guess I would start there. There is some chat, I think partly what's been going on in the equity markets whether some of the economists and consensus is going to drift down a little bit, in terms of GDP and job forecast in general to the extent that it, they changed it related to the equity markets.","I guess it would be logical that maybe New York, New Jersey might be more impacted than the average market. But now, we used some judgment, but when we're quoting job growth, we are relying on third parties that we have found to be most helpful in the past.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. And just one other question, just in terms of L.A., it sounds like expectations for Southern California overall are going to be for continued acceleration, but it did seem like same-store revenue growth here in L.A. slowed a little bit, and I was just wondering if there was something specifically that kind of weighed on growth here this quarter, understanding it's still 6%, which is good, but...","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, this is Sean. There's nothing specific that we're concerned about as it relates to L.A. I mean every asset has different characteristics in terms of lease expiration profile and things of that sort. You're trying to push rate in some cases and then in other cases, trying to gain occupancy. So, you just kind of get in the quarter-to-quarter noise and I don't think there's any concern about L.A. at this point at all.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next we'll go to Dave Bragg from Green Street Advisors.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon. I had a couple of quick ones for you. The track record of the cycle on development is clearly compelling, as you laid out on 2015. Thinking about it from the profit margin perspective that you laid out, what level of profit margins are you targeting on incremental starts?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Dave, as we mentioned, we typically do start with the cost of capital and add some accretion factor to that. I mean it ends up being in the 150 basis point to 200 basis point range in terms of premium from a target perspective.","And we've been able to meet or exceed that certainly the cycle. We put the slide up there that showed the \u2013 with the average deal was crossing about $310,000 just using your data, if you just sort of extrapolate that out, using the rent premium that those deals are getting, they would suggest an average value about $470,000 for that book of business.","And if you look at the pipeline, the shadow pipeline that has an estimated cost about $350 a door today with honestly a bit more urban-oriented product, with probably has a little bit higher rents on average, slightly higher rent. So, it's still pretty healthy looking margin based upon what we know today which are today's rents and today's cost.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And, Tim, you've mentioned a couple of times, or you've alluded to a limit surrounding your disposition potential in 2016. Could you put a number around that?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it depends which assets you choose to sell at the end of the day, but it's not atypical. It's probably, the assets we're looking to sell have more than a 50% embedded gain on the proceeds. So to the extent, you've got, call it $200 million or $300 million of capacity before you start getting into requirement just to distribute, you could sell 2x there, but it depends on the mix. And I don't know if you've got anything you want to add to that?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Just a couple of things in that. Probably tax is not an area people are overly eager to get into a deep discussion on to be sure. There's really two issues, one is just the special dividend obligation associated with the fact that we are a tax paying entity, but for the fact that we have the dividends paid deduction. But there's also excise considerations as well.","So, I think from our standpoint, when we look at using asset sales to fund development, we have a fair bit of running room in terms of being able to sell assets. Before we had to worry about a special dividend obligation, we would probably more likely encounter situation where we might have to pay an excise tax, which is sort of a little bit of a 4% tax payment on excess income over distributions.","And so, it becomes sort of kind of almost like a transaction cost, if you will. That get added to selling assets to fund development. So we certainly have a reasonable amount of ability to continue to sell assets to fund development, but what we'd run into first is probably haven't pay an excise tax, which is just an extra transaction cost, if you will, which we'd rather not incur, if we can avoid it, but it's something that's probably more relevant.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","All right. Thank you for that. One last one for you, Kevin. You suggested that you'll lean on unsecured market as it relates to the sources of funds. What are your latest thoughts on 30-year money?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Well, we don't really have 30-year unsecured money in the balance sheet today. We do have fair bit of about $1.1 billion of tax exempt debt, that's secured in and has probably on average about 21-years left to run. So, that's something we have done in the past and we like that form capital, though it's far or less available today.","In terms of 30-year unsecured debt, since we don't currently have it. You have to ask yourself what's it in substitution for. I think probably it's been a little bit more of a compelling equity substitute for those who want more leverage than a compelling substitute for 10-year debt when you do the breakevens.","For us, we might be willing to entertain doing it. I guess probably, one guiding principle would be, if we will look at the total amount of debt, we're going to issuing in one year, there's only so much we want to issue in the form of 10-year unsecured debt before.","In the future period, we would have more debt coming due than we prefer, which \u2013 as we talked about before, we try to target having level maturities that are on balance less than or equal to our projected amount of dividend.","And so, if we felt we're going to be issuing a certain amount of debt in the unsecured markets. In a given year that might be more than we want to have come in due in 10 years. We might think about doing the excess in the form of a 30-year note offering.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And next from Jefferies, we have Tayo Okusanya.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Yes, good afternoon. I was just curious, just given all the market volatility concerns about a recession, are you seeing your tenants reacting any differently when you gave them new acting rents in January? And when renewals were coming up, whether they are being much more, you know, aggressive about trying to get a rent cut or decline or some type of relief, just kind of given the overall nervousness in the economic backdrop?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Tayo, it's Sean. I mean to answer that directly based on the data, the answer is no, in terms of the actions they're taking. For example, rent increase is too high and move out to rent increase doesn't really move that much on average, it has the certain markets.","And so I think you probably have to go market-by-market to figure out where that's most pronounced. So there's certainly been pushback in Northern California, that's above historical averages. But that's the market where we've seen pretty significant rent growth in the last three years, so you sort of expect that when someone get to a third, 8%, 9%, 10% rent increase, wages have been growing, but they are not growing that quickly, there's some pushback, but I'd say it's part of the normal process. There's not as significant shift to one direction or another that we're seeing across the portfolio.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And from Robert W. Baird, we have Drew Babin.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. I was hoping you could talk about a couple of your larger developments out there, the Willoughby Square, AVA DoBro asset and North Station in Boston? And where those yield expectations stack up kind of relative to that 6.3% and what gives you confidence for those assets in particular that, you know, targeted yields will be achieved either from a cost control standpoint or market fundamentals?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Sure. Drew, this is Matt. I can start on that and Sean, if you want to chime in anything. Those are two big urban high rises and again, we think about the target returns starting out relative to kind of what the spot cap rate is \u2013 would be on those assets is one thing we look at as well as objective growth profile would be, to kind of get from different potential starting target yields to target IRR, which is more similar across different deals.","Those two deals were underwritten in kind of the high fives based on the rents that we're in place when we started those deals. We have not marked either one to market yet. The Willoughby Square deal is a very large building. So, it will be a while before we have kind of 20% lease, which is typically when we would market-to-market. But I think we're feeling pretty good about the capital budget there and we're feeling pretty good that based on what we've seen so far, the market is certainly a little bit above where it was pro forma and Sean...","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Drew, this is Sean. As it relates to Willoughby\/AVA DoBro, which is really \u2013 as you may not know, it's two components to the building as an AVA component and then Avalon component. We have product in the AVA section of the building right now, which delivered late in the fourth quarter after a few delays with the MTA in their space. But early returns are good. We haven't marked it to market, but face rents are in the $60 a foot range.","So, I think pro forma was around $55, and at $60 a foot that's a kind of slow leasing season, Christmas, January kind of rates. So feel pretty good about that in terms of how that product is positioned in Brooklyn. As I mentioned, we don't have the Avalon component yet, but it's \u2013 those would be the nicer units at top of the building. So, our expectation is once we open those up probably mid-year, we're going to see a nice pop in overall rates for the building.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Drew, this is Tim. And just to add maybe on the cost (01:07:29). So we feel pretty good about the cost. I mean we do access our own GC, sometimes with the CM, construction management firm, but we hold the contracts.","And so, we typically have better visibility than if we are working with a third party in terms of any cost pressures on deals. And we feel pretty good about \u2013 as Matt mentioned, \u2013 we feel pretty good about these deals right now in terms of bringing those online in the \u2013 for the budget amounts that we've laid out on our schedule.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. That's helpful. One more. Should there be any slowing in employment growth in the Bay area, how do you feel that the San Francisco MSA kind of stacks up against Silicon Valley against the East Bay area, either from a supply standpoint or just \u2013 what are the dynamics on the ground in terms of setup if things get slowed down?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, sure. Drew, it's Sean. Couple of thoughts on that, I mean in general across that market, when things soften up, the most expensive price point product tends to suffer first. So, if you had the most expensive high rises in the city, you're going to see some reaction to that. If you \u2013 that's just a macro comment. It sort of depends on when it occurs, and what supply is being delivered.","As we go into 2016, there is more supply concentrated in San Jose than there is in either the East Bay or San Francisco, as an example, that's across San Jose, now it's concentrated in Northeast San Jose. If you play that up in the Mountain View, certain submarkets is about three or four submarkets there. It's up in San Francisco, there's fair amount of supply being delivered into Soma.","So, if you're exposed to Soma, you're probably going to get hurt just as much. So, it sort of depends on when in the cycle that occurs and what supply is being delivered at that point in time. But generally speaking in the higher price point assets tend to suffer first. And what you tend to see is, people will migrate as things become more affordable, they'll migrate back towards into the city and the cycle kind of repeats itself. So hopefully, that provides some broad perspective about what happens in the market.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's helpful. Thank you. That's all I got.","Operator","And next, we have Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Richard Charles Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thanks. Sorry to keep it going here. But I had a question, looking at the development pipeline, do you develop eaves product? Are they all kind of retrofit from current assets?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah, Rich. This is Matt. I wish we could, but those are all renovations or...","Richard Charles Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Okay. So that's \u2013 I get it. I thought so, because there's none listed there. And that's my recollection. But then I noticed that you also have been selling some of these product. I'm just curious how that brand is doing relative to AVA.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Rich, it's Sean. One way to think about it is just how the portfolio eaves communities are performing relative to Avalon or AVA, that's typically a story of which market is actually in, if it's in Northern California, obviously it's been very strong versus say, Westchester.","But generally speaking right now within the market footprint, our eaves communities are pretty synonymous with B communities, as you refer to Axium metrics or Reese (01:10:47) or any of those. And eaves communities tend to be outperforming right now. To give you some perspective in the fourth quarter for our portfolio, the B assets or the eaves assets, which is for the most part of B assets, were about 70 basis points ahead of how the A assets were performing.","As you look at Axium metrics, this is a pretty similar pattern there in terms of the outperformance. So this part of the cycle well positioned value-oriented communities are outperforming. To the extent, we're selling one of those communities. This typically is related to either submarket specific or asset specific either issues we have or concerns about concentration in terms of other activity, we might have in the region that typically drives those disposition decisions as it relates to, pretty much any community, but eaves as well.","Richard Charles Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And then bigger picture on the development pipeline, in light of the fact that you're projecting your land position to decline in 2016, 26 projects under development, about 10% of your asset base is tied up in development. If you were to kind of roll forward three years or four years from now, would those numbers be materially lower than they are today, if you had to hazard a guess?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Rich, this is Tim. I guess they'll be lower. How materially, it really kind of depends a bit on the opportunity set. We've been a little surprised honestly over the last let's say year and year-and-half, but we continue to see, we think are pretty compelling opportunities at reasonable land prices.","So to the extent that things get \u2013 start getting too expensive or too distorted which they have on a limited basis for instance in the Bay Area, we're \u2013 it's tough to make the numbers work in the Bay Area. So all the markets start to looking like the Bay area, we would deplete the development rights inventory pretty quickly. But that's something I guess, I mean typically the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic could be a little bit more stable, and I would expect \u2013 the expected case would be, it would start to draw down a bit over the next three years.","Richard Charles Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay, Great. Thank you.","Operator","And gentlemen, your final question of the day comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Guys, it's actually Neil on for Wes. Just a question on occupancy. It looked like this quarter you saw pretty strong drop in occupancy across the board, particularly in Northern California. Just wondering if you can comment on that. Was it a function of just seasonally weak or lower leasing, a function of you switching your expiration to the middle, higher volume, higher velocity times of the year, pushing rent too hard? Can you comment on that?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure, Neil. This is Sean. One thing to keep in mind is our occupancy was down on a year-over-year basis. If you look at it on a sequential basis, we were actually up 20 basis points, and there were a couple of markets at the end of 2014, particularly Northern California and the Greater New York region, where frankly availability was a little lower than we had wanted it from an ideal perspective in terms of pushing pricing and occupancy drifted up a little heavy.","So we're not too concerned about the year-over-year change, sequential change, we're perfectly fine with. We're well-positioned today in terms of where we sit, we are basically mid-95%s, in terms of economic occupancy it's down about 30 basis points, 40 basis points. But it's right about where we think we should be.","As we look toward to the spring, we want to try and put pricing as much as we can and availability is in the mid-5% range, it's up 30 bps, 40 bps from last year at this point in time. But, as I mentioned, we thought we were probably a little bit on the low side at this point last year. So, we think we're in a pretty good shape and here just looking at a year-over-year comp that's creating that change in occupancy.","Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, are you seeing any evidence that in the Bay area for some of your rentals on the higher end that people maybe are pushing back or maybe seeing some softness in renewals or new leases, that would lead you to indicate that there may be something more than a temporary blip going on in that market?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Good question. I mean obviously Q4 is typically is a slower period, I would say it was a little beyond seasonal adjustment in the fourth quarter, whether it continues to soften a bit, just to be seen. But, I think as we indicated earlier, we're expecting chart growth to slow in that region, deliveries will be accelerating in that market.","So, we are expecting it to soften a bit as we move throughout the year, whether that for a sign of it in the fourth quarter not just to be seen. But, we did expect some softening, we realize that and the question going forward here is, what's the basis job growth since we know what supply is going to be. So, our expectation is that market will moderate through 2016, given just the fundamentals that are in place.","Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Fair enough. Thank you very much for taking the time.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah.","Operator","And, with no more questions, I'd like to turn things back to Tim Naughton for any closing remarks.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Craig. I know people are busy, given the time of the year. I just want to thank you all for being on today.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Senior Director of Investor Relations.

There are a variety of risk and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially.

Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Jason. And welcome to our third quarter call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I will be providing management commentary on the slides that we posted yesterday after the market closed, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.","My comments will focus on providing a summary of Q3 and year-to-date results, our outlook for 2016, a look at fundamentals and lastly an update on investment activity and a look back on our capital allocation track record.","So let's start on slide 4. It was a solid quarter where we achieved core FFO growth of 7.3% from a combination of same store NOI growth of over 4% and healthy contributions continuing from new lease ups.","Year-to-date, core FFO per share is up over 9%. And in Q3, we raised over $1 billion in new capital including the October bond deal and disposition activity to fund ongoing and the upcoming development and to pay off maturing debt.","Turning to slide 5 and our updated outlook for the year. We've updated our outlook for FFO and same-store metrics. Core FFO per share has been reduced by $0.05 per share or 70 basis points for the full year to 8.3% due to a combination of factors including same-store revenue growth being trimmed by around 12 basis points from our midyear forecast from a mix of lower projected occupancy and rate for Q4.","Secondly, higher same-store operating expenses related primarily to higher utility costs and delayed resolution of several tax appeals. Thirdly, lower redevelopment NOI and lastly higher interest rate \u2013 a higher interest related cost in connection with our recent $650 million bond deal that we completed earlier this month.","Turning now to slide 6. We thought we'd spend a couple of minutes on fundamentals that are shaping portfolio performance and the overall outlook for the apartment sector. GDP and job growth, as many of you know, continue to decelerate. GDP growth has been below 1.5% now for the last three quarters, while job growth is running more than 20% less than its cyclical peak, and well off last year's pace so far year-to-date. Lower corporate profits and business confidence is resulting in less investment in labor and capital, as businesses appear reluctant to make new commitments.","Turning to slide 7, while businesses are slowing down, the consumer appears to still be in good shape. The labor market continues to tighten with more job openings helping to contribute to an improved wage picture.","Consumers' balance sheets are in the best shape in many years. And these trends are contributing to cyclically high consumer confidence, which in turn is helping to drive stronger household formation, which is running north of a million per year, after lingering at generational lows earlier this cycle.","Turning to slide 8, longer term secular trends should continue to support apartment demand. Young adult job growth is outpacing the U.S. average, driven obviously by strong growth in this age cohort. This generation is marrying and having children later, and unsurprisingly, we have seen the strongest household formation for singles and couples, as one- and two-person households have been responsible for more than 80% of all net new households formed so far this cycle.","Home ownership rates have in turn continued to fall through this segment, helping to stimulate healthy apartment demand this cycle. While the leading edge of millennials are now in their mid-30s, the largest part of this generation are still in their mid-20s and are expected to stimulate rental demand for several years. So overall, despite slower economic activity, demand fundamentals are still healthy for the housing market in general and for the apartment sector, specifically.","Turning to slide 9. Let's take a look at what these trends mean for our markets. So far, this cycle from 2010 to 2015, we benefited from a significant imbalance between demand and supply. This slide looks at this in a couple of ways. On the left, we look at the broader housing picture as household formation significantly outpaced housing starts during this period. And on the right, job growth outpaced new apartment deliveries by roughly 2 times. So, in the first part of the cycle through 2015, demand has run well above supply and apartment rates have grown well above the long-term trend.","Going forward over the next two to three years, you can see from the right-hand side of both those charts, through 2018, we expect demand and supply to be more in balance, reflecting an industry moving toward equilibrium after years of significant outperformance.","Turning to slide 10. That notion is certainly reflected in recent rent performance across our markets and in our same store portfolio. Overall, market rent growth according to Axiometrics has declined from around 5% to 2% to 3% over the last four to five quarters. Similarly, in our same-store portfolio, we're seeing same unit rent growth decline from over 6% to 3% to 4% range during that same time or to levels that are closer to historical average.","Turning to slide 11 and double clicking through on our portfolio bit here, we can see a couple of other trends. First, we are seeing convergence in performance between east and west as differentials in rent growth have narrowed by around 300 basis points over the last year, driven mainly by deceleration in Northern California and some improvement in the Mid-Atlantic. And second, and as we've been discussing in recent quarters, rent growth in the suburbs continues to outpace that in urban submarkets by around 200 basis points, given this concentration of new supply in urban centers.","Let's turn now to investment activity onto slide 12. Lease up performance continues to be strong as rents are roughly 200 basis points above pro forma and yields are 30 basis points higher. And with yields well-above prevailing cap rates and our marginal cost of capital, redevelopment is contributing meaningfully to NAV and earnings growth well into the current cycle.","Turning to slide 13 and as discussed a couple of quarters ago this really has been the case during our life as a public company. This slide depicts development performance across various phases of the cycle since 1995. The strongest performance generally occurs during the expansion phase for sure, but it's been healthy even when new development has delivered into the downturn. We believe this speaks to our capability in this area and our disciplined approach to allocating capital to this activity.","Turning now to slide 14. In addition, we continue to be disciplined in how we capitalize new development commitments. Excluding the benefit of any free cash flow or retained earnings we may enjoy, we're still currently 85% match funded against our $3.1 billion pipeline. That is we've already raised most of the permanent capital for this bucket of assets well in advance of it producing operating cash flow. So, as this development stabilizes, it will add meaningfully to future growth in free cash flow.","Turning to the slide 15 and shifting gears a bit, we thought it might be helpful to briefly review our capital allocation track record over our life as a public company. While we understand that there's a lot of focus right now on moderating fundamentals, and the impact on portfolio performance. We are investing in long-lived assets with an aim to deliver outsized total returns over the long run.","As you can see on this chart, over the last 20 plus years, we've been able to generate strong investment returns with unlevered IRRs of around 13%. A few points worth noting here. First, we've been able to deliver healthy returns, double-digit IRRs across all of our regions. Second, we generated strong IRRs across both urban and the suburban submarkets. Third, we generated the highest returns in markets where we have the longest tenure, the mid-Atlantic and Northern California.","In our business, tenure matters in terms of market intelligence, experience, reputation and relationships.","And lastly, while these returns represent a mix of unrealized or projected returns and realized returns, the average is consistent with what has been realized through our dispositions over the last 10 years, as shown on attachment 12 of this release.","And lastly, turning to slide 16, this long-term track record has certainly extended to the current cycle. So far, this cycle, we've delivered around $4.5 billion of new development at yields that have generated initial NAV accretion of around $2 billion and healthy earnings accretion contributing to annual compounded growth in core FFO of almost 13% over the last six years, a period of time when core FFO per share has more than doubled and dividends have grown by more than 50%.","So, in summary, while we are seeing some moderation in fundamentals, it appears that we are settling into a period of equilibrium as the economic expansion plays out. Of course, some markets and some markets will outperform while others might lag. But overall, demand and supply seem to be really in balance and projected to remain that way over the next two to three years.","And as we move into the later stages of a very healthy apartment cycle, we continue to exercise a disciplined approach to the capital allocation, both in how we raise and deploy capital, and that should allow us to generate solid earnings and NAV growth that will help us outperform.","And with that, Jessica, we'd be happy to open the call for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","So, looking through the presentation last night, we noticed that I guess this quarter, you didn't break out the market-by-market assumptions that are driving the changes in guidance versus guidance as of last quarter. Are you able to provide those on the call this morning?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hey, Rich. This is Sean. I can give you a sort of a general overview of where we're seeing market performance relative to our midyear expectations, if that's helpful. Obviously, it was a very modest reduction in terms of full year same-store revenue guidance. And essentially, where the shortfall is occurring is primarily in four places: it's Northern California, the Greater New York Region, including parts of New Jersey, the Mid-Atlantic and then in Ferry Field County. Those are the four main drivers of the shortfall relative to our original expectation. So, it's not a meaningful difference, but enough that the adjustment was required.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","All right. Thanks, Sean. And then would you be able to breakout the new and renewal divisions to the different markets from 3Q (14:35)","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","For the third quarter?","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","...4Q? Yeah, third quarter and then maybe what you're seeing today in the fourth quarter as well?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure. For the third quarter blended rent change was 3.5%, and I'm just going to walk through the markets here that represent 3.2% in New England, about 2.5% in the Metro New York\/New Jersey region, just over 3% in the Mid-Atlantic, 5.2% in the Pacific Northwest, 2.7% in Northern California, and mid-5% in Southern Cal. That blends to 3.5%.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks. And then my final question here concerns development. So, it looks like implicitly, I guess, starts are expected to go up in the fourth quarter versus what happened in the third quarter. And just a general question, I guess, how are you guys feeling about the development pipeline today? And have any of your assumptions changed in terms of how you're underwriting the projected yields on the overall pipeline or the things that you're starting in the near term?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hi, Rich. This is Matt. Yeah. No. We are expecting a lot of start volume here in the fourth quarter. It was always really in the plan that the starts were going to be back loaded this year. And it's really just a function of when those deals work their way through the system and are ready to start. So, we haven't \u2013 I wouldn't say our view has changed in any material way in terms of the attractiveness or the profitability of the development platform. We're still adding new development rights through the course of the year.","They're still kind of at the same current economics. Again, we underwrite to kind of today's rents and cost and expenses that don't really trend. That we're still seeing on average our development rights pipeline underwriting to about a mid-60s yield. Some variation by region, but that's been pretty consistent really for the last several years.","The only thing that's really potentially changed is just different deals will move around quarter-to-quarter. So, whether we wind up with the start volume for the total year that we expect at the beginning of the year, probably just depends on what happens with the Columbus Circle deal and whether that starts this quarter or it may slip-in to the first quarter next year.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","All right. Yeah, thanks for that, Matt. I guess maybe one follow-up there. Just simply to the extent that the current environment has deteriorated over the course of 2016, I think where we might be a little bit confused is just how some of the assumptions haven't changed much. I mean, is that just a function of underwriting rents versus the basis that you guys have locked in or is it \u2013 or are we misinterpreting kind of the way the numbers move there?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Rich, this is Tim. I mean rents are continuing to increase in our markets generally. And so, it's a function of how it interplays with the construction costs, for sure. We are seeing some moderation in some markets on construction cost now. Land cost as you know is locked in. So, in terms of overall economics on a current basis, as Matt mentioned, we haven't seen a big change. We published the deals that completed this quarter that stabilized at a 6.4%. We've got about $2.5 billion that are under construction that we still estimate are a 6.4% and that's what most of that pipeline not really mark-to-market yet, which we would anticipate that to gravitate up. And then just the deals we've been putting under a contract in 2016, which probably has been a little bit of surprise that they've been as attractive as we \u2013 from an economic standpoint as they've been are kind of consistent with those kinds of returns.","So, the assumptions are always based upon what we're seeing in the markets today and I think that's what Matt meant in terms of our underlying assumptions haven't changed in terms of how they're derived.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's helpful, Tim. Thank you.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Tim, you mentioned the increase to same-store expense growth is driven by utilities and the delay in tax appeals. But can you talk about what's driving the growth of the more controllable expenses? Looks like payroll, R&M and the office operations were up this quarter?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Nick. This is Sean. Why don't I give you an overview of the change from the mid-year guidance that we've provided as compared to what we provided last night, if that's helpful? But the growth change, if you call it combined third quarter and fourth quarter or back half of the year represents around $2.6 million, $2.7 million. About a third of that is timing related. And the majority of that ties to three tax appeals in LA County that were scheduled and anticipated to occur in Q4 that looks like they're going to slip into Q1. And then the balance of the timing-related component relates to the start-up of a co-gen facility at one our New York high-rise assets that's been delayed a little bit.","So, about a third that we'll get, we're just going to get it probably closer to Q1 as opposed to Q4. But in terms of the absolute amount of the change, it's about 70 basis points if you look at the mid-year guidance we provided basically around 2.4% to where we are at 3.1% today. The major components are the utilities. It's about $1.8 million, taxes around $700,000, and then there's couple hundred thousand related to insurance and payroll. Again, that's sort of comparing back half of 2016 as compared to our mid-year reforecast.","So, a big chunk of it, again, is timing-related. But those are the primary drivers of the difference as compared to what we had said earlier at mid-year.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for that breakdown. And then when you say concessions, can you talk about if you're using concessions on any stabilized properties today, what markets you're doing that? And if it's free rent or gift cards or any other details you can provide on that?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. For the most part, we don't use a lot of concessions, but we do use them in certain markets. And I'd say it depends on a couple of things, Nick. Obviously, in New York, you'd probably see a greater use of concession given some of the legal rent issues that surround that market.","And then in certain situations where we think there may be just a bulk of delivery that's coming through at a particular quarter or two, that sort of impacts the then current environment, and we want to take sort of a temporary hit as opposed to the full 12 months of reducing the rent when it comes to lease renewal for those customers, that we tend to use. But in terms of the concessions that we granted in the third quarter, it's about $440,000. About 50% of it was in San Francisco. About another 25% is in the Pacific Northwest, which has been a healthy market but it tends to be a market where there's just a greater use of concessions. So, we used concessions last year, we used concessions this year. It's just sort of the nature of the barter in Seattle.","But if you look at the year-over-year change, about 85% of the year-over-year increase is really in San Francisco. And that's primarily concentrated at the Mission Bay assets, a little bit at 55 9th, a little bit at Ocean Avenue, which are competing with more of the new deliveries.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. A couple ones. First, on \u2013 a couple markets like \u2013 you think about New York, San Francisco. If you look at actually at Axiometrics data, it's showing that year-over-year there's been no rent growth or slightly negative rent growth in the markets. At what point does that flow into your portfolio, more so, where if market rents just aren't moving, how do you still keep up let's say positive renewals in both markets?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Nick. This is Sean. In terms of a bleeding through the portfolio, the softer market environment this year obviously has already started to bleed through the portfolio, which was our original expectation at the beginning of the year and the guidance that we provided.","The rate at which it bleeds into the portfolio really is a function of a couple of different things. For the most part, it really does depend on turnover rates, because if you're turning over say 54% or 55% of the portfolio year-over-year, that's going to get mark-to-market to some degree. And then the balance of it really is in renewals. And historically, we have seen more pricing power with renewals relative to new move-ins because of switching costs and things of that sort.","So, it takes a period of time for that to happen. So, obviously in some markets, we are seeing rents go down relative to this point last year, I'd say particularly in markets like San Francisco or a little bit in New York City. But we're seeing overall positive rent change currently in those markets. I'd say it's due to two reasons. One is, we probably are performing slightly better than the market average in those markets. And secondly is just the function of the renewals versus new move-ins that I described previously.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Just second question maybe for Tim. Are you seeing any change in cap rates for where multifamily assets are trading in the private market? I mean, if we think about how much rent growth has slowed in some markets and just looking at multifamily sector overall for the REITs, we've also seen growth slowing. How \u2013 it's hard for I think some people to imagine how cap rates won't move higher to reflect this. What are you seeing for asset values today? Thanks.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, Nick, I think I'll probably defer to Matt or acquisition dispositions reports to him. But obviously we've been active on the disposition side both for our own portfolio and as we wind down some of the funds and that we've been more active on the acquisition side in a couple of markets. But, Matt, maybe you can just speak to kind of what we've been seeing there from a cap rate perspective.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I think it probably does vary by market and by asset type. And really it's a function of where the capital is most aggressive. So, what we're finding is older assets are the value add story, particularly on the West Coast, it's still very, very deep. In early October we sold one asset, Avalon Brandemoor in the northern suburbs of Seattle and that was a sub-5% cap rate on an asset that was 15 years old and a good submarket but not one of the more sought after submarkets in Metro Seattle. And that's just a reflection of the fact there's a lot of value add money chasing that story, if you will.","In some other locations, I don't know really. I couldn't tell you where Northern California cap rates are today. Obviously, there's been a lot of deceleration of NOI growth there. And we have not bought or sold anything in Northern Cal in a while. And I think that volumes are down a little bit there because of that.","So we haven't been selling kind of real core stuff and that's where you might see the impacts felt more so. But we don't have any direct evidence to speak to that on either the buy or the sell-side?","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Spector with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. I'm here with Juan Sanabria. I guess just wanted to focus a little bit more, Tim, on some of your key points talking about moderation equilibrium the next two to three years. Obviously, this year, there were a few issues to cause management to lower guidance. How should we think about those comments in the next two to three years? What's giving you comfort that we stay there, or what are some of the assumptions behind those comments?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, Jeff, we've tried to say that in slide 9. I mean, first of all, in terms of changes in guidance, that's really a reflection of it being a weaker economic environment than consensus or us had anticipated. So, to the extent the environment deteriorates further, and we are anticipating some moderation in both in job growth and an increase in supply in our markets over the next couple of years.","But I think we show on slide 9 that we think it's roughly about \u2013 and if you look at the overall housing picture, we're starting up between 1.1 million and 1.2 million units per year, about 400,000 of those are multi-families and almost all of those are rental. On a percentage basis, that's about what you're seeing in terms of rental propensities right now. It just seems like the market is producing housing that's consistent with what we're seeing from a marginal demand standpoint, which auto translates into inflation or maybe a little bit better in terms of rent growth. And I think if you're seeing tightness anywhere, it's probably more in the for sale arena where there's still seeing 5% kind of growth in value.","So, we're not seeing too much supply in terms of the overall housing picture. We are seeing pockets of oversupply for sure. We've talked about those markets, and so, some will lead and some will lag, but overall, based upon on an economy that's growing at, call it 2% and jobs that are growing around 1.5% and supply that's being delivered into the market at about 1.5% of stock. That just looks like the equilibrium to us. Supply being roughly equivalent to demand.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Do you also assume that in 2018 that supply is going to really come down or no, that's not part of the thought process right now?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Modestly, Jeff. I think it may come down less for a couple of reasons. One, I think the projections for 2017 are probably going to prove out to be too high again because it's just seems like supply just gets delayed. Some of this what I think over the last couple of years, 15% to 20% of what we're expecting to hit in that year and it ended up getting delayed. So, if anything, we've been overestimating supply for the next year. And so, I suspect some of the 2017 deliveries will leak into 2018 and that you'll see a more \u2013 I think you'll see a fairly level supply picture for the next couple of years is our own sense.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And Juan has a question.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just, if I could follow-up on Jeff's point, if you could just talk through your 2017 supply assumptions across your major markets? And in particular, maybe if you could touch on Northern California, how that comes on line throughout 2017? Is it front-end loaded or is it kind of pretty evenly distributed throughout the year?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Juan. This is Sean. Why don't I take that one? In terms of the expectations for 2017, before I kind of run through the markets, one thing to keep in mind, as Tim noted, is for the most part over the last three years, I'd say supply has been \u2013 call it stretched out if you want to think about it that way where expected deliveries are pushed off into the subsequent period.","But in terms of what we're seeing for 2017 right now across our markets, the expectations were going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of about 2% of inventory. And the way that breaks down, to give you some perspective, is the New England market is about 2.5%; Metro New York and New Jersey, around 1.8%; Mid-Atlantic, 5.2%; Pacific Northwest, still elevated up at 3.7%; Northern Cal, mid-2%s, and Southern Cal kind of in the mid-1% range. My expectation is those are going to trend down as we digest numbers and refresh our supply pipeline when we get to January.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","And one thing to keep in mind is some of those deals that are in the pipeline are projected starts, but when people start looking at their numbers and I would say construction costs, up quite a bit over the last couple of years if they've been processing a deal, and then a tightening that we've seen in the financial markets as it hits the construction lending and a little bit on the equity side as well that some of those deal prices aren't going to make.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And just one quick follow-up, are you seeing any pull into San Francisco of demand that otherwise would have been in Oakland or San Jose from the discounting for the new projects?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","A little bit, but nothing that's really discernible that shows up in the data that you could call it a significant trend. Typically, it takes a period of time for that to happen. And we've been talking about certainly decelerating growth in San Francisco for the last few quarters, but it's really only, I'd say, in the last six months that it's really come down quite a bit and people on year leases and things like that.","So, it typically takes a year or two for that phenomenon really to occur. If you think about the early part of this cycle, San Francisco outperformed quite a while and San Jose as well before the East Bay sort of caught up. And the East Bay has been outperforming in the last couple of years of the cycle.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. I was just curious if you could update on your outlook for job growth. I think last quarter, you mentioned it came down 50 basis points roughly from your expectation, but just curious where your outlook is as we move into 2017?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Austin, this is Sean. Why don't I take the first and then maybe Matt would want to comment as well. But in terms of the forecast for 2016, we rely on several different jobs to kind of get aligned around where we think job growth is going to end up, that includes sort of the (33:02) consensus as well as Moody's. And right now, the numbers are sort of in the 2.3 million to 2.4 million jobs range for the calendar year. And in terms of 2017, the expectation is for job growth at least at this point to be relatively similar to 2016. So, certainly, that will be updated as the Q4 evolves and we get to January, but the expectation is that job growth will be relatively similar next year and for this year, which is down, as Tim mentioned, relative to 2015 and 2014.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","And maybe just a follow up to that, as I mentioned earlier, it's around 1.5% and our markets were expecting about 1.7%. And the only real anomaly is at Seattle where we're still expecting job growth north of 3%. The others are kind of in the mid 1% range, all of the regions.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And then, just on D.C., it's been one of the few submarkets that's been accelerating. It stalled a bit this quarter. I know you highlighted it from a question earlier in the call. But just curious what your thoughts are and how this market \u2013 how it should fare moving forward? Do you still see acceleration coming?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. This is Sean, Austin. Yeah, the trend we believe that will occur is continued acceleration and revenue performance there. We thought it would have accelerated probably a little bit more in the third quarter and fourth quarter, but it's still kind of bumping along here.","So, still one thing to realize is job growth has been much better in the D.C. metro area, but supply has still been plentiful. So, we're going to continue to see it rise, but it's going to be at a pretty moderate pace as we move into next year.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And what are supply projections in 2017 versus this year?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","For D.C. facility?","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","For your market. Yes. For your markets in D.C.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","For the Mid-Atlantic, it looks like it's right around just over 2.5%, and that's just a little bit higher than it was this year.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates.","Hardik Goel - Zelman & Associates","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to talk about the two acquisitions that I know you've mentioned attractive merchant deals in the past. Just wondering given the fact that you have such good economics in your own development pipeline, how did you think about the two deals there? I think if I'm not wrong, one of them was a lease-up, another one was the land swap of sorts. Could you provide more details on that and the yields you expect?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Hardik. This is Matt. I can speak to that. I wouldn't say it's either or between the two investment activities. We're really not funding acquisitions through expansion of the balance sheet. It's really portfolio management. So essentially, we are in the market when we think that there are assets that are attractively priced. And if we find assets that we like, then we can always fund those through incremental dispositions. And we've wound up this year selling more than we probably plan to sell at the beginning of the year because we have been successful in finding some interesting acquisition candidates. So, that doesn't really displace development activity from a funding point-of-view. So, that's the first thing.","And then in terms of the specific deals, we have been concentrating in the Mid-Atlantic. For the most part, we sold down in the Mid-Atlantic back in 2011 and 2012, kind of saw the softness coming here. So, we're actually under allocated against our kind of long-term targets. We haven't been as actively developing in this market through this cycle either. So, the one deal we bought in South Arlington after you allocate to the retail, we think, basically, it's a low-5% cap. 330,000 a unit for concrete frame construction, it's eight or nine years old, that's below replacement cost for that submarket.","So, we felt that was a pretty compelling buy. That's a submarket that's suffered some in the last couple of years and we think has bottomed out and we're starting to see positive revenue growth there again, so, we feel like it was a well-timed acquisition and should be a great investment,","The other deal we bought, just completed a lease-up. It's a smaller deal in North Hollywood and that the other region, I'd say were under allocated too at this point, is Southern California. It's been more difficult there because cap rates are quite a bit lower than there in the Mid-Atlantic. But still, that deal we think it's a low 4%s cap. And after allocating to the retail, we think the basis in the residential is about 400,000 a unit, which again, is a pretty compelling basis for that location, and that's a submarket where we are looking for more exposure where we see a lot of good things happening. And we think that we're in a good point in the cycle there.","Hardik Goel - Zelman & Associates","And just as a follow-up. Those are economic cap rates, right? And it'd be really helpful to get economic caps on the dispositions as well, overall.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Those are \u2013 I would say those are \u2013 I'm not sure what you mean by economic cap rates.","Hardik Goel - Zelman & Associates","Minus CapEx, I guess. CapEx-adjusted (37:58)","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. There's kind of a typical lender reserve CapEx number in there, but it's consistent. The dispose we've been selling this year we sold about $275 million in wholly-owned assets, and the cap rates there have been in the mid-5%s. And then we've also sold some fund assets. And of course, we've sold the asset in Seattle earlier this month that's not in that $275 million. That was a high-4%s cap.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. To be clear, when we quote cap rates, we're putting them on a market convention basis in terms of how the market would underwrite CapEx, not necessarily how we might underwrite CapEx for a particular asset.","Hardik Goel - Zelman & Associates","Got it. All right. Thank you. That's all from my end.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Good morning. Sean, what were overall new and renewals in 3Q for the portfolio? And how is that trending into October?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Conor. In terms of movements in Q3, average 2.1%, renewals were 4.8% blended to the 3.5% in Q3. And in October, obviously, the call is a little bit earlier this year than last year as I recall. But basically low-2% range for October to-date. This data is as of I'd call it a few days ago basically and still running in the high-4%s on the renewals, but slightly negative on the new move-ins, which is primarily a result of Northern California and New York and New England and Boston markets. A little bit of a push on our part to get a little more occupancy as we get into the latter part of the fourth quarter. So, a little more pressure on rate in October.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Great. And, Sean, I know last year in 3Q, you guys were aggressive in pushing price and taking the dip in occupancy. Do you think you're too aggressive this year in dropping occupancy to get price and particularly in the mid-Atlantic?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, last year, I'd say we were relatively aggressive. This year, as the years evolve, the posture has changed. Every market's a little bit different and really every asset's a little bit different. But I'm not sure that we would revisit the decisions a lot in the mid-Atlantic. We basically put out an expectation mid-year that things would continue to improve at a greater rate than what's actually occurred. Whether you can tie that back to rate of occupancy and say that we were too aggressive, I wouldn't necessarily say that. We were trying to push a bit. But to get the rate growth, you've got to have some of the occupancy, and if the occupancy doesn't show up, you're just not going to get it. So, I think it's really a blend of both. I wouldn't just say it's a one piece or the other.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Great. Thank you. And then, Matt, you earlier mentioned the delay at Columbus Circle. Is that due to permitting, or is that more a continued problem with finding a retail partner there?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Conor, its Tim. I can speak to that. I mean, we've been demolishing the existing building there for a good part of the year. We're just completing that process now, and still need to get final sign-off by the city.","So, it's really been probably more a function of that. And I think as we reported maybe last quarter or the quarter before, we are still considering bringing in a capital partner there. It's not necessarily a requirement from our perspective, it's something we are considering, but that isn't holding up work. And we'll probably get started with maybe some site-enabling work here before the end of the year, but between kind of where \u2013 how long it took us to get the demolition done and finishing up our plans is looking at it's just looking like right around the end of the year for the start of the new building.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay. And that will be the only deal that would possibly cause you to miss your guidance for $1.2 billion in starts this year?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","We think so. We think so at this point. The others look like they're pretty much going to happen in November, early December.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning. Sean, you talked earlier about the weakness in Northern California and New York City among other markets. When you're looking at supply coming on line in those markets that are directly impacting your assets or likely to directly impact your assets, if you assume job growth remains static, I mean, when is the sort of peak sort of disruption to your assets from an operational standpoint? Are we in that now? Is that sometime in early 2017? Is that back-end 2017? How are you guys thinking about that?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. And you think about two specific markets thereof in terms of New York and Northern Cal, I assume.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Yeah.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Is that what you're thinking about primarily?","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Yep.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, so, I think for the most part, if you look at it, New York, supply is actually expected to increase in 2017 relative to 2016. So, I think the pain is going to continue in New York through 2017 for certain. It's really going to be what Tim said, which is a function of job growth with that being the economic environment that will determine rent change performance and ultimately revenue performance. But supply is expected to continue.","And as it relates to our specific portfolio in New York City, really, what you worry about is supply being delivered in Midtown West is impacting us. That's probably the bulk of it. There's some supply in Long Island City, but it's more downtown than on the waterfront. And Long Island City is actually performing quite well. The other market that we'll probably going to start to see more pressure is in Brooklyn. There's more deliveries in Brooklyn next year as compared to this year. For the most part, it's been a relatively light year in deliveries. It's just starting to pick up in Q4. So, that's sort of the broad picture in New York.","As it relates to Northern California, also expect to see a pickup in deliveries in Northern California next year, about 40 basis points, 50 basis points as compared to 2016. It goes from about 1.8% to 2.3%. Again, we're going to be massaging those numbers as we get to December and January. A number of those deals are already under construction, of course. But for the most part, what we're seeing is that those deals have been delayed in terms of actually getting through the system, getting everything signed off, et cetera. But if you look at where the deliveries are going to be concentrated, it's sort of the same places really in terms of what's happening mid-market, south market, et cetera.","So, in terms of our portfolio, the Mission Bay assets and 55 9th will continue to be impacted in 2017. I don't have the quarterly breakdown for 2018 at this point, probably a little premature to talk about it. But by January, we'll have a pretty good outline of that.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And then your turnover levels look pretty sort of static. Are you seeing any material increase in days vacant between turns?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Not really. When you look at it on a quarter-over-quarter basis, it's not really changing much. I think the third quarter was around 22%, 23%. That's pretty consistent for the third quarter, a lot of leasing velocity, a lot of turn activities. So, they're not changing materially. You'll see that number increase in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter, as a result of just the seasonal nature of the market and you don't have to turn things as fast because demand is not as robust in those quarters as compared to Q2 and Q3. Therefore, you're not going to outsource turns and things like that that cost more money just to get it done faster.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And then any increase in bad debt?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Bad debt has been higher than our expectation, pretty much all year, around 13 basis points, 14 basis points higher. We expect it to be around 76 basis points or so. We're running closer to 90 basis points. And really, if you look at it for the full year in terms of operating expenses relative to our original budget, we're talking about an insignificant variance. It's like 0.2% in terms of total operating expenses relative to our original budget. And the only difference really is in bad debt.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","Our next question will come from Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. So, going back to your comments on supply and the performance divergence between suburban and urban assets, I was wondering if you could comment \u2013 if you expect that trend to continue, meaning suburban outperforming urban for next couple of years, and supply to remain focused on urban markets?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Maybe I can \u2013 I'll start and maybe Matt or Sean will step in. I think we are expecting supply in urban markets, urban submarkets to be twice that of suburban submarkets in 2017, which is actually a larger disparity than what we saw in 2016. So, you can see on that chart, it's been about a 200-basis-points delta on rent performance over the last, call it, eight quarters. We would expect that certainly to continue into 2017, and maybe to a lesser extent, as you get out into beyond 2018. But over the next one to two years, we think that trend's going to continue.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And then in your initial remarks, you also talked about equilibrium over next couple of years, and disciplined approach to capital allocation. I was wondering what that translates into development starts over the next few years?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, we have a pipeline of close to $4 billion, which would suggest kind of low-$1 billion range in terms of starts assuming they continue to make sense and they get through the process, and the economics make sense.","But from a discipline standpoint, I guess I'd say a few things. Once we start Columbus Circle and the Hollywood deal, we'll actually have less than $100 million of land on the balance sheet, which actually is a cyclical low and maybe lower than last two cycles. So, part of the discipline has been around managing that land exposure in terms of when you actually buy the land versus option the land.","And then secondly, as we've been talking about over the last few quarters is how we capitalize the deal once we do start them. As I mentioned, we're around 85% match-funded without consideration of any free cash flow right now. So in effect, we've already capitalized what's already been started and not just in \u2013 as we get later and later in the cycle, we'll continue to be conservative with how we manage the exposure of unfunded commitments.","So, it's going to be somewhat dependent on how attractive the deals are relative to the capital environment at this time. But as we said, on one of the slides, we showed one of the slides, over the last 20 years as a public company, we have demonstrated we can continue to create value through all phase of the cycles as long as you are disciplined, how you bring those deals into the pipeline and ultimately how you capitalize them.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey. Good morning. Just two questions here. First, on slide 15, the returns that you guys have had on the developments over time, just surprised that the West Coast has had lower returns on average than the East Coast. Would have thought that there would have been more cap rate compression to drive higher returns, so if you could just give a comment maybe it's the fact that's just land from the get-go was more expensive out there, and therefore, you just never get there but that part was a little bit surprising given cap rate compression?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Alex, Tim here. Yeah. I guess the point here and part of the slide is being a good or a skilled capital allocator is as much about sort of timing and being tactically smart. And by the way, this is all investment, so it isn't just development, this would include acquisitions to be clear. And interestingly, our return on acquisitions aren't materially different than development, which sort of speaks to being highly disciplined sort of \u2013 in terms of investing earlier in the cycle with respect to acquisitions.","I mentioned in our comments, we've made more money where we've been the longest, Northern California and Mid-Atlantic. So, part of that is just understanding the markets, having deeper relationships, being confident that you're focused on the right deals at the right time of the cycle, which only comes through experience and track record in our view.","So, I think \u2013 and then the last thing I'd say is this is only through Q3 of 2014. So, I think if you looked at Seattle in particular, just given some of our recent deals that have completed, those numbers actually will go up from what you see there of around 10.3%. In the case of Southern California, you're just starting at such a low going-in yield, cap rate compression has really occurred throughout, really, all of our markets, probably through all the markets nationally. And if anything, where you're probably seeing it is there's probably a more cap rate compression on the urban product than there has been in the suburban products.","So it's probably been \u2013 it probably hasn't been geographical as much as it's been sub-market focused. But again, it comes down \u2013 we're looking at managing to total return and sometimes that's investing at higher-yielding, slower-growth markets. Sometimes it's lower-yielding, higher-growth markets. And I think this chart just really reflects that.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then the second question is in response to one of the analysts' questions earlier about San Francisco and if you're seeing sort of a back flow from East Bay back into San Francisco, you said you're not. Are you seeing any change in demand in San Francisco or is it because your portfolio has a \u2013 good chunk of it is suburb that, maybe, you're not seeing \u2013 you're not feeling the impact of a lot of the two-month rent concession that's attracting renters to move around San Francisco?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Alex. Sean. A couple of things. In terms of my comment earlier about people moving from the East Bay back into the city or back into San Jose, my response is really that we've seen a little bit of that, but it's not a meaningful number at this point, given things have decelerated in San Francisco obviously pretty quickly that if someone was considering living in San Francisco at this time last year relative to the East Bay, that's a pretty expensive proposition. And whether you've started to see meaningful deceleration in the second half of this year in that market, people sign one-year leases, they typically lag a year or two before they say, okay, the rents have really come down. I think that's the right kind of trade to make.","And my point was during the beginning part of the cycle, San Francisco and San Jose outperformed quite well before the East Bay caught up, and then the East Bay has been outperforming the last couple of years. So, you would expect that to occur just in the opposite direction as the market decelerates.","And in terms of the comment about demand, I mean, certainly, as Tim pointed out, it is a weaker economic environment and I think many of us anticipated, which has resulted in lower job growth across the market with the exception probably of Seattle. And Northern California has not been immune from that. So, there's certainly a weaker demand profile in Northern California. It just so happens to be at a time when we have meaningful supply being delivered in San Francisco. And, therefore, you're seeing one month or two month concessions sort of the norm on all of the new deliveries in San Francisco as an example.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Sean, do you feel that you're sort of on the tail end of that or you think that we're having \u2013 you guys expect to have another year of that and, therefore, as you outline next year, you're still going to be talking about the pressure on demand and supply in San Francisco?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I still think there's going to be demand. I mean, assuming that job growth is basically the same and deliveries continue at the rate that's forecasted, which pretty much is vague at this point because those buildings are delivering now. I would expect that Northern California and San Francisco specifically, that's what you're interested in, will continue to be a weak environment. So, we saw a significant uptick in job growth. That equation might change.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","We'll take a question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. I just was curious about your comment about the apartments reaching sort of a steady state. And as I'm thinking about what you've put on the boards the first nine months relative to your full year guidance, it looks like to me, maybe revenue growth and NOI growth in the fourth quarter might be decelerating to 3.4% and 2.7%. So, I'm wondering if I was thinking about that correctly.","And then number two, if that's sort of the steady state we should be thinking about going into 2017 or are we supposed to be more bullish or maybe a little bit more cautious? Any color or transparency would be helpful in that regard.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Rich, Tim here. In terms of Q4, I think your math's approximately correct as it relates to kind of what we're looking for the \u2013 in terms of year-over-year growth. Steady state for us or equilibrium shouldn't be a whole lot more than inflation from our perspective. I think historically, if you looked at our markets, we've been able to generate roughly 70, 75 basis points stronger growth than inflation, whereas nationally, it's been probably a little bit closer to inflation. And that's equated into a kind of high 2%, maybe just sub-3% kind of rent growth. And so...","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","...we're talking about equilibrium. That's the kind of rate of growth we expect to see. We obviously started this year well above that trend. And so, while we have seen moderation, our view has been it's been moderating more towards an industry that's starting to approach demand and supply being roughly equal after six years of really in balance. And it's kind of what you'd expect after a while in capital markets where capital should flow freely to businesses that are sustaining outperformance.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Yeah. I mean \u2013 and to that point, and maybe taking a little bit more of a positive and longer-term view, do you characterize this supply that's coming to market as more of a bottleneck? Or looking longer term, can you make the case that we have enough apartments in the United States or maybe we even need a little bit more apartments in the United States? So I'm curious in your view as an owner of apartments...","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","...and most likely taking a 10-year view rather than a 6- to 12-month view, how do you think about that? So, said other way \u2013 yeah, go ahead.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. No. I think I followed. Our expectations, we're going to see household formation of over 1 million, 1.2 million to 1.4 million kind of on a steady state basis based upon a reasonable growth in population and jobs. And our view is that if you just look at underlying demographics in I would millennials age that we're going to see more balanced housing demand between for sale and rental. Most of the rental has been \u2013 I mean most of the multi-family that has been built has been purpose built as rental.","And so, right now, you have an industry that's generating about 1.2 million houses, new units against demand that's about 1.2 million. About two-thirds of that is single family, which is the only purpose built is for sale, and about a third of that is multi-family, which is purpose built as rental. The numbers almost can't be more imbalanced than that.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, got it.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","So, we look at \u2013 we're going from an industry that's been out of balance where real housing demand has been close to 80% or more of total housing demand, kind of an earlier sort of cycle to where it seems like we've found sort of a new normal, if you will. So, that's our view.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just there's been a lot of talk recently about rent control hitting the ballot during the election season in the Bay Area. Just kind of curious what you're hearing, what you think the probability of that happening is, and what could be the potential impact to your portfolio?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Tayo. It's Sean. You are correct that rent control is on the ballot in about five different municipalities in the Northern California market. Only one of the \u2013 I can't speak to exactly what's likely to pass and what's not. That probably changes from week to week depending on which poll you read. But there is support for \u2013 more of the majority support for some of those ordinances based on recent polling.","There's really only one that potentially impacts our portfolio, which is the proposed rent control ordinance in Mountain View. And if you look at it, it depends on how it's actually adopted. There's actually two proposed ordinances on the ballot in Mountain View, one that's sponsored by the city, and the other that is sort of a voter referendum. And to the extent that it comes to fruition, Mountain View, overall, when you look at the assets that are impacted, it would impact around 9% to 10% of our Northern California revenue in terms of the specific assets that fit the vintage that would be governed by the proposed ordinance.","And the rent increases, it is a blend. It's limited to CPI Plus but it's got a collar on it, minimum 2, max 5. And you can bank it, so you're going to get it over time one way or another in terms of what's happening in the market through (01:00:53) control, et cetera.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird & Company.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to break down New York Metro a little bit more. You mentioned that New York Metro results disappointed year-to-date relative to your expectations. I assume that's been driven more by New York City with New York suburban and New Jersey actually both showing sequential acceleration in 3Q. Did that sequential acceleration in those suburban markets surprise you or is that something that was in the underwriting?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","No. We did expect some acceleration in those markets. It actually came in a little bit short of our expectations, but we did expect some acceleration in those markets. If you look at the fourth quarter, we are falling short across the geography, New York and Metro New Jersey, less so in New Jersey than certainly in New York and particularly in New York City. But for the most part, I'd say, the Greater New York region has fallen short of expectations and to a certain degree in New Jersey but just more moderately so.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","You would characterize the suburban kind of marginal weakness kind of trickle-down from what's happening in New York with new supply and people just adjusting to pricing in the market or what might be behind that?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","No, I wouldn't say that it's significantly weaker. Just we thought things would pick up a little bit more, but the job growth in that region has been weaker over the last six months. So, I think, it's more widespread as opposed to as it relates to \u2013 most people are moving from Central Jersey to Manhattan, as an example, just that trade and rent, usually doesn't make much sense. You don't see that happen. The same thing when you get into Westchester or Long Island, making the trades come into the city is just prohibitively expensive.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then one quick one on the Downtown Brooklyn development. I noticed the completion date was away from 4Q 2016 to 1Q 2017, but it looks like the leasing statistics and stabilization date are on pace and nothing's really changed there. So, I'm just curious what's behind kind of moving the completion date?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Drew, this is Matt. It's really just \u2013 when we get into finishing a building, particularly a building of that size and complexity, when we're actually going to be able to kind of close out all the books and everything. And whether the last apartment homes' turn over for occupancy in December or January, it's going to be somewhere right around that timeframe. So, it's not a response to anything we're seeing. As you pointed out, the lease up's been doing great. So, it's just a question of it's a 440-some-million-dollar asset. So, we may keep the books open one quarter longer just to make sure we've got everything.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question here. Most have been answered already. But just sticking with the New Jersey commentary, not necessarily the answer to just the last question but earlier I thought it sounded like Jersey was specific markets where you're seeing some of that slow down relative to earlier expectations. I would presume that's sort of Jersey City Waterfront markets, but just curious if it's more widespread than that.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, this is Sean, Vincent. In terms of our portfolio, we really only have one asset in Jersey City. So, there's certainly a meaningful amount of supply being delivered there. But the portfolio performance isn't significantly impacted by just that one asset. As I mentioned, I said job growth has slowed in that region over the last six months.","And I think it's more widespread and it's just representative of what you're seeing across all of those markets, whether it'd be parts of Central Jersey, Northern, Long Island, Westchester et cetera, job growth has come down across the entire region. So, yeah, that's really what you're seeing is more softer demand. The supply is sort of as expected.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Got it. Thanks. And then you really have talked about most of markets here except for LA. So, just curious if you could give us some commentary on what you're seeing there. We have seen some slowing in the same-store revenue growth for a couple quarters now, and job growth there also seems to be also decelerating. So, how should we be thinking about LA going into 2017?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, for the most part, LA is performing quite well. I mean, there's the only place where there's any pocket of weakness, really, is to get stabilize the assets let's say in Downtown LA as an example. Whether it's a meaningful amount of supply being delivered there, we only have one operating asset there, (01:05:46) that we completed earlier in the cycle.","But for the most part, LA is tracking just fine. Job growth has been slightly weaker, and so that's weighed on performance a little bit. But in terms of our expectation for that market, we're tracking pretty close to what we expect in the back half of the year.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","Our next question will come from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, it's Michael Bilerman. Tim, I'm curious as you think back to the Archstone transaction where you and EQR split up the portfolio. If assets were to come to market within your six regions, I guess, where and obviously at the right price, and at the right cost of capital, I guess, which regions or markets would be most interested to you to deepen your presence?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Michael. I've got couple of comments. First of all, one of the things that was great about the Archstone transaction, it basically allowed us to get roughly to a target portfolio, particularly as related to Southern California, which we sort of had always been short in. But right now, we're not significantly off kind of where we'd like to be in any one region. I think Matt mentioned it's been a little bit behind our buying in the D.C. area. But we think tactically, it's not a bad time to be buying there, and we have been a little under-allocated since we (01:07:15) bid kind of in early 2010 or earlier this decade.","So, it's probably from a market standpoint, it's probably still D.C. and Southern California because those are markets where we could probably still stay in a little bit more allocation, and we don't think from a market condition standpoint and cycle standpoint, it's too bad of a time to be investing a little bit more cap loans and trimming in some other areas.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And as you think about sort of the debt and equity capital that's out there to finance apartment transactions, obviously we've been \u2013 we've come off two years of significant activity by private equity and buying large apartment portfolios and platforms. How do you sort of look at the market today in terms of being able to finance larger deals both from a debt and equity perspective?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","I'll maybe just speak from a public market standpoint and maybe wake up Kevin over here, who's been absent in this conversation. So...","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","He gets one. He gets one.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","But you look at where the apartment rates are trading obviously relative to underlying NAV. It doesn't make sense to be using your balance sheet to finance. To the extent you see a portfolio out there looks better than what you currently own and you can finance it through some kind of asset swap or 1031, perhaps that makes sense. That (01:08:41) from an unsecured standpoint, but we wouldn't be looking \u2013 and I don't know that \u2013 I guess I'd be surprised if anybody is actively looking at really levering up to grow at this point in the cycle. And so, unless you can find a way to do it on a leverage-neutral way, I think public entities are probably at a disadvantage today to the extent something came to market.","Kevin, any other thoughts? You want to say hello?","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","A comment on Southern California leasing spreads, too. So, Michael, I guess, certainly, from a financing point of view in the private markets, things are tightening up a little bit, particularly on the construction area, as many of you are well aware already.","So, I think from a supply standpoint, longer term that is a bit of a headwind for those who are looking to add new supply on the private side and finance it. And the debt markets particularly for small, less well-capitalized developers, pricing and construction financing has probably moved beyond 300 basis points over LIBOR, which affects, of course, what kind of deals pencil.","And then, you've got the OCC, which is \u2013 it's pushing banks to lend less on real estate. And the regulatory environment for banks has become more expensive for them to be active in the construction market and be profitable. And so, I think you're seeing that getting construction financing, particularly in some of these urban submarkets, is a lot more difficult than it has been before.","For stabilized financing, the GSEs certainly have been active for the uncapped business. There is certainly availability that's mostly affordable and types of opportunities. I think they do expect a record production year. The caps have been lifted a number of times but their interest in Class A product is more modest as you're well aware. Nonetheless, banks and insurance companies have been pretty active while CMBS has been far less so due to the risk retention rules.","So, I think when you step back in time to some of the comments Tim made, capital's there for deals that make sense, but it's certainly not as plentiful now as it has been in recent years on the debt market side. And I think probably a lot of \u2013 on the equity side, joint venture sources of capital have been a lot more disciplined because they like you and we have been seeing the same headlines about supply in some of the markets that are out there. So, they're probably a little bit more cautious, but at the same time, relative to some other sectors in real estate, multifamily even at trend level revenue growth does provide pretty healthy returns that one can reasonably bank on achieving over a long term.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Right. Well, I guess that's what sets up divergence between the public stock trading at discounts and whether there's enough private capital out there both from a debt and equity perspective that would find those attractive enough to \u2013 or the companies themselves saying, you know what, I don't want to trade at a discount anymore. I can monetize that spread by tapping into it. The question is is that debt and equity as excited about the multifamily business as it has been over the past couple of years, given the volume of deals that has transpired already. I'm looking for you for the answer.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah and I think it's going to be some of the function of the balance sheet as a target to the extent they're financed more through secured versus unsecured and maybe more doable than \u2013 and we've seen some recent examples of that in the apartment space. Obviously, where we had cleaner balance sheets and more unsecured, they tend to be more kind of public-to-public and where you had more secured financing and maybe a little higher leverage, it tend to be more attractive to the private side. So, I think that's probably as big of a factor as well as just kind of where private versus public market valuations are trending.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question will come from Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on jobs. You've kind of made a commentary about job growth being basically in line with this year and next year. But I wonder, digging a little bit deeper, do you guys look at the types or quality of that job creation? And I ask that because if you look at the higher-paying jobs, professional business services, tech, stuff like that, in some coastal markets we're seeing slowdowns, which would auger for less traffic, especially at the high price point type of assets that you guys have. And I wonder if you've kind of baked that into your guidance, because not all jobs, not all demand is created equal.","So, how do you kind of think about that particularly in, let's say, New York and San Francisco when you have job growth that's may be flat but, for example, in New York, you have a lot of hotel and leisure jobs. And I don't know if they can afford $4,000 a month, $5,000 a month apartment. So, do you guys have a view on that at all?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, we're looking at jobs in a number of ways. I mean, there's pretty good data out there related to kind of mid, high and low-wage job growth. And I think actually we've gotten later in the cycle, we've actually seen stronger growth in our markets, and kind of the mid to higher-wage segments, particularly the mid-wage segments, where it's kind of early in the cycle because I think its little bit more tilted towards lower.","There does seem to be a bit of a disconnect right now. Openings are higher than hires right now, which is putting \u2013 which is a good thing from a wage growth standpoint, which allows people to pay higher rents for sure. But it does seem to be that there may be a growing disconnect between what jobs are open versus the availability of labor to fill them. Certainly, if you look at college graduates, the unemployment \u2013 we're at full employment for sure, people with college degrees. And that is the majority of our residents.","So, you may not see as much job growth there, Neil, for that reason over the next year or two. And I think it's likely to sort of mimic something closer to population growth, but on the other hand, it should translate into stronger wage growth than we've seen maybe kind of in the early years of the cycle.","Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then next question is just given that new leases have slowed across the board, but renewals stay in the mid-single-digits, what is the gain or loss lease in your portfolio, and what's your comfort level on that either way as we go into 2017 or in maybe a slower or a more dubious part of this cycle?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. No. Neil, that's a good question. One thing to think about related to that is gain or loss lease sort of moves around throughout the seasons of the calendar year. In our business, market rents grow pretty rapidly from sort of early-February up through July, early August, and then trail off in terms of what's expected for basically the latter part of the third quarter and the fourth quarter.","So, taking a snapshot of loss to lease, at this moment in time, doesn't necessarily represent how you want to think about rent growth for next year. So, I think you've really got to sort of model it in a way that you look at the typical trajectory of rents from the trough late in the fourth quarter to the peak, to the following August. And then, determine how much you think you're going to get during that period of time that will then ripple through lease expirations. So, that's how we think about it more so than, we've got X percent or X dollars sort of baked in right at this moment based on today's market rent, if that makes sense, does that make sense?","Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Well, yeah, I understand it goes through cycles based on peak or shoulder season. I just mean if you think about how you're rolling over sort of a trailing four quarter period, right, you would have a full cycle or a leasing season. And I just wonder, I think someone asked the question earlier, I mean, when does that start to impact potentially renewals, to essentially you don't want to generate a gain to lease that's unsustainable or that will leave you susceptible if markets turn or job growth slows more than you think.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I guess one way to describe that too, I guess if we just sort of take a snapshot of where the rent roll was today relative to what the rent roll has averaged for 2016, you're kind of in the low 1% range, 1.25% or something like that if nothing happen next year in terms of rents growing at all, you'd be delivering north of 1% revenue growth in sort of a static market. I mean, that's one way to look at it. And then you just have to apply what you think is going to happen with rent growth through the fourth quarter and then throughout 2017 to determine what you think you're actually going to really do in 2017.","Neil Malkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Yeah. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thank you, Noah, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities' fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially.

This attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q4 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin, and Matt Birenbaum. I'll be providing management commentary on the slides that we posted last night, and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.","My comments will focus on providing a summary of Q4 and full-year results, and discussion of our outlook for 2017. My remarks will be a bit longer than usual this quarter, but we think it is an important time in the cycle to provide our perspective, our fundamentals and how we're positioning the company in response.","So, let's get started, starting on slide four. Highlights for the quarter and the year include core FFO growth of 6.5% for Q4 and 8.5% for the year. Same-store revenue growth came in at 3.3% in Q4, or 3.5% when you include redevelopment and for the full-year about 100 basis points higher, 4.3% and 4.5% when you include redevelopment. We completed $500 million in new developments this year and started another $1.6 billion, most of it occurring in Q4. And lastly, we raised about $1.4 billion in external capital through debt and asset sales at an average initial cost of approximately 4%.","Turning now to slide five; development drove strong external growth in 2016, both from recent completions and communities still in lease up. The $500 million of new developments completed this year are projected to stabilize at an average initial yield of 6.7%, about 50 basis points above original pro forma and more than 250 basis points above the initial cost of external capital raise in 2016. Yields on existing lease ups of $1.2 billion of the development are currently 20 basis points above pro forma.","Turning now to slide six. You can see, so far this cycle, we've completed about $4.5 billion in new development and it's created approximately $2 billion in net asset value upon completion, or roughly $17 per share at NAV upon completion. And currently we have another $4 billion under construction, including the $1.3 billion started this past quarter, across five projects shown on the next slide, slide seven.","The five projects started in Q4 include three communities on the West Coast and two on the East Coast. A couple are worth noting due to their size, the first is West 61st Street or Columbus Circle as we referred to in the past, which is a $600 million mixed use project on the upper West side at the corner of 61st in Broadway.","And the second project that is AVA Hollywood, $360 million project, six acres in one of the more vibrant submarkets in LA and located across Santa Monica for many of the studios. Both of these projects represent extremely unique opportunities and excellent submarkets and locations.","Now, given the diversity and the wide range of product in submarkets of our current development pipeline, you'll note this quarter on attachment nine, that we've divided the development portfolio into three distinct buckets based upon product type, high-rise, mid-rise and garden.","These buckets roughly sync up with how we think about submarkets as well being urban or infill or suburban. Given that valuation and cap rates are often a function of product type in submarket, we thought this breakdown would be helpful in evaluating development portfolio.","Lastly, one note on Columbus Circle, as we've discussed in the past, we did explore different strategies to venture this investment with either a retail or a capital partner, but for a variety of reasons including control and current market sentiment, we've concluded that owning 100% of this investment is the best approach to optimizing value.","Moving to slide eight now, our creative development platform along with healthy contributions from our stabilized portfolio has driven strong earnings growth this cycle and we've outperformed the peer group on core FFO growth per share by 350 basis points on a compounded annual basis over the last six years. And on a cumulative basis, that translates into 3,400 basis points of outperformance in core FFO growth during that time.","Let's now turn to slide nine and our outlook for 2017, highlights for outlook include core FFO growth of 5.5%, driven by same-store NOI growth of 2.75% at the midpoint of the range and from stabilization of new investment activity. In addition, we plan to start $900 million in new development and complete $1.7 billion in 2017.","Turning to slide 10, you can see that the lower growth projected in 2017 versus 2016 for core FFO is entirely the result of deceleration in the stabilized portfolio. In 2016, the stabilized portfolio contributed 5.7% of the 8.5% growth that we achieved, while 2017 we're expecting a contribution of 2.7% or 300 basis points less from the stabilized portfolio. The projected contribution from the external growth platform in 2017 is essentially the same as 2016, right around 4% when you net out the impact of incremental capital costs in both years.","In both 2016 and 2017, this growth is offset or expected to be offset by about a 110 basis points of drag from increased overhead and the loss of fees from the liquidation of investment management funds. The reduction of fund-related fees results in a headwind to core FFO growth of roughly 50 basis points in both years.","Turning to slide 11, given our outlook for 2017, we did announce a dividend increase this year of 5.2%. The dividend is now up by almost 60% over the last six years or since the beginning of the cycle, has grown by almost 5.5% on a compounded basis over the last 23 years.","I want to turn now to some of the basic \u2013 to some of key assumptions and drivers for outlook this year. Starting on slide 12, I'm certainly not going to go into detail on this slide, but the overall picture is a continuation of modest economic and job growth with perhaps a little more upside relative to 2016, given the improved outlook for the consumer and a recent pickup in the business sector. But also with more unknowns, with the new administration in place and the potential economic impact that could arise from any fiscal stimulus, tax, trade or immigration reform.","Slide 13 through 17, drills down a bit more on some of these themes. First, looking at slide 13, wage growth is accelerating in a tightening labor market and is most pronounced for our target customer, that being young professionals, who are seeing healthy wage gains in the mid-to-high single digit range, as you can see in the bottom right of that chart.","Moving to slide 14, this in turn is helping to propel consumer confidence, which is now at a cyclical high and then when you combine that with healthy balance sheets, the consumer \u2013 it results in the consumer purchasing more autos and homes and also resulting in higher rates of household formation.","On slide 15, you see the corporate sector is starting to show some improvement as well, as business profits and confidence are on the rise. Although investment remains mixed still with equipment declining and investment in knowledge assets or IP still growing at a healthy clip. It's hard to say whether this is a cyclical or secular trend, as the U.S. moves towards a more knowledge-based economy, but we think for our market this is generally a positive trend.","On slide 16, demographic should continue to support apartment demand really over the next few years and into 2017 for sure. The young adult cohort of that under 34 years is expected to increase by 600,000 in 2017 alone and are now experiencing job growth close to 4%, really the highest rate we've seen this cycle. The rates of family formation as we've discussed in quarters past are continuing to decline, which in turn is extending the rental tenures of this segment and helping to grow primary renter demand.","Moving to slide 17, while rental demand should continue to remain healthy, we are seeing an overall housing picture where overall housing demand is becoming more balanced between single family and multifamily for sale and rental. Just about more than anytime over the last 15 years, it does appear that the for-sale recovery is taking hold after a long period of decline and\/or stagnation, and supply is responding with single family driving virtually all the housing supply growth, while multifamily starts have flattened over recent quarters.","Recently, we've seen starts and permits returning to historical patterns where roughly two-thirds are single family and one-third multifamily. This trend has been further supported by capital market behavior as financing has cooled for multifamily investment over the last year or so.","In the next two slides, slide 18 and 19 provide a demand and supply picture for our regions. On slide 18, you can see that the job growth is expected to be flat or moderately down across most of our footprint. Whereas our wage growth is expected to rise on the order of 150 basis points over 2016 and importantly much of that is already occurring. Personal income overall is projected to be up by about 100 basis points, which should provide the consumer more purchasing power and should help support rent growth, all things remaining equal.","Turning to slide 19, we know that all things don't necessarily remain static and we see that on the supply side of the equation. Apartment deliveries are expected to be up by about 50 basis points in our regions to 2% of stock, which is about a third higher than we saw in 2016. New England, particularly Boston is the only region where we expect deliveries actually to be down on a year-over-year basis. And once again, new supply should be concentrated in urban submarkets. We should see almost twice the deliveries that suburban submarkets in our markets will see in 2017.","So how are these fundaments impacting our portfolio outlook? We show this on slide 20. Overall, we are expecting 2% to 3% same-store revenue growth in 2017. On the East Coast, expecting growth generally on the lower end of that range of around 2% with DC showing some year-over-year improvement.","The West Coast is coming in towards the top end of that range at around 3%, although much more variable across the regions. Northern California is expected to lag in the 1% to 2% range, after years of just torrid performance. And Southern California, Seattle, should lead the portfolio with same-store growth in the 4% to 5% range.","Turning to slide 21; in terms of trajectory during the year, we do expect the same-store revenue growth to decline in the first half of the year, before turning to stabilize in the second half of the year in the low 2% range.","One thing to note from this graph, as you can see, we've already seen same-store revenue rebound once this cycle in 2014 and 2015. Similarly, we think, we could see some improvement in rental rate growth in 2018, once peak deliveries are absorbed into the market.","Let's shift now and talk about investment and capital activity. As I mentioned earlier, we started over $1 billion in Q4, we now have $4 billion under construction or did at year-end. We expect to complete a record level of volume in 2017 such that by the end of the year, development underway should be in the $3 billion range or roughly about 10% of enterprise value, which is in line with the average so far this cycle.","Turning to slide 23, with Q4 starts our charter (16:18) development pipeline is now down to $3 billion and land inventory, which is shown here, is at a cyclical low at around $100 million. We plan to remain light on land over the balance of the cycle. This should position us well to take advantage of any dislocation that might occur during the next market correction, when many of the best land buys are often made.","Turning to slide 24, another way we're managing the risk of our development pipeline, we've talked a lot about over the last couple of years is through our strategy to substantially match funds new development. At year end, including the starts in Q4, we stood at 80% match funded on the $4 billion underway.","In addition, we actually have $800 million in interest rate protection for planned debt issuance later this year. This further protects us from shifts in the capital markets that might impact the cost of future funding and helps us lock in investment margins on that development that's underway.","Slide 25, this is a chart we've shown you before, but it also illustrates another benefit of match funding and that's the impact on our credit profile. With most of our pipeline match funded, we could actually fund the remaining portion entirely with debt without actually comprising our credit profile.","Of course some portion of the remaining cost would likely be funded with free cash flow and our asset sales, but this is a hypothetical calculation that we think is helpful in understanding how the development pipeline may impact our balance sheet and credit metrics from time to time.","And now the last slide, slide 26, I think this shows just a final benefit of match funding, and that's the impact on liquidity. We currently have $200 million of cash on hand and $1.5 billion line of credit was undrawn at year-end. With credit metrics at cyclically strong levels, we have an additional margin of safety and ample balance sheet capacity to fund new commitments that may provide additional growth opportunities.","So there are clear three benefits of a disciplined match funding strategy; first, it allows us to lock-in accretion on new development; second, as we see here, it enhances current liquidity; and third, it preserves balance sheet capacity and provides financial flexibility. From a risk management perspective, all three benefits become increasingly important as the cycle matures.","So, in summary, 2016 was another solid year for the company, healthy fundamentals and our competitive position helped contribute to the sixth consecutive year of strong earnings growth. In 2017, apartment demand should remain healthy, although we do anticipate that an increase in deliveries will temper growth in our stabilized portfolio relative to what we've seen in recent years and in 2016. Development on the other hand should contribute meaningfully to both earnings and NAV growth just as it's done over the last few years.","And lastly, we plan to carefully manage liquidity and the balance sheet to allow us to pursue our growth strategy in a risk-measured way, a strategy that's produced meaningful outperformance so far this cycle.","And with that note, we'll be pleased to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will take our first question from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. I was hoping you guys could just go talk a little bit about the Columbus Circle project. And it looks like \u2013 I guest first off, how we should think about the retail value there, so we can get an understanding for what the cost per unit would be for the multi-family piece.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Nick, this is Tim. I'll take that. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did explore partners there are both in terms of a capital partner and a retail partner. And at the end, we decided control was important here for a few reasons, I may get into, but the economics of that deal are a roughly mid-4% in terms of yield. And I guess the way to think about it, the residential component is around a 4%, the retail component we think is a mid-5%s. And if you look at \u2013 if you try to separate the cost of the retail and the residential, essentially the residential is right around $2,000 a foot on very large units, by the way, something maybe we could talk a little bit about that, but we are positioning \u2013 we're trying to position this asset pretty uniquely towards larger units. We think there is a family market there. This is not a 421 \u2013 421a deals, there are no affordable units. There's no pilot and so this does reflect full taxes. I think that's something else to keep in mind we quote the yields.","The retail is about $3,000 a foot in terms of basis. And in terms of projected rents, we think the market for this deal is about in the $180 range \u2013 $180 a foot range on the retail and that's blended across the basement, the sub-basement, the main floor and second level and about $115 a foot on the residential component.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, now that...","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","That's a rough outline in terms of the economics. Obviously, this is a location and asset that we think is going to be absolutely at the top of the market, and while the economics are thin or thinner than we had anticipated, just given what's happened kind of in the direction of rents and construction costs over the last couple of years, we did think just maintaining control really enhanced our flexibility.","To maximize an optimal time, just given that what you often see obviously in Manhattan and then some of the best locations in Manhattan. Evaluations could be more volatile and spike here. And so, we think it's important to maintain that flexibility so that we might have the opportunity to monetize at some point down the road and not have to worry about partner consents or secured debt being in place that might create additional friction cost to making the right capital allocation decision.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","That is helpful, Tim. And then the 100 \u2013 and I think you said $150 rents on the residential side.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","$115.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","$115, sorry. Where \u2013 are there already competing buildings in the market at that price point? And how do you guys feel about getting that type of rent in a market where it seems like the high end is maybe under a little bit of pressure in New York?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, I am going to go and turn to Sean, there are a few comps that are I think probably, particularly relevant.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Nick, it's Sean. As Tim pointed out, one thing to keep in mind here is the average unit size is a little bit bigger. It's about 1,100 feet for this deal, spread across studios all the way up to three bedroom units and above. So, in terms of current comps though, I mean the assets that probably come to mind most frequently for people and for our teams, what we've looked at are spread around, but probably three that I'd mentioned most specifically are like Grand Tier, which is at Broadway and 64th; The Corner, which is Broadway and 71st, and then the Brewster, which is 86th between Columbus and Central Park West.","If you go look at those on a unit-by-unit basis and it just sort of reflect our mix, they are basically at rents that we're expecting to achieve for Columbus Circle and obviously we have better location in our view and for product that will be brand new 2.5 years from now. So, we feel pretty good about the rent based on what we see today. And beyond, when you look at the Central Park West sort of that kind of location, not a lot of products in the pipeline as compared to other submarkets within Manhattan like Midtown West as an example or going over to Brooklyn even, so feel pretty good about the rent based on what we're seeing.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, and then sticking in New York, Brooklyn and Long Island City, what are your thoughts about performance of those submarkets for your portfolio this year given some of the supply underway right now?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes. So, for Brooklyn, there's certainly more supply coming in 2017 versus 2016, it's about doubling. We really have one stabilized asset in Brooklyn and Fort Greene, which has been performing fine. Most of the supply that's come into Brooklyn didn't come until basically the third quarter, so we did expect 2017 should be softer than 2016.","That being said, it hasn't impacted performance much at our lease up there at Willoughby, we probably accelerated our lease up a bit at Willoughby just in anticipation of the supply that's coming online, but we did 29 leases a month there in the fourth quarter, which is pretty healthy and expect that to continue, January looks pretty solid.","So in terms of Brooklyn, I would say we expect it to be softer, wouldn't see a lot of impact in terms of our same store portfolio given it's one asset. Long Island City, there is more supply coming in there in 2017 as well. It's starting to become a little more concentrated in downtown as opposed to on the water, which is where we are positioned. So the Riverview assets we have there, the two towers have been some of the better performing assets over the last few years in our overall New York portfolio and I would expect as the supply comes online, they'll probably become more middle of the pack is our expectation for 2017.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, everyone.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Just actually continuing on New York, what are your expectations for the more suburban New York portfolio and New Jersey?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Nick, it's Sean. Happy to chat about that a little bit. As you might expect what's happening. We do expect New York City to be the weakest performing market of our broader New York, New Jersey portfolio in 2017. For New York City, the expectation is for revenue growth around 1% and one thing to keep in mind is that represents the assets that we have spread, kind of all throughout the city. We have Morningside Heights, the Bowery, Brooklyn, Long Island City, Midtown West, et cetera. So assets anywhere from $50 a foot up to $80 a foot across those different submarkets as opposed to being all concentrated in one submarket where there is a lot of supply.","But then as you get into the suburban markets, Westchester is closer to 2%, Long Island around 2% and then Northern and Central New Jersey around 2.5%. Certainly the more suburban market outside the core of New York are expected to perform better in 2017 relative to New York City as an example.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, that's helpful. And then, Kevin, in the past sometimes you have included a heat map in terms of cost of capital of \u2013 or desirability of capital between equity, debt and asset sales. So putting equity aside given where the stock is trading relative to NAV, what is the desirability or value of debt versus asset sales today?","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, I think from the standpoint of relative attractiveness both are \u2013 both forms of capital, asset sales and then unsecured debt are still pretty attractively priced today, even certainly on the unsecured debt side borrowing costs have increased a bit in the last three or four months here by about 40 basis points, 50 basis points. Bear in mind on that front, unsecured debt costs are still today roughly where they have been sort of the previous year or two in 2014 and 2015. So, just to give you a sense of it, if we were to do 10-year debt today, we'd probably be able to execute a 10-year bond offering somewhere in the 3.5% range on fresh capital.","As Tim alluded to on the call, we do have $800 million of hedges in place, 10-year forward starting swaps that we would expect to apply to a like amount of bond issuings on the 10-year front over the course of the year here and the \u2013 essentially the treasury rate on that basket of hedges is at 2.28% overall, so favorably priced relative to spot values today. And our borrowing spreads on top of that, which of course are not hedged, historically have been about 135 basis points, today they are about 110 basis points.","So, we think from the standpoint of the unsecured debt market, capital costs are generally still pretty attractive. Given our hedges, we think they will be attractive as well with respect to the 10-year issuance, which we've got planned for this year. And then, Matt, can certainly speak to the asset sale market. But we still think it's an attractive source of funds today, particularly relative to the returns on development that we would be redeploying some of that capital to fund.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Matt, maybe just on that. Have you seen any movement in terms of cap rates or the amount of buyers showing up to bid for assets or the spread between the bid and ask on specific deals?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","I think it's probably too early to tell. Certainly, we \u2013 some of us were out at (30:41) and there was a lot of talk about that. So, I don't think we've seen evidence yet of any material movement in cap rates. We did sell two assets in the fourth quarter; one wholly-owned asset, which closed in October, so kind of before the election, and then there was a fund asset we sold in mid-November. We have a couple of assets that are in marketing now, so we may have more information by the end of the quarter, by next quarter's call, but I think it's probably too early to say.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Just want to go back to one of Tim's comments in the prepared remarks about winding down the land portfolio as we kind of get into the mature stage of the cycle. It's a broad-based question. How do you sort of foresee the next few years playing out in terms of new opportunities arising? And are you seeing imprudent behavior among different developers, different investors in your markets and submarkets that would lead you to believe that those opportunities will be there a little farther down the road?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Rich. You don't know. I would tell you capital has been pretty disciplined. So the level of the stress is \u2013 probably would be somewhat a function of what is happening in the capital markets and the depth of any perhaps economic correction that might occur. Generally you are seeing 2% or 1.5%, 2% supply growth as we have been seeing, that's roughly in line with the kind of job growth that we've been seeing.","So it doesn't \u2013 absent an economic correction, it doesn't seem that things are getting distorted yet, but we are at the point in the cycle, given that capital has cooled a bit multifamily. There is less of a need. There is less transactions that are closing say on an unentitled basis. We historically have tried to make use of land options as much as we can.","We oftentimes have to buy land maybe one to three quarters before we actually put it into production, but with all the entitlements in place and maybe the other half, we are able to close within a, say a quarter of a \u2013 a quarter to start, but you're not seeing, it doesn't seem like you're seeing lot of people sort of get stuck with a lot of land on their balance sheets yet.","So, we just want to be in a position where we've got the liquidity and the balance sheet kind of be first in line when the market turns. We don't think at this point any opportunities where we can buy land, using our liquidity to buy unentitled land, that there is enough of a benefit to do that and until there is distress, as I said, we're going to try to stay light on that, I mean, I think we typically get in trouble in the development game is being long on land at the wrong point in the cycle where you have an illiquid asset that doesn't cash flow, you may have to sit on it for a few years until the cycle returns, I mean that's one of the lessons learned, I think particularly when \u2013 from the private side of the business. But \u2013 so it's hard to say in terms of how much \u2013 what kind of opportunities will be there, but we're obviously just trying to position ourselves to take advantage of once it is \u2013 once (34:13).","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","That is helpful color, thanks. And then final question here. In terms of expense growth in 2017, it looks like you guys are having a lot of good luck on \u2013 within many sort of types of expenses in terms of segmentation, but I think payroll is one that is starting to accelerate maybe to the more worrisome side. Can you talk about how you envision that growing over the next couple years perhaps? And can you talk about the impact of new supply and its impact on wages and payroll and that sort of thing?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Rich, it's Sean. I want to give you just a couple of comments about expense growth for 2017 overall and then address the specific question about payroll. But in terms of 2017 OpEx growth, for us about 60% of the year-over-year increase is really going to be taxes, which we're expecting to grow at about 3.5% in 2017 for our same-store basket. We're also expecting some growth in utilities and payroll, both of those in the 2.5% to 3% range. But we're going to see some offsetting reductions in a couple of areas, one is we're expecting insurance come down a little down, but probably more importantly is we're expecting some reductions in marketing and maintenance due to various sort of cost reduction initiatives that we've had underway. Maybe just mention a couple of those for you, first, as it relates to our prospect portal, we introduced some new functionality late last year to allow our prospects to book tours online, and we went from basically zero booked online to about a third of them booked online in last quarter of the year. And so, we've taken out a significant chunk of cost for call center costs.","So as opposed to booking online, someone may have sent an email or made a phone call that cost anywhere from a $1 to $6 depending on the channel versus essentially marginal cost of zero on the portal. Same thing as it relates to our resident portal, we're up to about 80% of maintenance requests booked online, that takes call center costs down.","So, we're going to take probably more than $0.5 million out of call center costs in 2017, both on the marketing side and on the maintenance side, and then we're starting to see some benefit from our investments we've made over the last two or three years in resilient flooring with less carpet replacement and things like that. So, we're getting some tailwinds from some of those investments that we've made in the past.","As it relates to payroll specifically, certainly seeing a more competitive market, we've been able to hold our own in terms of voluntary turnover below NMHC averages and things of that sort that we watch. But certainly seeing some pressure there, particularly in the more competitive urban submarkets, where there's heavy lease-up activity, and the potentially for community consultants that are leasing apartment homes to jump from one property to the next to make another $1 or $2 an hour.","Fortunately, we have some pretty tenured staff in some of these locations where they've been with us for long time. They've seen this \u2013 had this play before, so to speak. And we've been able to hold turnover rates down, and then also as you may know, we don't have as many urban projects in lease up as maybe some others, so probably getting a little bit of relief there being in the suburbs. But it's certainly an area that we're going to have to keep an eye on and stay competitive, but with other things we have underway in terms of how we're trying to be as efficient as we can, trying to contain payroll growth as much as possible.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","All right. Thanks, Sean.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, it's Austin Wurschmidt here. Good afternoon, rather. In the same-store revenue guidance, the slides that you provided on page 20 and 21, you talked about a stabilization in the second half of the year, perhaps a little bit of an inflection. Can you just talk about what markets you expect will drive the inflection and how you expect that could trend into 2018?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Austin, this is Sean. I can talk a little bit about that. It really is sort of an inflexion point for certain markets in terms of supply starting to fall off as you get into the back half of the year and then certainly as you get into the first half of 2018. To give you some examples, you start to see some softening in deliveries in Boston, Northern Virginia, LA, and San Jose as you get into the third and fourth quarter of 2017, and then it's more meaningful as you get into 2018.","And just one thing to keep in mind is, Tim did mention sort of stabilization as opposed to reacceleration. So, part of that is a function of how we see supply delivering in certain submarkets that are basically our neighborhoods and how it impacts our portfolio. But it's also a function of comps in the third and fourth quarter of 2016 and what's going to happen with occupancy and things like that. So, there is a handful of markets, like I mentioned, and you start to see an abatement of deliveries to a certain degree that we think will start to translate to some stabilization.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great, thanks for the detail there. And then just wanted to focus on occupancy for a minute. You guys have been running at sort of the mid \u2013 low to mid-95% range now for the last several quarters and many of your peers are in that 96% plus range. And you guys had kind of been in that range in years past. So just wondering how you are thinking about occupancy as a lever today and then maybe anything that you are doing different you think from your peers?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, sure, happy to chat about that. Yeah, I think I mean every portfolio is a little bit different, depending on whether you're heavily urban, heavily suburban, different geographies. So for example, New York City tends to run higher typically than Southern California. So I think you have to look at sort of market occupancy across the footprint to determine if you want to be at the higher end or lower end, et cetera. What we have found for our portfolio is that being sort of in the mid 95% range really does optimize rate growth, occupancy is such that we're delivering the best rental revenue growth. And the one thing that you also have to keep in mind is that we're quoting an economic occupancy, which includes various factors, it's not just physical. So physical and economic are a little bit different, it's just something to keep in mind there, but we're comfortable operating sort of in that mid 95% range. As you may have noticed, in the fourth quarter, we picked up about 30 bps on a sequential basis from the third quarter in occupancy. And if I give up a little bit of rate doing that, but that was our expectation going into the fourth quarter. Particularly in certain markets where we saw supply starting to ramp up a little bit more in Q4 and going into Q1 of 2017, but mid 95% is sort of a range we're comfortable with.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. I just want to go back to the development side for a second here. Thanks for the color on Columbus Circle, sounds like that's about 4.5% expected yield. But just trying to get a sense for the other $700 million or so that was started in the quarter. What the expectations on yields are for those assets just given the fairly large decline in the overall pools. Expected yield from 6.4% to 5.9% would suggest that the other starts are sort of sub 5%, but just trying to see if there is anything else in there.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, Vince. This is Matt. I can speak to that one. It is about obviously what goes into the bucket and what goes out of the bucket in any particular quarter. And this quarter we didn't have any completions, we have the five starts, as you noted. The other four, Belltown Towers is a new high-rise in Seattle, that's kind of a high-5% yield basis around $515 a unit after you allocate something for the retail, so we think that's a phenomenal location and a great long-term asset and a strong spread there relative to what that cap rate would be.","We also started a wood frame deal in Emeryville called Public Market, which is a mixed-use project where we will own the residential and we have a retail partner there, that deal is about a 6% yield on today's rents. And that's a deal that \u2013 both of those are land deals that were struck probably two to three years ago, when the land market was not necessarily reflective of where rents went kind of over the intervening two years.","The AVA Hollywood deal, that's a low-5%s yield, basis around $500 a unit there and that's a market where we think there is still strong rent growth in front of it. And then the fifth start was Teaneck, that's kind of low to mid 6%s, mid-rise in suburban North New Jersey. So, the basket as a whole did pull it down, but Columbus Circle would be kind of the outlier.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay, yes, yes, when I do the backwards math it seems like the starts would have to be a little bit lower than we just quoted, unless the existing projects \u2013 did the yields change on those? It seemed like some of the rent per homes did come in for a couple of the projects.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. No, I think, I mean, rents were down just a very small amount on the existing lease-ups, so yields might have ticked down a couple of basis points there, but nothing material. It's more about the basket.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Got it. Okay, okay, and appreciate the breakout between mid-rise, high-rise and garden. But I guess if you think about just the suburban urban definitions that you kind of outlined, how would that break up \u2013 or how would the pipeline break up right now, along those lines.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","In terms of what's currently under construction?","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Right.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","I think it's about almost half and half.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","It is about half and half between suburban and urban in terms of what's currently under construction, (44:50) value perspective.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","We talked about how the starts for this year they are all planned to be suburban. So, it's a very different characteristic. Just to go back, I'm sorry, to the prior question, the other reason why the yield basket would have changed was in last quarter's number we also included some deals that completed in Q3 that fell off in Q4, and those deals had higher yields.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Got it, got it. Thanks. Okay. And then just in terms of the trajectory that you mentioned, you specifically called out Boston, Northern Virginia, San Jose as seeing some slowdown in deliveries to year end. But just broadly speaking I guess, is your demand outlook shifting at all over the course of the year and should we think about the heaviest supply sort of being behind us by the middle of the year broadly speaking?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Vince, this is Sean. In terms of, I guess, the broader way to think about it across our footprint at least is that the supply as a percentage of stock, the footprint is relatively static through the first three quarters, starts to fall off in the fourth quarter and it really starts to fall-off in a more meaningful way in mid-2018. The composition among the markets does shift from quarter-to-quarter. So, while you might see a modest deceleration in Q3 and Q4, some are up, some are down, the ones that I mentioned previously are the ones that are down in such a way that it starts to impact our portfolio more in the second half of the year, that's why I highlighted that.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Got it. Okay. And the demand side we should be thinking about is relatively stable?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","I think though \u2013 yeah, I mean, if you look at it, job growth Tim talked about, we're expecting job growth to be similar to 2016 levels and depending on which market you are thinking about, there is a lot of different perspectives in terms of the potential for upside or downside. There's a lot of discussion about deregulation and the potential impact on financial services in New York, but people are also concerned about how long can Microsoft and Amazon be the anchors in Seattle. So, each market \u2013 there's probably commentary for each one in terms of the pros and cons on that job growth outlook.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks guys.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","And maybe just one thing to add, I mean, demand of course tends to be seasonal as well. So you would generally expect demand to be stronger in the middle of the year relative to the end of the year. That generally gets reflected in average rent growth.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. Sticking with the job picture, it looks like you guys are forecasting that 20 bps decline and your forecast for business is quite strong. So are you seeing any structural issue, just not enough high \u2013 college educated employees to take those jobs? Or is it election uncertainty that's causing you to taper back your forecast this year?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. This is \u2013 Wes, Tim here. I think it's really a function of availability of labor when you are looking at unemployment starting to mark towards the low 4% and as you know, for college grads it's probably more in the 2.5% range, which is the majority of our portfolio and our markets tend to be more college educated in general. So, I think, it's as much as \u2013 it's probably being driven more by that just the availability of labor than anything else.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Now looking at 11 West, you guys booked that JV in the asset. Do you expect maybe at some point this year to revisit that? Or is the bid\/ask too wide, you just want to de-risk the project some more?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","No, unless sentiment changed a lot so that it started to impact the market's view of value. I think right now there is just \u2013 when you're looking at high-end residential and the street retail, the market sentiment has been as chilly as it has been in probably anytime this cycle. So, I just don't anticipate \u2013 we don't anticipate that turning around, we just think that is sort of the wrong environment to capitalize or sell a part of a project.","So, it's one of the benefits of having a great balance sheet and plenty of liquidity that you're not forced to sort of capitalize or sell into the face of potentially a declining market or poor market sentiment or declining market sentiment. So I suspect we'll \u2013 it's probably something \u2013 it will be revisited when we see, maybe as I mentioned in prepared remarks maybe a little bit more spikier kind of valuations and we'll just see it as a more opportunistic time to transact.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for the time. Just curious what changed with regards to your outlook on supply now being more comfortable saying 2017 would be the peak versus kind of comments at NAREIT in November? What kind of \u2013 what did you get your head around where you feel comfortable making that statement at this point?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Juan, this is Sean. I can take that one and then Tim rather you can speak to it as well. I mean, we refresh our pipeline essentially every quarter and it gets a good scrub at year end as we take a look at what's been capitalized, what hasn't et cetera. So, what we've experienced in the past is that, and this is maybe what we alluded at NAREIT is the construction duration on what has been built this cycle, particularly in some of the markets like San Francisco and New York, it's urban and it's high rise, it's a different construction cycle, there is more risk involved in an execution what we have seen is typically that, a number of those deals end up getting delayed into the subsequent year for a variety of reasons.","So, what we try to do is estimate as best we can given the data that we have from third-party sources, from our internal teams, both operations and development, permit data, et cetera and then handicap it. So based on what we see today, our expectation is as I alluded to earlier, but certainly there is still some risk that given the nature of the product being developed that some of it slips into 2018.","Similar to what we saw in terms of some of the 2016 completions slipping into 2017. Our initial expectation for 2016 deliveries was higher than where we actually ended up. And that may be the case for 2017 as well, just too early to tell.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great, thanks. And then just wanted to circle back on sort of the cap rate questions that have been asked around New York specifically. It seems like a part of the reason you decided not to JV the Columbus Circle was just a widening of the spreads there. Can you help us quantify kind of what that delta has been or could potentially be given the bid\/ask spread or for high-end apartment core assets?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Juan, to be clear, I don't know that we've seen movement in cap rates, we just \u2013 there hasn't been much in the way of trade. I think there is a different view around \u2013 sentiment around risk and development risk, and what that might command in terms of a risk premium, but Columbus Circle, as I mentioned it's not a 421a deal, I mean it doesn't have a pilot \u2013 it doesn't have \u2013 so it has fully loaded taxes, which tend to impact cap rate, it doesn't have affordables, which might impact cap rate. So this deal, to the extent that it traded in the market, it will trade at the very, very low end.","I can't think of an asset that would trade at a lower cap rate. So, even in today's market, if we took this to market, we think it would be probably in the low 3%s. And then on the retail side, the other part of it was that when we took \u2013 when we went to market, we just \u2013 there was interest at a reasonable value, but the kind of commitment that people \u2013 that organizations were able or willing to make against the forward obligation to take out the retail upon completion, we didn't think sort of justify the risk. For instance we \u2013 the market was telling us that maybe we get a $10 million to $15 million to $20 million deposit against what might be a couple hundred million dollar obligation.","And so at the end of the day just we felt sort of the risk-reward of that from the seller standpoint just didn't justify sort of stepping into that kind of transaction and felt we'd be better off owning it through construction ourselves, and then ultimately start to capture some of the development profit maybe at some point down the road.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and just lastly if I could ask about San Francisco, about your view on rent growth in 2017 across the different submarkets and at what point do those markets trough, if at all, in 2017?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Juan, this is Sean. In terms of Northern California, and San Francisco specifically, we are expecting it to be pretty weak in San Francisco all year, the weakest of the three markets within Northern California when you consider performance in San Jose, Oakland, and San Francisco.","In terms of our revenue outlook, we're expecting the East Bay to be strongest, roughly 3%, San Jose probably around 2%, and San Francisco lagging considerably probably between 25 basis points and 50 basis points, in terms of revenue performance. And we're really not expecting much rate growth there at all in San Francisco, sub 1% certainly as you get into \u2013 get through 2017 based on the supply that's pretty leveled throughout 2017, doesn't really trail off until you get into 2018?","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good afternoon. So on Columbus Circle the development is not branded as an Avalon product, is that by design?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","It is actually...","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Matt, go ahead, I'm sorry.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","This is Matt. We haven't made a final decision on that. We're still a couple of years away from leasing it, but given the rent levels and frankly the service level, while Avalon is our flagship brand and kind of highest level product and service experience, we do expect this to be a level above anything that you would find in a typical Avalon and so there is brand equity in the Avalon name, I think, particularly in New York, but it is a pretty unique and special product offering and it may be that it merits kind of its own brand identity.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And so, the yield you are expecting on a stabilized basis is not going to be as earnings accretive as your other developments. But you did mention the cap rate would be lower in the market. So are you basically saying that you are planning to sell the asset or joint venture the asset once it is complete?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","John, not necessarily. I think what I was saying, this kind of location, this kind of asset, it just \u2013 there can be opportunities to take advantage of sometimes a market where somebody else has a very low cost of capital, maybe it's a sovereign that just has to own the best asset in the market and we have to be responsive to that if those opportunities arise. And I think particularly when you are looking at a trophy asset like this. So, I think it's just the recognition that by controlling it, it just gives us a lot of flexibility. We have two pieces here, residential could potentially be converted to condominium at $2,000 a foot, it's a pretty good basis for that location and it's going to be at a I think a pretty high level finish.","We're talking about 10 feet ceilings for instance, which is unusual in a rental offering, and retail floor plates that are around 20,000 square feet, again pretty unusual in that part of the city. And so, they just recognize by having control it just gives us optionality and the best option at some point maybe selling a piece of it or all of it at some point.","So, it's really about unlike a lot of our portfolio, which are \u2013 when you think about just kind of long-term kind of core hold that the sort of asset valuation doesn't necessarily fluctuate as much as it might at the very high end.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","On your development pipeline and the breakdown between high-rise and mid to low-rise, can you provide that same breakdown on your development rights?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","No, it's mostly \u2013 it's very little high-rise, in fact, I'm not sure there is any high-rise. I think it's been \u2013 I think at this point high rise has pretty been cleared. It's almost entire \u2013 it's mostly until mid-rise with some suburban garden. Matt, I think you actually have a more detailed breakdown.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. As of the end of the year here, our development rights 10% were garden, 70% were mid-rise, and 20% were high-rise, but that's really almost completely or maybe just the East 96th Street deal, which is public-private partnership, which is we've talked about in the past is still a few years away from starting.","So, it is heavily weighted towards that, mid-rise kind of infill, suburban, and again that's kind of all of our starts in 2017 are either garden's or mid-rises and actually our projected yield on today's underwriting on our 2017 starts is actually in the high 6s. So it will start to pull that average back up.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, if you include East 96, it seems like your urban\/suburban mix on the development rights is about the same as your current development pipeline?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","No. No. The current development rights are about one-third urban, whereas the current under construction is actually 60% urban.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right, okay. And then on page 18 of your presentation you discuss how the Pacific Northwest and Northern California are expected to have the highest amount of personal income growth next year or this year. How much does this impact your ability to push rents if that somehow drops off a little bit?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes. It impacts purchasing power. I mean when there is more income in a catchment area and housing is one of the biggest expenses of any consumer, the more income they have. They tend to allocate a reasonably sort of stable level, a percentage of their income to housing. So at the end of the day, as long as demand and supply are roughly in line, what drives our business is really \u2013 it's really income growth and it's one of the reasons why places like Seattle and Northern California, in particularly this cycle have dramatically outperformed. When you look at sort of the quality of jobs and the level of wage growth that we've seen and kind of innovation knowledge based centers.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Sean, on page 20 of the slide deck, where you've got your same store growth, most of this candle sticks look all to be the same size to me. I mean when you think about it, which markets have the greatest potential, variability operations wise this year, between the possible range of outcomes?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Rob. I mean, I'd say it's probably the markets where you are seeing more significant supply, combined with a job base that tends to be probably more volatile just based on its history. So, certainly San Francisco, we have dialed that in where we think it should be based on all of our history, but it's the tech factor, it can be volatile, we've got a baseline, but we know what the supply is and if the demand doesn't show up where we expected, you could see more deterioration there. But on the other side of the coin, some people are calling for potential reacceleration of job growth there later this year, it could go that way.","I'd say probably there in New York are the two places New York City specifically, where you could see that that have the most significant impact on our portfolio, given our allocation. You could also say the same thing about Seattle and my comments earlier related to Microsoft and Amazon, but it's only about 6% of the portfolio, so it's not going to move the needle on a material way, given how much we have allocated there.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. How close are you guys to signing an anchor tenant on the retail or anchor tenants at Columbus Circle?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","This is Matt. We have not really started marketing it in earnest yet. I think we will be at ICSC in May, so we're really just now at the point that we're ready to start engaging in those discussions and we have brokers on board, so more to come over time.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And then just lastly, either Kevin or Sean, what do you guys think is the appropriate level in 2017 for recurring but non-revenue producing CapEx per unit?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Rob, it's Sean. In terms of CapEx, we came in around $900 a unit in 2016, and for CapEx in 2017, we're expecting it to tick up some to maybe about $1,000 a unit, about 5% of NOI.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Just two really quick ones. You mentioned New York and San Francisco I think as being your sort of most volatile markets. But just curious on the concession side from what you are seeing in the landscape, would you also say that those are the two markets where you see the most amount of concessionary competition? Or are there other markets that flag up for heavy concessions, but aren't having an impact on your operations?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Alex, it's Sean. The Northern Cal market is the majority of the concession activity for us on a stabilized basis. It's about \u2013 in Q4, as an example, it was about 60% of the cash concessions we issued. In New York, where you're going to see that is all the lease-ups. There's not a lot of concessioning on the stabilized assets at this point. You'll see a little bit here and there certainly depending on which submarkets you're in.","But for the most part it's ramp it across all the lease-up assets regardless to which submarket that you're falling in just given the nature of the ramp regulations and the policies there in New York City. So, but for the most part from a market perspective on stabilized assets, you're seeing it in Northern California.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then the second question is, as you guys morph towards more of your starts being in the suburbs are you seeing more competitor developers coming back into the suburbs? Or is that still pretty muted for all the aforementioned reasons whether it's the difficulty in labor, land or getting construction financing?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Alex. It is Tim. I mean, you've seen a pickup probably over the last two or three years, but as I mentioned in my remarks, it's still on the order of half as much. I think we expect that to persist at least as it relates to deliveries, over the next several quarters. We're seeing roughly \u2013 our markets \u2013 if we're expecting 2% of total supply growth, this maybe on the order 1.5% in the suburbs and closer to high 2%, almost 3%, in the urban submarkets.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. So, Tim, as you look over the next sort of 12 months to 24 months, you don't see more developers coming into your suburbs, you still see it as muted.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. We actually, as we mentioned, we do expect supply \u2013 the deliveries to fall in 2018, but pretty commensurately between \u2013 proportionally between urban and suburban. We expect suburban supply to be on the order of 1.25%, maybe in 2018 and urban from about 2.8% to about 2.3% in 2018. So, drop of about 1.5% to 1.2% on the suburban submarkets and from about 2.8% to 2.3% on the urban markets. So pretty proportionate.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thanks, Tim.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Tim, I know it's maybe a little early to ask this, but with just the moderation in land inventory how should we think about the potential for starts in 2018 compared to the volume you are expecting this year? I am just curious if you expect that could level out or just later into the cycle as you discussed in your management letter. Should we expect maybe further pullback in starts?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Jeff. As it relates to 2018, as I mentioned, we have about $3 billion in the development right pipeline that tends to be kind of deals that are going to start over the \u2013 with the exception of maybe East 96th, but tend to be deals that are going to start over the next three years or so.","So, I don't think you'll see a $1.6 over the next few years. I do think it's likely to be in the $800 million to a $1 billion range, just based upon deals that we can identify today, that are just going to take another 12 months to 20 months to get going.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's useful. And then I guess, Kevin, maybe can you just talk about some of the major variables that bring you to the top or bottom of the guidance range for 2017? I am just curious if it's capital markets activity, development stabilizations or maybe some of your same-store metrics?","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, I think the biggest variable there is just going to be performance in terms of same-store, that's the biggest driver obviously of our NOI and FFO. The capital side of the equation could be an issue but, as I mentioned earlier, we've got against the $1.7 billion of net external capital we anticipate raising this year, we have $800 million in hedges in place that are mapped against the 10-year debt issuance that we expect to have this year.","So probably not as many variables overall as there otherwise would be outside of community operations.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And for the contribution that is coming from the development stabilizations, I am just curious, how have the assumptions around that changed maybe in the last three, six, nine months? Just \u2013 have you guys kind of altered maybe your lease up velocity or sort of concessions? I am just curious what might have shifted in your expectations.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, in terms of lease up velocity and that type of thing, hasn't really changed materially. I think the contribution really depends on the mix of assets, which markets they're in, et cetera from year-to-year, but Tim indicated in his prepared remarks, it's pretty similar between 2016 and 2017 in terms of the contribution from the external growth platform.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And just maybe one last question for you, Sean. I recognize that supply is expected to be maybe higher into accelerating the Pacific Northwest for example or the mid-Atlantic. But as you look across your portfolios, in which cities and submarkets do you see the greatest overlap between the product coming online and your actual assets in \u2013 your own assets in the submarket?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, that's probably a few minute discussion to go through, kind of submarket by submarket. I'm happy to do that with you maybe offline, so that we don't run the call too long, if you like to go through kind of market-by-market assessment.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Happy to do it. Thanks.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Just in terms of expenses, there has been I guess some increasing dialog about rising construction costs, primarily due to a lack of available skilled labor. I was curious how much of that is baked into your forecast and how are you thinking about that?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Rich, this is Matt. You're talking specifically about construction costs and development costs?","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, primarily construction costs related to lack of availability of people that know how to do things.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I mean we've certainly seen pressure in our construction budgets as deals go through our pipeline from development right to development community. When we start a community and we report it as a development community, at that point, we have what we call Class 3 budget and that is based on bid coverage on almost all of the major trades and usually a pretty significant amount of the total budget has already been bought out by that point. So, what you see is, there is usually not a lot of variability or not a lot of risk in, whether we'll be able to deliver the project on the budget once it starts. The risk for us is probably more in the deals that haven't started yet that if we underwrote, we felt the hard costs a year ago were going to be x, and now that might be x plus something.","And if NOI hasn't grown to cover that, then we might have some erosion in the economics. And that is a risk. And that also speaks to what Tim's talking about, about how we manage our land positions and most of the land we're controlling at this point, the vast majority of those 25 development rights is on land that we have under longer-term purchase contracts, very little of it do we own given the starts that we have last quarter.","So, there is some exposure there. I will say, what we've seen is hard cost growth in most of our markets, it's still rising faster than rents, but not by perhaps the same margin as it was a year ago. So, hard cost growth is not \u2013 and again that's a reflection of the fact that start activity is starting to stabilize and perhaps the next leg is down. So, hard costs are still rising, but they are not rising as aggressively, the question is will NOIs keep up.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Got it, that's helpful, thank you. Back to your presentation on page 17 of the presentation. I always like the charts that you guys provide. I was maybe curious, maybe even a little bit surprised about the comment that housing demand is more balanced. I take that to mean housing demand itself is not relative to multi-family, right? Because I guess our thoughts are that maybe the homeownership rate has stabilized but we don't see it really going higher. So I was curious if you are seeing sort of the same things.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think we're saying the same thing. Homeownership rate in 63% range is starting to stabilize and that's what we really meant. The fact that it's stabilizing is evidence that we're seeing more balanced housing demand between for sale and rental. Whereas, obviously, earlier this cycle virtually all net new household formation was rental. We saw the opposite early in the 2000s and in my remarks I had mentioned, it's about as balanced as we're seeing since 2000, 2001. And that was not \u2013 that was the norm for the 30 years before 2000. It hasn't been the norm in the last 15 years. But increasingly when you look at demographics, and kind of look at the distortions that have sort of been wrung out of the market, we think we're just going to see a more balanced housing picture. I think a lot of people are still calling for the homeownership rates to tick down a little bit, but we're operating under the assumption that we're seeing some normalization right now.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, that's consistent with our view. I am curious, are there any markets that you operate in where you might be seeing more housing demand than you were expecting. Or is it pretty much the same trend nationwide?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Rich, it's Sean. I mean for the most part if you're talking about customers leaving our communities to go purchase homes, now pretty much across all the markets, it's well below long-term averages. The only one that is sort of running at long-term averages is in New England, people are buying homes at a consistent rate, at least consistent with long-term averages, all the other markets, it's still well below long-term averages.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. I appreciate it. Nothing else for me.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Hey, thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Maybe we can talk about the fourth quarter a little bit and tell us what, if you could, what your renewal and new lease figures were; and then maybe what so far in January in 2017. And then I have a follow-up, please.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, Ivy. This is Sean. In terms of the fourth quarter numbers, blended rent change was 1.3%, which is a reflection of renewals at 4.7% and new move-ins down 2.25%. And then as we get into the January, it's around 80 basis points move-ins similar to the fourth quarter, but renewals were down to about 3.5%.","And then if you look forward in the renewal offers, they're running around 6% for February and March, so starting to accelerate relative to the last few months and more consistent with the trends we saw last year.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates","And just to follow on that assumption for 2017, as you recognize some of the pressure from supply and assumingly through the first three quarters, what assumptions are you using for concessions in your forecast for renewals?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, for renewal specifically?","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Specifically, yes, because as consumers recognize that rents are down in places like New York and other more competitive markets, I assume that there is something baked in that there will be concessions for those renewals to keep those tenants in the occupancy rate.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes. Typically for us and for most, we don't do really concessions for renewals. The question is what the rate you're going to get? And so, for example, if we are making renewal offers at 6% for February and March, those probably going to settle maybe in the high-4%s as an example, so there is a little spread there in terms of what you negotiate to versus the original offer. Concessions really come into play on new leases.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates","No, actually I apologize. I apologize, I meant recognizing what you are going to give them in concession on rate. I'm saying the absolute rate. So is it you pressuring it 2%, 200 basis points? So I appreciate that is not an actual concession.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, the range is normally around 110 basis points or so. I would expect it potentially be a little bit wider this year. So, as I mentioned, it might be 125 basis points, so if we're going out at 6%, maybe it's coming in at 4.75% or so, in terms of where they settle out. That number does move around quite a bit, but I'd say in the long-term, it typically is spread of about 110 bps between what your initial offer is and where it settles out, and what you actually get.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Okay.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","So, that's how to think about it for renewals.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Great. And then just lastly with respect to the back half of the year and appreciating your assumptions that you are making on employment and wage growth; do you have any sense in variability if employment growth is not, let's say, what it has been running in 2016, and it's something less than that? Like how much of a range and\/or wage growth is dependent on achieving your expectations for 2017 within the assumptions?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Ivy, it's Tim. I can't tell you the exact sensitivity to the model, but as I sort of think about it kind of simplistically, if personal income growth is growing by roughly 5% in your markets and you're adding supply at 2 to 1, all things being equal, again not all things are equal, but to the extent you have a relatively balanced housing demand picture, which we do relative to recent years, that ought to equate into somewhere in the 2.5% to 3% same store revenue growth from our perspective.","So, as people are spending \u2013 assuming people spend around a relatively stable percentage of their income on housing. Now those trends tend to sort of follow kind of on a more multi-year basis than they might in one quarter or a couple of quarter time period. So, I don't want it sounds overly precise, but that's why we generally \u2013 we only see negative, really consistently negative rental rate growth when we're in a period of recession, when you're actually seeing job declines and income declines in the face of \u2013 even though in the face of no new housing deliveries.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Got it. Okay, guys, good luck. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Good afternoon. Just a couple from me. Just given the comments about supply and, again, deliveries starting to slow down in the back half of 2017 going into 2018, and some of your thoughts around demand. Could you just give us a sense of how you expect \u2013 what kind of same-store NOI growth you are generally expecting on a quarterly basis? Is the idea it is going to be tough in the first half and improve in the second half? Is it going to be better in the first half and tough in the second half?","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I mean Tayo, I think the chart that we provided on slide 21 gives you a sense of sort of trajectory of revenue growth throughout the year, starting a little bit stronger in the earlier part of the year and then trailing off and stabilizing as we get into the back half. Expenses are pretty choppy, so we provide a full year number, but the timing of tax appeals, insurance claims, things like that generally result in volatility from quarter-to-quarter that we try not to predict too much, because we generally will get it wrong in terms of the timing of the appeals and things like that. So payroll maintenance, the other things we can project pretty well, but those things create some volatility from quarter-to-quarter that we typically try not to provide much guidance on.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Got you. That's helpful. And then in regard to some of your new development starts in \u2013 construction starts in fourth quarter, could you talk specifically about the Seattle and New York projects? And again, what I'm kind of looking for is there are some concerns about supply in that market. I am just trying to get a sense of where these two assets are relative to where some of the supply hotspots may be in both markets.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, Tayo, it's Matt. The Seattle asset is in Belltown, so it's kind of on the Northern edge of downtown, that is a sub-market, in general there is a lot of supply in downtown Seattle, so unlike say our East Side development communities, which are currently in lease-up, which are enjoying a little bit less competition, that is in the fray. Having said that, it's kind of on the North side of it, so it's a little bit removed from where kind of the heart of all the supply is and it's not going to deliver for two years. So, by that time, it should be coming on the back side of that wave of supply, but certainly, that is going to be competitive sub-market.","The West 61st Street by comparison one of the things that we have loved about that place from the beginning is, it is a very unique and special location and there is not a lot of supply coming there, particularly if you look out two years, it should have almost nothing to compete with, now there is going to be supply in Hudson Yards, there is going to be supply in other parts of Manhattan and to the extent, it's a kind of regional market, obviously there is competition there, but for folks that want to live in that neighborhood, with access to the schools, with access to that environment, all the amenities, cultural amenities, everything that's there, we think that actually we should be pretty well positioned in terms of the timing of when that's going to deliver.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Got you. And then for some of the other starts during the quarter, any of them close to supply hotspots or no?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Not really, I mean, you look at public market, there's not a whole lot in the East Bay, which again, East Bay has held-up better partially because of that, so we like Emeryville.","Hollywood is an area that is getting a reasonable amount of supply. Obviously, we're delivering in West Hollywood, which is about a mile away this year. So that's a market that's going to continue to be competitive, but a very, very deep market there, and that's at a more \u2013 not at the kind of price point that say, relative to its sub-market, let's say Belltown or Columbus Circle would be.","And Teaneck, there continues to be very limited supply, once you get-off the Gold Coast into New Jersey, once you're in land, that market continues to be very solid and steady for us, and we continue to deliver, beat our performance on the New Jersey stuff, partially because of that.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Good afternoon. Matt, earlier you mentioned that you haven't seen cap rates move, and I want to be clear that was a commentary in recent months. Could you comment on the level at all that you have seen them move in the last year? And if they haven't moved, is that an indication to you that people are willing to accept lower expected returns?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure. I guess, what I'd say is, I think over the last year, they've been relatively flat. And I think, your all numbers, I think show that at least in terms of CPPI. Underneath that overall bucket, I mean what you hear is that maybe they're up a little bit on kind of core stuff. There's still every bit probably as low on value-add, where there's more capital chasing less assets. So the composition of it might have changed a little bit.","I think you're right in the sense that people probably are underwriting softer rent or NOI growth than they would have been a year or two ago, so if cap rates haven't moved then, presumably they are accepting lower underwritten IRRs, so that's why I say, it remains to be seen, not a lot of deals have been struck since the latest move up in interest rates. So, there is talk that there might be a little bit of a bid-ask spread on some of the core stuff and that's why, some of that stuff isn't trading as much yet. But, so there is a dynamic, there's still a lot of capital looking to get out, albeit underwriting is probably not as aggressive as it was. And I don't think there are sellers that really need to sell assets, so it's going to be interesting to see how that dynamic plays out.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Conor, maybe just to add to that. I know based on how we underwrite assets, when we look at residual cap rates, it's really not that much of a function what's happening currently, because we're looking out whatever 10 years, 15 years, 20 years depending upon the pro forma you're on, it's really more of a function of kind of normalized levels of interest rates and cap rates. So, I think to the extent that the market and my sense is, you are seeing more of that \u2013 to the extent the market assumed that you would expect maybe asset values to fluctuate a little less and just in terms of our underwriting and how we think about the value of our assets, it hasn't changed much over the last year.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay, thank you. Then, Tim, a follow-up. Your presentation you give a fairly optimistic view of the economy with business confidence, consumer confidence increasing. So in that environment and if you are also forecasting for stabilization or re-acceleration of rent growth, do you think that that would once again make development more attractive? So how long do you think that the debt side can be a constraint on development either stabilizing or re-accelerating?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, that's asking me to project behavior, I guess the side of it that we had \u2013 you didn't bring up really is what's going on in the construction cost side. So the margins aren't what they have been, just mainly because of what's going on the construction side.","So that alone plus I just think regulated behavior. That tends not to change overnight. We'll see whether new administration changes that, but you talked to banks. I mean the one thing they're definitive about is we're not making \u2013 we're not accommodating multifamily capital requests like we were a couple of years ago and part of that is just the regulators leaning on them. So I think there is other factors that play just in terms of just kind of the pure economics of the business, but I think you make a fair point.","I mean to the extent that it's still a profitable business, it's going to attract some capital and we don't see it going from 2% to 0.5%, which it happened in cycles in the past. I think it is likely to go down may be into the 1.5% range over the next two or three years, but even in our markets, which tend to be a little bit more supply constrained, not as much as cycled because of what's happened on the urban side, but I don't anticipate seeing the same kind of drop-off that we've seen may be in past cycles.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to the company for any additional or closing remarks.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, Noah. I think we've been on for a while, so we try to respect people's time and thank everybody for joining us today and remarkably I think we'll see a number of you in just a few weeks. Thank you and have a good day.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Jason Reilley, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley","Thank you, Matthew, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with the forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially.

This attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during your review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Tim Naughton, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton","Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our second quarter call. Joining me today are Sean Breslin, EVP of Investments and Asset Management; and Tom Sargeant, our Chief Financial Officer. We each have some prepared remarks and then the 3 of us will be available for questions.","I'll start by addressing our financial and operating results for the quarter, as well as our current assessment of apartment fundamentals. Sean will then provide some color on portfolio performance and transaction activity for the quarter. Tom will discuss recent capital markets activity and our updated financial outlook for the year, and I'll finish up our prepared remarks with an update on development activity and how the development platform is projected to enhance growth and net asset value as the cycle matures.","Starting with financial and operating results for the quarter. Last night, we reported FFO per share of $1.34, which is up over 18% from the same quarter last year and represents the fourth consecutive quarter of approximately 18% growth in FFO per share. Overall, operating performance for 2012 continues to track largely as expected, and Q2 quarterly FFO beat the midpoint of our guidance by $0.02 per share, primarily due to lower-than-expected community operating expenses. Of this $0.02, about half relates to savings and utilities expense and office operations, while the remaining half is timing related.","Q2 revenue performance was in line with expectations. For the quarter, earnings growth was driven by strong operating performance from our existing portfolio, as well as the delivery and lease-up of newly developed communities. For our same-store portfolio, year-over-year revenue growth was 5.8% and NOI growth was 7.1%. Revenue growth was healthy in all of our regions, with the strongest revenue growth coming, once again, from Northern California and Seattle.","Turning to fundamentals. Operating performance continues to benefit from healthy demand-supply fundamentals despite the recent downshift in economic activity and job growth that occurred in Q2. While job growth moderated last quarter, rental housing demand is benefiting from declining homeownership, increasing household formation and strong demographic trends. In addition, the supply of newly completed apartment homes remains below historical averages experienced over the last 2 decades and significantly below the '70s and '80s when demographics were last still favorable for multifamily housing.","Looking more closely at employment, job growth in the U.S. has been moderate and uneven, thus far, in 2012 with strong growth of 225,000 jobs per month in Q1, followed by slower growth of about 75,000 per month in Q2. These results put the U.S. nearly on pace with initial third-party forecasts of about 1.5% or 2 million new jobs in 2012. However, for the third consecutive year, renewed concern over European fiscal and banking challenges and the recent focus on the U.S. fiscal situation appeared to have weakened business and consumer confidence, reduced the rate of economic growth and tempered hiring activity. Looking ahead, while many economists now project slower growth in the second half of 2012, most continue to expect the U.S. to remain on a moderate growth trajectory over the next several years, generating around 1.5% to 2% job growth or over 2 million jobs per year from 2013 through 2015, including about 600,000 jobs annually for the prime rental cohort of 20- to 34-year-olds.","For AvalonBay's markets, job growth has kept pace with national trends, with Northern California and Seattle exceeding expectations, with growth in the 2.5% to 3% range, and Southern California and the peripheral markets outside of New York, such as Long Island, Fairfield County and Northern New Jersey falling below expectations at less than 1%.","Looking at other dynamics affecting demand, the apartment sector continues to benefit from a decline in homeownership, which now stands at 65.5% nationally and is down 370 basis points from the peak. This trend is even more pronounced across the AVB's footprint as the average homeownership rate in our markets was down 560 basis points from peak and now stands at just over 55%. Despite the significant reduction in housing prices we've seen across the U.S. over the last few years, affordability remains an issue in many of our markets as the average home price to income ratio is at 5.6x or roughly 75% higher than the U.S. average of 3.2x.","In our markets, we see little evidence so far of increased strength in for-sale housing other than maybe Boston and Seattle, where there was an uptick this quarter of move-outs for home purchases. Overall, for our portfolio, move-outs related to home purchase remain well below long-term averages. Currently stands at 14.5%, which is up only marginally from the same quarter last year.","In addition to falling homeownership, rental housing demand has benefited from improvement in the rate of household formation, which experienced a year-over-year increase of 1 million households in Q1, the largest increase since 2006. And while household growth has improved recently, it is still below the longer-term average of around 1.4 million. In fact, many economists have projected that the lower level of net household formation experienced over the last 5 years has resulted in pent-up demand on the order of 1.5 million to 2 million households, with many of these figuring to be in the 25- to 34-year-old prime renter cohort, as this age group has almost 1.5 million more people living at home than historical trends would suggest.","As this pent-up demand materializes, it should provide additional stimulus for our broader housing recovery. We believe a recovery that creates rising demand for housing will be similar to the recovery in the mid-90s, in which both the for sale sector and multifamily rental sector benefited from increasing household formation and rising demand, and that a recovery for sale housing will likely proceed along a gradual path in most markets, anchored both by more prudent lending standards and more cautious consumers.","Turning to new supply. Completions in our markets remain below historical norms at approximately 0.8% of apartment stock in 2012 as compared with the 15-year average of around 1.0%. The D.C. Metro area is our only market with above-average levels of new completions in 2012 with 7,000 new homes, representing 1.8% of apartment stock concentrated in the back half of the year.","Looking into 2013, completions are projected to rise towards 15-year averages in most markets. However, new deliveries of multifamily housing stock will still be at levels at around half that experienced in the '70s and '80s or during the period when the baby boom came of age and multifamily housing demand last benefited from a strong demographic tailwind.","As a result, the last 15 to 20 years may not be the best benchmark when evaluating levels of supply that might be absorbed over the next few years. Given demographic trends and the resulting changes in housing preferences, it would be reasonable to conclude that absorption of multifamily rental supply will be stronger than what was experienced over the last 2 decades. Nevertheless, we will see elevated supply in a few markets, particularly Metro D.C., San Jose and Seattle. Of these markets, strong job growth in Seattle and San Jose should provide adequate demand to absorb new deliveries plus employment forecast for the Metro D.C. area suggests deliveries may result in weaker apartment fundamentals and operating performance relative to the balance of our portfolio.","So in summary, despite an expected slower pace of growth in the second half of 2012, apartment fundamentals on balance remain healthy and are expected to remain favorable through a combination of modest economic recovery and improvement in household formation, compelling demographics and reasonable levels of new supply. These trends were reflected in our updated 2012 outlook in which we increased the midpoint of the range by $0.06 per share and are now projecting annual growth in FFO per share of almost 20% this year.","With that, I'll pass it to Sean, who will provide color on our operating performance and transaction activity.","Sean J. Breslin","Thanks, Tim. As Tim mentioned, I will make some comments about the trends in portfolio performance and then shift to the transaction market and our specific acquisition and disposition activity.","Turning first to portfolio performance. Same-store NOI for the second quarter increased 7.1% on a year-over-year basis, driven by revenue growth of 5.8% and operating expense growth of 3%. On a sequential basis, Q2 same-store revenue increased 1.5%, reflecting continued positive momentum in apartment fundamentals with a 1.8% increase in rental rates, offset by a 30 basis points reduction in economic occupancy.","Our Northern California and Seattle regions posted the strongest sequential revenue gains at 2.6% each, while the mid-Atlantic and Southern California regions posted the lowest growth rates at 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. As I mentioned, economic occupancy declined 30 basis points sequentially to 95.8% as we adjusted our pricing parameters to push rents during the quarter.","Moving to regional performance. Revenue growth was solid in all regions, with the strongest year-over-year growth coming from Northern California and Seattle at 10.2% and 8.8%, respectively. In Northern California, strength on the tech sector continues to drive robust job growth and apartment demand. And from a supply perspective, the delivery of new apartments in Northern California is still relatively insignificant. As Tim mentioned, we expect more supply to come online in San Jose, particularly Northeast San Jose, as we move into 2013. However, we don't expect to see much of an impact from new supply throughout the remainder of 2012.","The Seattle economy also continues to perform well, benefiting from growth in not only the tech sector, which is being supported by Microsoft, Facebook, Google and other small tech businesses, but also from retail trade, which is being driven in part by Amazon's expansion in the market, along with aircraft manufacturing at Boeing. New supply will come online next year in Seattle, but it is highly concentrated in the downtown or near-downtown submarkets where we have very little presence.","As for the rest of the country, the Southern California, New York and New England regions posted revenue gains of 4.5% to 5.5%, while the mid-Atlantic region grew by 3.6%. In Southern California, the economic recovery continues to lag with job growth of only 0.4% for the 6 months ended June 30. The soft demand has been partially offset by very, very low levels of supply. In fact, new supply in the Southern California region is projected to be the lowest of any region in our portfolio at approximately 0.5% of stock through 2014.","In the New York region, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Manhattan accessible areas of Northern New Jersey continue to perform well, supported in part by high-tech employers opening offices in the region. Meanwhile, our communities in the outer portions of the New York Metro area, including Westchester and Fairfield, have lagged due to weakness in the financial services sector. In Boston, job growth is being fueled by the high tech, medical and education sectors and has reaccelerated to a pace north of 1% for the 6 months ended June 30.","Shifting now to operating expenses. 3% year-over-year increase in operating expenses was driven by payroll and benefits costs, marketing and insurance, which are partly offset by savings in bad debt and utilities costs. As we have mentioned in the past, operating expenses can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter based on a number of different factors. So judging operating expense growth on a year-to-date basis tends to give you a better picture of where we are headed. On a year-to-date basis through June 30, operating expenses for the same-store portfolio increased 0.8%, with increases in insurance, property taxes, payroll and benefits and maintenance being offset by reductions in 3 main areas: first, bad debt, which is a result of not only an improving economy but in new collection strategy we implemented at our customer care center in Virginia Beach; second, utilities, including the benefit of the mild winter but also investments we've made in the area of energy efficiency and sustainability last year; and thirdly, in the area of marketing, some of which is timing related and will be incurred in the second half of the year.","As we look forward into the second half, the portfolio is well positioned as we move -- as we look ahead. Economic occupancy for July is trending at 96%, about 20 basis points north of our second quarter average, and availability is currently 5%, down 75 basis points from our average availability in Q2 and 50 basis points below where we were at the same time last year.","In terms of July activity for renewals and new move-ins, committed renewals are in the high 5s, while new move-ins are in the low 5s, consistent with second quarter trends. August and September renewal offers went out in the high-5% to mid-6% range.","Based on year-to-date results in current portfolio trends, our revised outlook for 2012 reflects same-store revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%, with the midpoint of 5.75% being consistent with our original guidance. The Northern California and Seattle regions are projected to continue to outperform, while the mid-Atlantic markets are projected to lag behind the rest of the portfolio.","In terms of operating expenses, we expect full year operating expenses in the same-store portfolio to increase between 1.5% and 2.5%, about 100 basis points below our original guidance. We now expect full year NOI growth in the same-store portfolio will fall between 7% and 8%.","Now I'd like to shift topics and make a few comments about our transaction activity and the transaction market. First, in terms of dispositions, we sold 2 wholly-owned communities during the quarter, one in Oakland and the other in Chicago. These properties were sold for a combined sales price of $174 million at a blended 5.3% cap rate, generating an unlevered IRR of 11% over a 15-year holding period and an aggregate economic gain of about $66 million.","In addition, we also sold one Fund I community in Chicago for $34.5 million. With the disposition activity in the second quarter, we completed our exit of the Chicago market.","On the acquisition front, we acquired one property during the quarter, Eaves Cerritos, which is a community of 151 homes located in the Cerritos submarket of Los Angeles. The community was acquired for $29.5 million.","In addition, we executed a binding agreement to acquire our joint venture partner's 70% interest in Avalon Del Rey, a community of 309 homes we developed in 2006, for a purchase price of approximately $67 million. As a result of this transaction, we will gain control of 100% of an attractive asset and unlock our promoted equity interest, which previously received no cash flow. We expect to close the transaction at the end of this month, which will bring year-to-date acquisition volume for AvalonBay to roughly $120 million.","In terms of the transaction market, while overall trading activity in the U.S. is up about 10% compared to last year, activity in our markets is actually down about 15%. The reduction in the supply of available assets combined with healthy apartment fundamentals and plentiful capital has continued to put upward pressure on pricing. And in some markets, particularly on the West Coast, inventories are low enough that we're starting to see a bit of a scarcity premium on assets that do trade. Cap rates on the West Coast currently range between 4% and 5%, with urban and the high-quality suburban assets trading at the low end of that range. Cap rates on the East Coast range from 4.75% to 5.75% with the exception of assets in the attractive boroughs of New York City, which can trade anywhere between the high 3s and the high 4s, depending on how you value any tax abatement. Buyers are indicating that their unlevered IRR targets are in the 6% to 7% range for core assets and 7% to 8% for core-plus to value-add opportunities.","As you may recall, our initial outlook contemplated $350 million to $450 million of dispositions and $450 million to $550 million in acquisitions for AvalonBay. In addition, we expected Fund I dispositions of $150 million to $250 million. Although the transaction market tends to be seasonal as activity weighted towards the back half of the year, we have also been highly selective about acquisitions in light of current pricing levels and reduced volume. As a result, given year-to-date activity and our view about current pricing levels, our revised outlook for the year now reflects a net neutral trading position, with wholly-owned dispositions and acquisitions each falling into a range of $250 million to $350 million for the year.","In terms of fund activity, we have accelerated some Fund I dispositions given attractive pricing levels, and now expect Fund I dispositions to range between $250 million to $350 million for the year, an increase of $100 million from our initial outlook.","In addition, we have targeted the opportunistic disposition of select Fund II assets and expect to dispose of 1 to 2 properties with an aggregate value of between $40 million and $100 million.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for an update on the balance sheet and our capital markets activity. Tom?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Thanks, Sean. This afternoon, I'd like to cover a few topics. First would be our capital-raising activity under our second continuous equity program. I'd also like to talk about how this activity prepares the balance sheet and other key credit metrics to help support the investment activity that Sean and Tim has noted. And then, finally, I'd like to talk about our sources and use of capital for the year and our updated financial outlook.","With respect to capital raising, we raised approximately 200 million under our continuous equity program through July. These shares were issued in June and early July at an average share price of about $140 a share, and complete the $500 million program that we launched in 2010. Issuing equity under this format is an important part of our integrated capital management program or ICM. This program allows us to cost effectively match fund permanent capital concurrently with or in advance of committing to new investment activity. And this alignment ensures adequate liquidities in place to complete the new development underway and also mitigates capital market and funding risks.","Separate from these equity issuances, the company repaid a $15 million mortgage in accordance with its scheduled maturity. And combined with the secured and the unsecured debt maturities of $228 million in the first quarter, we have now retired $242 million of debt year-to-date. The equity raised and the debt reduction served to delever the balance sheet and support accretive new investment that will drive future NAV and FFO per share growth. This capital activity also serves to reduce our exposure to what appears to be asymmetrical downside risk present in the global economy and capital and credit markets.","Looking at our liquidity and key credit metrics, we continue to enjoy great liquidity and access to capital. At the end of the second quarter, we had no borrowings out under our $750 million credit facility, and we had $430 million of cash on hand. With about $940 million remaining to fund for the development and redevelopment underway and short-term debt maturities of just $200 million, we have sufficient liquidity on hand or contractually available to fund near-term investment and financing commitments.","So overall, our changes in our sources and uses of capital for the year are quite modest. Our initial outlook contemplated sourcing $800 million in new permanent capital. That new capital and cash on hand was targeted to fund $800 million in development, net acquisitions of $100 million and $450 million in debt repayments. Thus far, in 2012, we've sourced $200 million in equity capital and retired $242 million in secured and unsecured debt. Total development funding remains on track, and we now contemplate being largely net neutral on acquisitions and dispositions, which reduces this funding need by approximately $100 million.","Our current plan is consistent with our original capital sourcing plan, and although the timing of the capital raised may change based on capital market conditions and our decision to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund 2013 development activity.","A lot of numbers quoted here, but they underscore the flexibility we enjoy in both the type and the timing of our capital-raising activity and are supported by our key credit metrics. And just to point out a few of these, as of June 30, debt-to-total-market capital is about 20%. Net debt-to-EBITDA was about 4.7x. And our unencumbered NOI had increased to 73%. Interest coverage for the quarter was about 4.8x.","Before I turn the call back over to Tim, I'd like to make a couple of comments about our revised outlook for 2012, and in coming up with our midyear re-forecast, we took into account a number of key variables,, including updated employment growth projections, expected operating performance and projected investment capital sourcing activity over the balance of the year. We now expect third quarter FFO per share of between $1.38 and $1.42 and we expect full year FFO per share to be about -- or between 5.39% and 5.53% -- $5.53 per share. The midpoint of our FFO guidance would represent a year-over-year growth rate of about 19.5% and the second consecutive year of strong double-digit FFO per share growth. Importantly, the strong growth is not being driven by financial leverage, as we continue to reduce our leverage through the cycle. Instead, our earnings growth is driven by durable and attractive operating environment and by a focus on enhancing value for shareholders through a development platform that is match-funded with permanent capital. And as Sean noted, same-store NOI growth is projected to be in the 7% to 8% range for the year and we're on track to start over $1 billion in highly accretive new development.","So to recap this outlook, we've increased our FFO estimates by $0.06 per share, primarily driven by operating expense savings, a shift in the timing of financing activity and partly offset by reduced acquisitions.","With those comments, I will turn the call back over to Tim.","Timothy J. Naughton","Thanks, Tom. I'd like to take a couple of more minutes just to provide an update on our development activity and close with some thoughts on how we view the economics and value creation from our development platform during this cycle.","Turning first to recent development activity. Altogether, we currently have 20 communities under construction, located across 6 regions, with a projected capital cost of over $1.6 billion. This reflects the completion of 4 communities with a projected cost of $250 million and the commencement of construction of 4 communities with a projected cost of $310 million in Q2. The average projected yield for communities under construction today stands at around 7%.","Year-to-date, we have started 5 communities totaling $430 million and we anticipate starting another 9 communities totaling $700 million by year end, bringing total starts for the year to roughly $1.1 billion. And by year end, we expect to have approximately $2 billion under construction.","Meanwhile, we continue to expand the company's development pipeline with another 3 projects totaling $275 million added in Q2 and almost $600 million in development rights added year-to-date. We now have 33 communities in our shadow development rights pipeline, representing $2.8 billion in future development opportunities in addition to the $1.6 billion under construction.","As for our lease-ups, performance continues to be strong. We currently have 10 communities in lease-up, and for these communities, the average lease rent is about $80 higher than pro forma, resulting in projected stabilized yields of approximately 40 to 50 basis points greater than pro forma.","There's something [ph] I'd like to share some thoughts on our development platform and how it contributes to our ability to grow net asset value over the long term. Since the company first went public in the early '90s, we believe that a carefully managed and properly funded development platform will provide a distinctly attractive way to enhance net asset value for our shareholders over the full business cycle. This is because development offers the opportunity to invest in new communities at stabilized yields that are historically, on average, 150 to 200 basis points higher than the prevailing cap rate at which existing communities can be acquired. As many of our long-term investors know, the value created by our development platform is often obscured by traditional earnings metrics such as FFO multiples. This is even more pronounced at a time when we are ramping up volume and development economics are particularly attractive, as is the case today. In fact, currently, we have almost $1.5 billion invested in mostly non-income-producing assets in the form of construction in progress, land held for development, pursued [ph] cost and recent completions that are not yet stabilized. In addition, when this investment is ultimately converted into stabilized income-producing assets with yields in the 7% range, valuations that rely on simplistic FFO metrics during this part of the cycle distort estimates and do not properly reflect the true intrinsic value of the company.","However, longer-term analysis of our track record reveals more clearly the benefits of our development focus. In addition to decisions about market selection, capital allocation, as well as our management efforts, we believe that our focus on development is an important reason why we've been able to deliver outside annualized growth and NAV per share over the last 10 years of 11% as compared with 7% for our peers. It's also the reason why over the same period we've been able to generate outperformance in shareholder returns, annualized of 16% versus a peer average of 12% and grow our dividend by a total of 40% while the peer average has declined by 16% over the same period.","Today, the profit spread on new development is at or near an all-time high, both in absolute and relative terms. Currently, the spread is 200-plus basis points or about 50% higher than the cap rates at which similar quality product can be bought in our markets. By capturing the spread on the approximate $4 billion and construction starts since 2010 and planned through 2013, we anticipate creating around $20 in incremental NAV per share across the earlier part of the business cycle through our development platform, enhancing the attractive returns we'd otherwise expect to provide to our shareholders by investing in some of the best apartment markets in the country.","So in summary, our portfolio continues to deliver strong NOI growth across every region. Our lease-up communities continue to outperform expectation. With strong operating development platforms and a balance sheet position to fund our growth, we remain well positioned to deliver outside earnings and NAV growth over the next several years.","And with that, operator, we'd like to open up the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","You talked about upping the sales pace of Fund I to $250 million, $350 million this year. When you get done with that, what does that leave you in terms of dollar value of assets and number of assets in Fund I?","Sean J. Breslin","Rob, this is Sean. In terms of Fund I activity, we did up the range, and I believe we have about 17 assets left in that fund. We plan to exit to be somewhere, depending on what gets executed or doesn't get executed, somewhere in the range of 3 to 4 assets. So it'd bring it down to somewhere in the neighborhood of 13, 14 assets, somewhere in that vicinity, which would represent, have to look at the numbers, I think it's probably around, it's about $400 million or so left to go, which would be spread over the rest of '13 and '14.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And I mean from a timing standpoint, is there any reason why you wouldn't sell more sooner rather than later from your standpoint as long as the market conditions allow?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure, Rob. Good question. A couple of comments on that. First is the majority of those assets have secured debt against them, so we do factor in the prepayment multi-costs so we're looking at when the debt matures, what the cost is as one part of the decision-making process. But we also have some assets in markets where NOI growth is still pretty robust. And so we'll take a look at sensitivities about what we think that NOI growth might look like relative to the change in cap rate that could occur and sort of determine the optimal time to sell those assets. So sort of blending both of those things. The prepayment penalties, as well as the asset specific NOI growth and potential valuation changes.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, Tim, given all your comments on the development pipeline, what are you guys seeing today in terms of any inflationary pressure on the hard cost for future developments as you try to underwrite your back half '12 and '13 starts?","Timothy J. Naughton","Rob, we have seen a little bit of pressure on the cost in the construction side, and I think we talked a little bit about this last quarter. I think what we're seeing today is still consistent with that, where costs have maybe come back about 1\/3 from how much they had declined from the prior peak. So costs depending upon the market and product type of costs were down 15% to 25% from the peak. Today, they're down maybe 10% to 15%.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","And are you seeing pressure in any particular place, whether or not it's steel, oil products, et cetera?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, we had been seeing pressure in some commodity costs. We've seen some relief in certain costs lately, but I don't know that it's pronounced and concentrated in any one area at this point.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then land cost, and just along the same lines, I mean what are you guys -- you guys continue to tie up sites. I mean, is it for anything that's going to be ready to be constructed on, in the next couple of years? I mean, how aggressive is pricing for land today?","Timothy J. Naughton","For the most part, the answer is no, we haven't been tying up sites lately that are going to be ready, say, over the next year that are entitled. I'd say the majority of them require some kind of entitlement or re-entitlement. As we've mentioned on our last couple of calls, sites that are ready to go tend to be bid up in auction oftentimes to merchant builders who are looking to accelerate fee income streams, if you will. And so we really have shifted our focus in increasing -- in our increasing and shifting our focus towards sites that are likely to be optioned, take 2 to 3 years to get through the process where the competitive dynamics aren't quite as intense.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Last year, I believe, Avalon started to see rents start to slow maybe in August, and I was wondering if you're seeing anything in the data you track that would suggest that, that occurred in June or July this year?","Sean J. Breslin","Jana, this is Sean. What you stated is true. Typically, we start to ramp up rents in the first quarter and push them through the summer months and just depending on what year we're in, things will move around a little bit. But we're not seeing much of a different trend this year in terms of sort of the sweet spot of the year, if you want to consider that the right phrase. I think what we're seeing this year is consistent what we've seen in years past in terms of the window throughout the year that we can push around.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","At And I think you gave us a low 5% on new leases in July. Do you have that number for April, May, June?","Sean J. Breslin","The numbers for July which were renewals in the high 5s and move-ins in the low 5s are relatively consistent with what we saw moving through the second quarter.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then maybe just on, if you look at -- evaluate potential acquisitions, is it -- and also just assets or land, are you looking in all markets or only ones where you currently have a presence?","Timothy J. Naughton","In terms of both acquisitions and land, we're only looking for assets and opportunities in our existing markets. We're not looking to extend our footprint at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just quickly. Are you seeing any change in yields in the development in progress at this point? And if so, what are the mechanics of those changes?","Timothy J. Naughton","David, Tim here. When you ask about changes in yields in development in progress, are you talking about the ones that are actually in lease-up, is that your question?","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Yes. I guess the lease-up and then any expectations you might have for the starts in the second half of this year and into next year. I know you sort of mentioned an aggregate, but I assume that number is moving somewhat.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, just to refresh everyone's memory, when we state development yields, they generally don't change from the time which we start construction until the time we start leasing, which oftentimes is 9 months to over 1 year. And generally, what we have been seeing over the last year, 1.5 years, is that rents have been moving consistent with overall market rents during that period of time. So I was quoting that rents were up $80 on those deals that we started to lease up. That's about 4% -- 4% or 5% up from the time that we actually started construction for that basket of assets. So generally, we would expect communities that are going to be starting to lease up here over the next couple of quarters to reflect rents that are up a bit from how we underwrote them at the time we actually started construction.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. So there's still somewhat of a net-up trend is sort of what I'm hearing?","Timothy J. Naughton","Certainly, there is for the 10 communities that are at lease up. We would expect the same would be true just based upon the transfer contingency in the marketplace, as Sean outlined, in terms of new movements and renewals that we're seeing.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I just have one other question. Relative to the occupancy loss that you mentioned, and I know you sort of attributed that to the rent growth or the sort of aggressive rent pushing in the quarter. What can we sort of expect for the next couple of quarters as we go into slightly weaker seasons? And it would appear that you're sort of hitting the limit in terms of how hard you can push without really materially losing occupancy. Can we expect to see some sort of dial back on those new and renewal growth rates or sort of a flattening from current levels? Or even some downside?","Sean J. Breslin","David, this is Sean. As I mentioned, the August and September numbers are going out in the high 5% to mid-6% range. And as we go throughout the year, when we go through and handle revenue management, it is, if you think of the process sort of weekly, the pushing and pulling based on different markets in terms of where we can push rents, where we need to pull back to gain some occupancy and that continues to happen throughout the entire year, frankly. But as I mentioned earlier, we tend to push seasonally where you can see it from the first quarter through the early part of the third quarter, to get through August and September. And then new move-in changes tend to back off a little bit. So that seasonal pattern would be the same this year would be our expectation. But based on the renewals that are going out and the fact that, as of right now, we're basically sitting at economic occupancy of, call it, 96%, which is above the second quarter average and availability is down to 5%, which is the lowest point of the year, we would be pushing hard as we look forward here on new move-ins to see where that limit is and then dial back. So it's hard to give you a specific conclusion at this point other than the portfolio is well positioned today to push hard through the next quarter, and we'll see how things respond.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derek Bower with UBS.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could just talk about any markets where you're seeing Bs starting to outperform maybe some of your A class?","Sean J. Breslin","Derek, this is Sean. Typically, what we see over the cycles, and this is going back quite a ways, is that as you get into particularly the earlier part of the upcycle, As tend to outperform Bs. And then when you get to a point where supply starts to materialize, it tends to soften the growth rate on As to a certain degree. But if you look at sort of currently where we are over the last 4 quarters, for our portfolio specifically, As have outperformed Bs to the extent of about 230 basis points on the east and about 180 basis points on the west. Now one thing to keep in mind there is that our sample size in terms of the B portfolio is relatively small. So we do look at third-party benchmarks whether it be REITs or Axiometrics to see what's happening in the market in general. And the trend seems to be consistent when you look at the third-party providers in terms of their results versus ours, where in most markets As are outperforming Bs. But you have to sort of dig under the covers a little bit to figure out whether it's just a class difference that's really driving the performance or whether it tends to be specific submarket locations as well. So it's sort of a blanket statement that last 4 quarters As are outperforming Bs. But regional differences also drive that as well.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And there's no real pockets where you're seeing Bs really outperform As at this point?","Sean J. Breslin","Not necessarily in our portfolio, but again it's a pretty small sample size. I mean, we look at the third-party data, some of the exceptions are Bs seem to be doing better in L.A., San Diego and Long Island. But the differences aren't necessarily that material.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just lastly, can you discuss the -- I don't know if I missed this, the move-out for financial reasons and maybe state what those were in the Northeast and Northern California?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure. In terms of, you're talking about rent increases specifically, for the whole portfolio, second quarter was about 18%, which is actually down about 100 basis points compared to last year. It is up above long-term averages, which are closer to about 10%. And in terms of pressure from a regional point of view, there's not material changes year-over-year. Southern Cal is up a little bit, a couple of points. New York, New Jersey, the mid-Atlantic were down 4% or 5%. In terms of your specific question about Northern California, it's running close to 27%, 28% and is well above its long-term averages. But we continue to have plenty of traffic coming through to support higher rent growth. And one of the things that we are seeing is just the profile of our residents and the incomes that they're generating. If you look at some of the high-growth markets now in Northern California and Seattle, take Seattle is an example, if you look at new lease income on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, households moving into our apartments, their incomes were up 14% on a year-over-year basis in Seattle, which is pretty strong, and we're seeing strong growth in Northern California as well. So even though we are seeing people make decisions to move out due to financial reasons, a market like Northern California, that tends to happen where you have people that have moved closer in to San Jose or, say, San Francisco that start to get priced out, and they do move out to some of the East Bay markets where they can take BART or some of the South San Jose markets as well, which provides them with easier access now that the 87 Freeway is open. So we do see a sort of a laddering effect or a domino effect in terms of people moving out. But the core of the group coming in is coming in with pretty high incomes, and it's being supported by the level of traffic that we need to hold the occupancy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citigroup.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Tim, you talked about how development spreads are today, about the highest they've ever been, I think you said near all-time highs, and about the large value creation around development. I'm just curious how long you think this opportunity can last before either land and construction prices get bid up or enough supply delivers to keep rental rates down. I'm just curious if you look at the next couple of years, how long do you think you can keep getting these types of spreads?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, Eric, it's always a function of just the competitive dynamics as well as what's happening more broadly in the economy and what's going on with land and construction costs, so it's an interplay of a number of different factors. I can't say the deals that we're putting under contract today and they're getting through due diligence, they are exhibiting similar economics to those deals that are actually under construction, both in terms of average cost per unit or projected cost per unit and yields. Generally kind of in the 6 and -- call it, 6.75% range, maybe low 6% range on the West Coast and 7% range on the East Coast, roughly averaging around high 6%. So it depends a bit on the cycle. In the '90s, we were able to develop accretively from the time we went public in late '93 all the way through to 2001. So we had about a 7-, 8-year run there. I would tell you in this last cycle, it more or less mirrored the economic cycle where it was maybe 4 years where we had a nice run from about '04 to '07.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And then, Tom, you alluded to this in your remarks, but when I think back to your equity raise last August, the main reason for it was to prefund your development pipeline. So I was a little surprised that you finished your ATN this quarter. So I'm just curious, one, are you going to start another ATN? And two, do you think we're still in the type of environment where you need to prefund development activity?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Eric, in terms of the -- let me take the last question first. In terms of the environment, I wouldn't say that the capital markets have settled enough where we feel like we don't need to keep cash on the balance sheet. One of the reasons that we keep cash on the balance sheet is somewhat of a shock absorber. In the past, you remember we'd run up the line and we'd pay it off with this great offering. And basically, delivering capital just in time of its need, and we don't feel like we're back in a stable capital market environment where we can deliver capital just in time. So overall, I think you can continue to expect that we're going to keep some cash on the balance sheet and a lot of flexibility. In terms of the just completed CEP, we can't speak to another program at this time. What we can say is that we like the CEP format. We believe it's a good fit for our business. It fits it especially well, giving us an ability to continuously match equity capital with a steady flow of new development spending. So for all the businesses that have a need for something like a CEP, I think ours is uniquely matched to it. So that's probably all the comments I should make about our equity program.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Samuel O'Neill (sic) [Sandler O'Neill]","Andrew Schaffer","It's actually Andrew Schaffer here. First, I'd like to go back to the development yields. And I was wondering if your internal required returns have increased on these new developments over the last 3 months given the macro uncertainties?","Timothy J. Naughton","This is Tim. No, not really. I mean, when we do look at -- we look at a couple of different return metrics. We do look at initially yield, and that's generally what we talk to the investment and analyst community about. But we also look at IRRs. So we have targets for both, and they tend to be -- they are tied very much to our cost of capital and where we view we're at right now both from a real estate cycle and the capital market cycle. Given that -- given Tom's remarks that we've largely been matched funding, we don't always see a need to increase our target yields as long as we're not mismatching the funding by 1 year or 2 years from the time we're actually making the commitment.","Andrew Schaffer","Okay. And then secondly, I want to talk about the kind of mix in Washington, D.C., and I was wondering if you've seen any reduction in the percentage of your tenants that work for the government?","Sean J. Breslin","Andrew, this is Sean. Not anything material that showed up in our resident profile reports that we look at that would be worth talking about in detail. Not at this point, no.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just talk about the same-store revenue forecast of 5.5%, and looking back at your history and at other peak periods of good fundamental activity, you're doing almost or more than 100 basis points better than that. These are like arguably the best times ever in the multifamily space. Why do you think that you're not achieving the same level of internal growth that you were in past cycles?","Timothy J. Naughton","Rich, Tim here. I think there's probably a couple of reasons. One, I think this last downcycle wasn't as deep as the prior downcycle, that's for one. So typically the peaks are somewhat of a function of the prior trough.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You did 6 3 in '07 and 6 6 in '06, so you arguably had some tough comps and yet you still did much better, I guess?","Timothy J. Naughton","I'm sorry, I missed the point.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The point is, if you're saying that your comps were easier or harder this time around, it wouldn't have been the case in 2007. You had a pretty tough comp and you did better in terms of internal growth than you're projected to do now.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, but the trough was actually deeper in early 2000s and then as you came back to the peak in 2006, it usually has a bigger bounce since there'd been a -- it was a shallower trough this last time. That's one thing, and I would say inflation is just lower too and rents aren't any different than any other kind of consumer product or durable good where they're oftentimes seem somewhat tethered to levels of inflation. So 5.75 is arguably 400 basis points or so above where inflation levels have been. And I think that spread is actually pretty compelling relative to even past trends that we've seen.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. That's fair. And then my second question is, at the beginning, Tim, you said as the cycle matures in reference to your development and how you're going to add value, but is there any connection between the maturing cycle and you as a company moving to a net neutral in terms of acquisitions and dispositions whereas you previously were projected to be a net acquirer, and hence maybe more of aggressive mindset. Is there any connection between those 2 or is it -- are the 2 mutually exclusive?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, I mean, clearly for us, development is a better use of capital today than acquisitions. And as cap rates have continued to get bid down and yet our development yields are going up arguably, development's a better use of capital. But for us,, whether we're net acquirer or a net seller, it's also somewhat a function of other sources of capital and how disposition is priced relative to other sources of capital, with debt and equity being as attractive as they are right now relative to where we were back when we were putting together our plan. For us, it's just argues to be more neutral than a net acquirer today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to know the 4 new pads that were bought in second quarter, where those developments are going to be happening and what you expect to be total cost on yield on those developments?","Timothy J. Naughton","Are you talking about the new development rights, I'm sorry?","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The new development [indiscernible] the 4 that were done in 2Q.","Sean J. Breslin","You're talking about the land acquisitions that we referenced?","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Correct, the land acquisitions, sorry.","Timothy J. Naughton","I don't have the actual land acquisitions right in front me to tell you exactly where they're at. I have the development rights that we secured in Q2, which we had 3 development rights. And those were in New Jersey and Southern California, but I don't have the land parcel in front of me.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Martin with MorningStar.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","With respect to the development pipeline, based on the estimated return assumptions, can you provide some bit of insight as to the rent-to-income dynamics or metrics and the single-family home affordability metrics associated with that pipeline? I'm assuming it's similar to your aggregate portfolio, but I just want to check that out.","Timothy J. Naughton","This is Tim. Generally, on the development and the Class A and the more expensive or higher rent communities, generally, the rent-to-income is actually lower than the portfolio average. So the portfolio average is, call it, 20%. We're just underneath that today. It maybe 17% or 18% for the development portfolio. And for the more moderate income communities, it may be closer to, call it, 22%, 23%. So that relationship tends to hold up through the -- over time across markets and through the cycle.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then secondly, is AvalonBay experiencing, in anyway, a change in trend in aggregate or by market in a request for breaking the lease? Are you seeing any trends and an increase or decrease in renters wanting to break a lease for whatever reason?","Sean J. Breslin","Philip, this is Sean. The answer is no. There's no material change, and we have sort of a category that reflects people using lease breaks, skips, evictions, et cetera and it's been pretty flat. They're running about 5%. It's actually down 1% year-over-year. Certainly, down from the peak that we had during the great recession where we saw more of that, people breaking leases and either skipping or having to be evicted due to financial reasons. So we're pretty stable over the past year, though.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just 2 questions. First a follow-up on Derek's question about move-outs. Are you seeing any change in move-outs for home purchase?","Sean J. Breslin","Paula, this is Sean. In aggregate, the answer is no. Second quarter is about 14%, 14.5%, I think as Tim mentioned in his prepared remarks. It's up about a point year-over-year, but not terribly material. Regional, we are seeing some differences by region, of course. I think also as Tim mentioned, Boston has trended up a bit. It's up about 5% on a year-over-year basis as is Seattle and San Jose, which is somewhat to be expected in the incomes that are generating -- or excuse me, in the markets that are generating better income growth and capital gains being invested in homes versus some other markets it's trending down. So net-net, for the overall portfolio, it's about the same but there are differences up and down from region to region.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And also on the Rockville and Andover developments that delivered a quarter early, what drove that accelerated delivery? And are there any other projects that are trending ahead of plan?","Timothy J. Naughton","Paula, Tim here. It's not unusual that we finish 1 month or 2 early from our original schedules. As we just get into the production part of the construction schedule we're really -- all the site work is done, all the amenities are done and you're just really -- you're really just finishing buildings. Oftentimes, you pick up some time as the subs just get familiar with the product and cycle times just come down. So it's not unusual. But it's usually 1 month or 2. It's usually not 4 or 5 months just to put it in perspective.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bill Hutch [ph] with Citi Global Markets.","Unknown Analyst","Just going to the development pipeline for a second. You talked about the different regions and then you mentioned development yields on the East Coast, I think around a 7% and on the West a 6%. How are the development yields by region? And do you weight towards more the East Coast because of those higher development yields or how do you look at sort of planning development for future?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, it's a fair question. Really, each region, each market, each deal really has a unique target yield in terms of how we look at development. Typically, the West Coast has been characterized by higher growth markets and so you generally get more of your return through growth as opposed to the initial coupon, if you will. So oftentimes, whether it's a cap rate on an acquisition or a yield on a new development, 50 to 100 basis points is not unusual at all where those with pro forma out to. And would also be consistent with our targets. So if a typical development yield just had a target IRR of, call it, 10% on the East Coast, it may come through 7% on the initial coupon, then 2.5%, 3% on growth. And on the West Coast, it may come -- come through 6% on the initial coupon, then 3.5%, 4% on cash flow growth over time. So it's really that, that drives it more than anything. And I think you asked about the specific yields across regions. In New England, they'd be in the 7%-plus range; New York would probably be more like West Coast, 6%, 6.25%, typically in terms of urban. New Jersey would be more similar to New England, 7% plus; mid-Atlantic is probably mid- to high-6s. And then on the West Coast, California markets would be in the 6% range; Seattle, more like mid-Atlantic, call it 6.5%, 6.75%.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then lastly, I think you mentioned $20 increase in NAV for the company in the development pipeline. How much of the development pipeline does that encompass, is it the 1.6?","Timothy J. Naughton","No. I was referencing the $4 billion that were already started since the beginning of the cycle, call it 2010, and we're anticipating starting before by the end of 2013. So of that $4 billion, if you've got 50% sort of profit embedded in that or projected to have be embedded in that, that's where you get the $2 billion -- you get about $2 billion, roughly on a 100 million shares gets you to the $20 per share.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg with Zelman & Associates.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Can you talk first about the spread that you are seeing and have seen between the renewal increases that you send out and what you achieved. For example, I think on the first quarter call, you said that you were sending out renewal notices above a 7 for July and then you just said that you achieved in the high 5s. So could you just put that in historical context for this cycle and your expectations going forward.","Sean J. Breslin","Dave, this is Sean. In terms of spreads, overall, to put it in the context, historically, those numbers run anywhere from 60 to 70 basis points. But it does depend on where we are in the cycle. So if we're pushing harder sometimes in the market, they'll get a little bit wider and vice versa. So it's hard to pinpoint it precisely. But I think if you use somewhere in the neighborhood of 75 to 100 basis points on average, that wouldn't be off terribly.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","So you're saying that you'd expect it to narrow again from what you saw in July? So I think you said that you're sending out notices for August, September in the high 5s to low 6s. So you'd expect it to be within 75 basis points of that?","Sean J. Breslin","For August and September, it's high 5s to mid-6s is where they're going out. And based on availability where we are now, et cetera, I think, we'll certainly come off of that. But it's yet to be seen as where we'll end up. So I can't really give you a precise range. I can just sort of give you what we've experienced in the past.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And the other question is just on the acquisition market. You mentioned that you're having a tough time finding acquisitions, and at the same time, we'd note that you seem more concerned about the outlook for the D.C. market than some of your peers. So could you just talk about your experience as it relates to transactions in that market. How far off are you on deals in D.C. that you're bidding on? Or are you even bidding on deals in D.C. right now?","Sean J. Breslin","In D.C. Metro, overall, we are looking at opportunities. I wouldn't say that we're really bidding on them though. When we lay out our plan for the year, we take a look at where we are in the sort of fundamental apartment cycle for each market, where pricing is and what our expectations are for NOI growth in the near term and the long term, of course, but particularly the near term, and try to decide whether we think it's an opportunistic window to acquire assets in one market versus another. And at this point, based on what we've seen in pricing trends, we have not been an active bidder in the D.C. region. So that will change probably at some point, but that's not one of our target markets at this point in time.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. And therefore, have you seen any evidence in that market yet about -- that suggests that cap rates are expanding?","Sean J. Breslin","Not necessarily, no. Like I said, we're not bidding heavily, but what we have seen seems to be relatively aggressive, particularly on the private side where borrowing costs are still very, very inexpensive by historical measures. So people seem to still feel pretty good about D.C. overall. And most of the supply that's coming into this market hasn't started delivering yet. They'll be delivering in the last half of this year, going into next year. And that's when you may start to see some adjustment, but yet to be told. It depends on how the demand side holds up and what NOI growth looks like.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just on the development, as you're looking at new development right additions, where are you seeing the better opportunities today? Is it more urban or is it more in the suburban side? And also is it becoming harder to get land entitled? Are you seeing any pushback there?","Timothy J. Naughton","Mike, Tim here. First on entitlement, no, not necessarily seeing that it'd be any more difficult than it normally is in our markets in part because there's really nothing else going on in terms of the other asset classes or other property sectors. It's still -- on the title side, it's still a long road in our markets and an expensive proposition, but we're not seeing the kind of antigrowth sentiment you might expect to see sort of at peak times in the cycle. In terms of the most attractive opportunity, I'd say it's more of a mix than it has been. Clearly, in the last decade, urban infill outperforms suburban in most of our markets, and I think that has attracted a fair bit of capital, and you are seeing some of the development opportunities start to stack up in those kind of locations. So in certain markets, it's caused us to pivot a bit in terms of looking more at the suburban opportunities. But if you cut across all of our markets, I'd say it's more of a mixed program between urban and suburban. And as we said many times before, we're agnostic in terms of how we create value in these markets. We believe in the structural advantages that our markets have. But at times, it makes sense to play in certain submarkets versus others. And so the same is true with respect to how the development opportunities we choose.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Second question. Is your 6 months into now rolling out to 2 new brands, are you seeing any difference either in traffic and the ability to push rents across, now that you have 3 brands? Are you seeing actually a little bit of a benefit as you convert some of the Avalon Communities to Eaves and AVA brands. Are you seeing any kind of benefit to the existing Avalon brand from it?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, Mike, Tim again here. I think it's going to be a while before we really can talk about the financial benefit of the branding strategy. I think what I can tell you is that in the assets that we have rebranded or brought to market in the case of the new brands, Eaves and AVA, it really appears that both the customers and prospects alike are reflecting the target customer that we have targeted for that brand and thought that's really the first test for people coming in the door and the people actually leasing. We actually type them relative to how they answer particular questions. But to the extent they hit that -- they fall in those target customer segments that the brand was intended for, that's the first sign you look for in terms of whether or not you're going to be able to deliver value through the brand framework, if you will. And so far so good on that with respect to both AVA and Eaves. We have a little bit more operating experience so far with the AVA brand than we do the Eaves, but both brands seem to be resonating with both prospects and customers at this point.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And the final question, just as you're active out there, both looking to buy as well as sell land on the development front, are you seeing any changes in underwriting in terms of growth rates as you're bidding up against people on developments and on properties?","Timothy J. Naughton","I think in terms of target returns, probably, probably matching some of the drift-down that you've seen on the acquisition side. I think Sean mentioned core deals, unlevered IRRs in the 6% to 7% range. That's probably, I don't know Sean, 75 to 100 basis points inside of what people were looking at a year ago. I think you're probably seeing some similar trends, particularly on the entitled side, Mike, for development opportunities. So if guys were chasing 11% unlevered IRRs, maybe today they're chasing 9.5% to 10% unlevered IRRs on development.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","My question on Southern California, Los Angeles and Orange County, I guess, we're sort of right at the bottom of all of your markets from a sequential perspective. And you mentioned, I think, in your remarks about job growth. Are you getting disappointed, concerned about the recovery there in Southern California? And I know it's been a target market for investment for you, you bought there this quarter, are you rethinking, trying to add additional exposure to Southern California as a result?","Sean J. Breslin","Karin, just in terms of recent performance, to make a few comments there, and then if Tim wants to chime in on the investment side, that's fine as well. But we have been, probably, as our peers have been, somewhat disappointed in the job growth numbers that have been coming out of Southern California in general. You mentioned L.A. and Orange County specifically, trailing 6 months job growth has been less than 50 basis points, like 24%. The forecast is for it to tick back up in the second half of '12 and end the year closer to about 1%. L.A. pretty broad, broadly diversified economy, driven heavily by the ports, which is really a retail trade activity. And so we need to see some acceleration in some of those demand drivers before we can get better apartment demand, of course. I mean, what has been helpful there is on the supply side, has been close to 0 for the most part. There is a couple little pockets where there is some supply but it's been at very, very low levels. And in terms of portfolio performance, that's helped offset some of the softness in demand. I mean, a good thing is turnover numbers are not terribly different in those markets from where they were. We are seeing a little bit of an uplift in home sales in Orange County as they burn through some of the inventory, and single-family inventories are pretty low levels now. So we're starting to get to a point we're starting to see some price movements. So for example, in Orange County, home sales are up about 20%. And in our areas of Orange County, the submarkets we're in specifically, there tends to be even less inventory than the county on average. So that's going to continue to put some pressure, I think, and start to see escalation in pricing in those submarkets. So we're starting to see signs that things are working in our direction, bad debt coming down, et cetera. But just we need more of a broader economic recovery for it to sort of kick in. So all the signs are there, the green shoots as people sometimes say. And hopefully, we can see it come around. I mean, we did get some good news out of San Diego in the second quarter with 2 carriers came in, which is about 6,000 people in San Diego, which is a pretty big number. One of those was originally from Washington State and will be permanently parked in San Diego now, which is helpful. So we're starting to see some signs. It's just the whole picture hasn't come quite together just yet.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call over to Tim Naughton for any closing remarks.","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, thank you, operator, and thanks for being on our second quarter call.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Jason Reilley, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley","Well, thank you, Alan, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially.

The attachment is available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton","Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our second quarter call. Joining me today are Sean Breslin, EVP of Investments and Asset Management; and Tom Sargeant, our Chief Financial Officer. Sean, Tom and I each have some prepared remarks, and then the 3 of us will be available for questions.","I'll begin by summarizing our results for the quarter, including our updated outlook, and then share some comments on the broader U.S. economy and apartment market fundamentals. Sean will then provide color on our second quarter operating performance, current trends in the portfolio and discuss our disposition activity. Finally, Tom will conclude our prepared remarks with an update on our development activity and capital plan for the balance of the year.","Starting with our results for the quarter, last night we reported EPS of $0.28 and FFO per share of $1.55, a 15.7% increase over the prior year. Adjusting for nonroutine items, which primarily include transaction and other costs related to the Archstone acquisition, FFO per share increased nearly 21%. This marked the eighth consecutive quarter of adjusted FFO growth of greater than 15%.","Overall, operating performance through the first half of 2013 was ahead of budget, driven by better-than-expected results from our operating and lease-up portfolios. Operating trends remained favorable as year-over-year same-store revenue growth in Q2 was higher than that experienced in Q1 and sequential same-store revenue growth was higher than in the second quarter of last year. The continued strength in portfolio performance supported by apartment fundamentals. Stronger job growth, favorable demographics and reduced housing inventory are all contributing to apartment market performance. We believe that we are still in the early portion of this apartment and housing cycle, and the underlying economy continues to improve in important areas that will support a sustainable expansion.","Based on our performance to date and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we have revised our outlook for 2013. We now expect full year same-store revenues to increase by 4.25% to 5%, or an increase of approximately 40 basis points at the midpoint, and same-store NOI to increase by 5% to 5.75%, or an increase of roughly 60 basis points at the midpoint. We expect adjusted FFO to be $6.20 to $6.40 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share above our initial outlook at the midpoint. About 2\/3 of this increase is attributable to better than projected portfolio performance, and most of the remainder, the results are projected savings and overhead and other operating costs. At the midpoint of $6.30 per share, adjusted FFO per share is projected to be up by over 14% for the full year.","Turning to the macro environment. We believe the U.S. economy is better positioned for growth today than it has been at any time since the downturn. So far this year, growth has been driven by the domestic private sector with consumer business and homebuilder sentiment reaching prerecession levels by midyear. This growing confidence, combined with significant improvements in consumer and corporate balance sheets, are translating into stronger consumption and investment as corporations are finally putting some of their $2.5 trillion cash to work. Companies have been investing in manpower as well as job growth of 200,000 per month is coming entirely from the private sector and running well ahead of consensus projections made at the beginning of the year. Of course, there remain some well-documented risks that are limiting the economy from reaching its full growth potential, principally in the public and export-oriented sectors given domestic fiscal pressures and underperforming foreign economies. As long as our fiscal challenges can be managed in a way that doesn't undermine the improved confidence of the consumer and business sector, the economy should be able to continue on its path to a sustainable economic expansion, albeit perhaps more modest than experienced in previous cycles.","Stronger consumer confidence is resulting in increased activity in important areas of the private-sector economy, particularly in the auto and housing industries. New automobile sales are running at more than 16 million units per year, the highest level since the downturn and up roughly 75% from the trough. Similarly, existing home sales volume is up around 50% from the trough and 15% year-over-year, with pricing up over 30% nationally from last year. While recovery in the for sale sector has accelerated over the last few quarters, apartment performance has remained healthy and well above long-term trend. As we and others have said over the last few quarters, a strengthening for sale market is more a sign of a healthy economy rather than an unhealthy apartment market. Historically, apartment performance has been heavily correlated with the economy, and a sustainable economic expansion is unlikely to occur without a recovery and expansion of the overall housing market. As a result, we view the recovery in the for sale housing market as mostly positive for our business, as it's largely a reflection of growing consumer confidence finally translating into important economic activity.","Focusing for a moment on the supply side of the housing market. Total housing production has lagged demand in the cycle such that most, if not all, the excess housing inventory created in the mid-2000s has been worked off. However, as we discussed at our Investor Day in late June, current U.S. housing production of less than 1 million units per year is 600,000 units short of annual projected structural demand through the balance of the decade. That means that the housing sector, in total, will need to increase its level of annual production by more than 60% to meet demand. And yet many companies have not invested sufficiently in their organizations, new entitlements or the infrastructure required to satisfy this level of demand. This is not uncommon in capital intensive businesses that are subject to boom-bust cycles. Periods of overinvestment are often followed by periods of underinvestment. The misallocation of capital that leads the downturn in the first place is often followed by dislocation of capital that constrains the addition of productive capacity and new supply that is needed once recovery is underway.","This is where the housing industry is today. On the cusp of a housing shortage, that has likely become more pronounced over the next 2 to 3 years. This is the reason why we are seeing double-digit housing price increases at the same time we're experiencing mid-single-digit rent increases in many of our markets, all with below trend economic growth. Well not all the markets or segments of the housing industry will benefit equally from a growing housing imbalance, most will benefit nevertheless. For example, the lack of single-family supply and recent run-up in prices is impacting affordability and limiting alternatives for renters. We've seen this in our own portfolio as move outs due to home purchase remain substantially below long-term averages in all but 1 market. Housing affordability is being further pressured by higher interest rates, as longer maturity mortgages are up roughly 100 basis points over the last few months. Changes in relative affordability, along with demographic trends and consumer preferences, will continue to impact demand dynamics and factor into performance for various segments of the housing market as the expansion plays out. Importantly though, we remain bullish on the prospects of the entire housing sector and believe that both for sale and rental housing will benefit from compelling underlying fundamentals.","Lastly, I did want to address the issue of apartment supply more specifically. While overall housing production is projected to be well below structural demand, apartment deliveries are in the rise and projected to increase over the next few quarters to 1.5% to 2% of apartment start or roughly 250,000 units in annual deliveries. This level of new apartment supply is a bit higher than the long-term average and represents a higher percentage of total new housing start than normal. However, we are not particularly concerned by this level of production for a number of reasons. First, there is still virtually no new condo construction activity adding to new multifamily supply. Second, the current level of apartment starts is generally in line with the past couple of expansions and basically matches the current level of job growth and household formation. Third, supply is projected to peak at or near these levels by mid-2014 as trailing 12-month apartment starts appear to be leveling off in this range based upon recent monthly start activity. And lastly, apartments should represent a greater share of marginal housing production because of the composition of underlying demand. Demographic growth continues to be healthy in the young adult age cohort, or those under age 35, who have a higher propensity to rent and are doing so at much higher rates than past cycles. This age cohort is responsible for almost half of all net job growth experienced over the last couple of years and, therefore, is driving a higher proportion of marginal housing demand. While some markets will feel the effects of increased supply like the D.C. Metro area, overall, we believe that the apartment market is positioned to absorb this level of production with rents growing above trend over the next few years. In fact, Witten Advisors is projecting NOIs to grow by 24% over the 2013 to '16 time period on a cumulative basis.","So to sum it up, all these factors give us confidence in the broader economy and support our belief that the apartment cycle still has plenty of opportunity for growth. We're only 13 quarters into the apartment growth cycle and, so far, rents have increased by just over 10% on a cumulative basis. By comparison, the 90 cycle lasted 40 quarters and the rents grew by more than 50% on a cumulative basis during that time.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Sean for his remarks. Sean?","Sean J. Breslin","Thanks, Tim. As Tim mentioned, I will comment on operating performance during the second quarter, current portfolio trends and our disposition activity.","Starting with same-store results, year-over-year total rental revenue increased 5.2% driven by a 4.3% increase in rate and a 90 basis point increase in occupancy. Year-to-date, total rental revenue is up 5%, it reflects a 4.5% increase in rate and a 50 basis point increase in occupancy. Sequentially, total rental revenue increased 1.8%, 30 basis points more than the second quarter last year.","Same-store expenses for the second quarter increased 2% and are up 2.7% year-to-date. Expense growth is being driven primarily by property taxes, including significant increases in rate and\/or assessments in the New England, Metro New York, New Jersey and Pacific Northwest regions, along with insurance. Collectively, all other operating expenses are down year-to-date. Same-store NOI growth was 6.6% for the second quarter and 6.1% year-to-date.","In terms of the Archstone portfolio, overall performance continues to track modestly ahead of our original expectations, as we indicated during the first quarter call. Revenue is slightly ahead of our original underwriting and expenses are generally in line.","In terms of regional performance, the Mid-Atlantic continues to underperform the remainder of the same-store portfolio, producing year-over-year rental revenue growth of just under 2% and sequential rental revenue growth of 1.1%.","In terms of submarket differences, our suburban Maryland assets are currently underperforming the Northern Virginia portfolio. And in Washington D.C., our same-store portfolio of 2 assets is too small to draw any definitive conclusions about submarket performance, particularly since 1 of the 2 assets is student-oriented. The recently acquired Archstone Communities is in D.C., however, are performing relatively well and producing rent change in the mid-2% range currently. It's no secret that D.C. Metro area is facing challenging headwinds in terms of new supply and weak demand. We remain optimistic about the region over the long term, and recent data indicates the pace of new apartment starts is beginning to decline.","Moving to the Metro New York, New Jersey region. Healthy demand in the city drove year-over-year rental revenue growth of 5.3%. Sequentially, rental revenue increased 210 basis points, a growth rate we have not experienced in the region in nearly 2 years. Demand continues to be supported by employment growth in the technology sector. Yahoo! and Facebook are expanding their presence in Manhattan, and Brooklyn's Tech Triangle is becoming a popular hub for retail, healthcare, design and technology companies.","In New England, year-over-year rental revenue increased 3.6%. Apartment demand in the Fairfield New Haven remains weak as many of the financial services positions that once supported the area have been slow to return.","The greater Boston area produced healthy rental revenue growth as rates increased 3.5% and occupancy increased 90 basis points. Demand in Boston is being driven by job gains in the hospitality, professional and business services, retail, healthcare and financial services sectors.","Shifting to the West Coast, Northern California and Seattle continue to produce robust results, posting 8.8% and 8.6% year-over-year rental revenue gains, respectively. Both regions generated sequential rental revenue growth north of 2%. Construction, tech and retail hiring in the greater Seattle area are supporting strong demand. And while supply is being delivered downtown and in adjacent submarkets, it has not had a material impact on our Eastside portfolio.","In Northern California, tech-related hiring remains healthy. And while supply continues to be delivered in the Northern California region, particularly in San Jose, absorption remains robust given underlying job growth. Southern California continues its steady recovery, posting a 4.6% year-over-year increase in rental revenue. Southern California's trade and tech-based economy is on solid footing right now. For the last 5 years, Southern California has produced stronger average wage growth than it has rent growth, which supports our belief that this region has plenty of room to run.","Lastly, our new lease-ups are performing well. Leasing velocity averaged 27 leases per month during the quarter, about 20% ahead of last year's pace, while rental rates are approximately 3.5% ahead of our initial expectations. Projected yields are about 50 basis points ahead of our original pro forma.","Shifting now to other portfolio metrics. New move in rent change averaged about 3.5% for the quarter and renewals were up 5%. More importantly, the trend throughout the quarter was quite positive as new move in rent change trended up 100 basis points to 4% from April to June, while renewals increased 50 basis points to 5.25%. The positive momentum has continued into July, with new move and rent change north of 4%, which is roughly 75 basis points above last year's pace, while committed renewals are averaging 6%, which is in line with last year.","Renewal offers for August and September went out in the low 7% range, about 100 basis points above last year's offers. We continue to be aggressive with renewals given current occupancy rates in the low 96% range and availability in the mid-fives.","Annualized turnover for the quarter was 56%, essentially flat from Q2 2012. Move outs due to home purchase was 15%, consistent with Q2 2012 and, as Tim mentioned, is running well below long-term averages in every region, except 1, which is New England. And what might be considered good news for the economic outlook, move outs due to job relocation increased 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis, while move outs for financial reasons declined 330 basis points. Household rent to income ratios remained relatively flat at approximately 20%, in line with historical averages for our portfolio.","Switching now to transaction activity. We sold 2 assets during the quarter. Avalon at Dublin Station, a wholly-owned community we developed in the East Bay of Northern California was sold for $105 million. This sale reflected a cap rate in the low 4s and resulted in a $20 million economic gain.","We also sold a Fund I community, Avalon at Civic Center located in Norwalk, California. The 25-plus -year-old asset was sold for $46 million at roughly a 5% cap rate. We remain an active seller and currently have $280 million of wholly-owned assets under contract and another $85 million in the marketing process. The Fund I asset is also under contract for $26 million. Looking forward, we expect to put another $100 million in wholly-owned and $150 million in Fund I assets into the market in the next quarter.","Shifting to the transaction market overall, dollar volume in the U.S. is up about 10% to 15% on a year-over-year basis while the absolute number of trades is about the same. In our markets, the number of trades is actually down about 10% as a result of simply fewer listings in the market. That being said, listing volume has picked up in the past month or so. Buyers continue to be aggressive and are sourcing different types of debt to maintain equity yields given the recent rise in the 10 year treasury. For example, some buyers have shortened their fixed rate term to 7 years to produce all-in rates in the mid-4s. Others are using variable rate debt, which spreads over LIBOR in the range of 225 basis points, resulting in initial rates below 3%.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom for his remarks. Tom?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Thanks, Sean. As Tim mentioned, I'll share a few comments on our revised outlook, the development pipeline and our capital needs. With regards to the outlook, Tim noted the overall strength of apartment fundamentals and this certainly contributed to our revised higher earnings outlook, particularly related to the NOI growth assumptions. Our overall operating FFO outlook improved by $0.01 from the interim outlook provided in April and improved $0.15 from the initial outlook.","As compared to the interim outlook, the table included on our press release notes that $0.06 contributed by higher projected NOI growth was partially offset by higher overhead of $0.02 and then $0.03 related to changes in our financial plan, including reduced acquisitions, interest will increase line use, an adjustments to the mark-to-market on Archstone debt.","From our original outlook, the $0.15 increase is primarily due to improved NOI from operating assets of about $0.10, and this was driven by the 60 basis points increase in our same-store NOI growth outlook, as well as the related improvement from our stabilized assets and lease up communities. Lower overhead provide another $0.04. And finally, reduced interest expense from refinancing less assumed debt and changes in acquisition or disposition activity contributed another $0.01.","It's important to note that of the NOI improvement, 70% is from higher than expected revenue with the balance coming from expense savings.","Just a quick comment on our third quarter outlook. The third quarter now reflects loss settlement cost of $53 million that was previously expected to be expensed in the fourth quarter. This, and other small nonroutine items pertaining to Archstone combined, says that third quarter adjusted FFO is expected within the range of $1.60 to $1.66 per share.","Turning to development. It was once again an active quarter. We delivered 3 new communities for a total capital cost of about $135 million. These communities were completed ahead of schedule and are producing rents that are about $150 above pro forma. The weighted average initial stabilized yield on these communities is nearly 100 basis points ahead of our original expectations. We also started 3 communities with over 700 apartments for an expected investment of $150 million.","Tim noted that we expect strong operating fundamentals to continue as the year progresses, and given our recent experience with leasing activity, these fundamentals bode well for the communities we expect to start leasing in the second half of the year.","We continue to be active with Development Rights pipeline, adding 9 new Development Rights with over $700 million in projected capital investment. Year-to-date, including opportunities acquired in the Archstone transaction, we've added 19 Development Rights, with about $1.75 billion in projected capital investment. Today, our pipeline stands at $6 billion, a $3 billion increase over the last 3 years. Current pipeline is more geographically diverse, with roughly 1\/3 of the pipeline now in the West Coast compared to just over 20% 3 years ago. Product type and market allocations also evolved as the cycle has matured, as our pipeline is more weighted towards suburban locations and garden product than it was 3 years ago.","Since 2012 , we completed more than $800 million of development at a weighted average yield greater than 7.5%. We estimate that this activity produced nearly $400 million of shareholder value when considering current cap rates. Today, we're building new product for about $280,000 a door, while our stabilized portfolio was valued closer to $300,000 -- $330,000 a door. Clearly, we continue to find opportunities in the market and are producing significant value through our development platform.","Turning to Capital Markets. This development activity requires funding, and we mentioned last quarter, we've increased our disposition and decreased our acquisition plans for the year. We now expect about $900 million of wholly-owned dispositions this year. About half of this activity has been completed, and we're projecting about $100 million of acquisition activity not yet identified. Based on these assumptions and other investment activities, our external capital requirements are modest at approximately $300 million. Our credit facility has ample capacity to fund this need, or we can opportunistically tap in equity markets as opportunities present themselves or, of course, sell additional assets.","With those comments, I'd like to turn the call back to Tim.","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, thanks, Tom. So in summary, our portfolio performance continues to be strong, and based upon occupancies in the 96% plus range and healthy demand expectations, it's well-positioned to absorb new supply at this point in the cycle. Our development pipeline is just beginning to add meaningful FFO and NAV growth, and our balance sheet is well-positioned to fund this external growth over the next few years.","As we discussed on Investor Day, we believe that our capital allocation track record and organization capability sets us apart. Our ability to raise, deploy, grow and manage capital in a value-added manner has led to a significant outperformance over the last couple of cycles across every important metric, including total shareholder return, as well as per share FFO, NAV and dividend growth. While all companies have benefited to some extent from improving fundamentals over the last 2 to 3 years, we are now in the stage of a cycle where companies that are able to add value in various ways of their business models will separate themselves from the pack in terms of performance. We are excited about the prospects for the industry over the next few years. But equally as important, we're excited about our competitive position and our ability to leverage key capabilities to continue to deliver long-term outperformance.","And with that, operator, Alan, we are ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question in queue comes from the line of Jana Galan.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You had very impressive occupancy gains across all your markets, and I was just curious if this was the result of the stronger job growth and demand? Or is it part of your strategy to keep occupancy high, as we see these first waves of new supply hit the market?","Sean J. Breslin","Jana, this is Sean. Really, 2 things. One is we typically run at a higher occupancy platform. Certainly, that is fueled by healthy demand. The job numbers have a been a little bit better than expectation, which has supported that. But also there's a little bit of a seasonal component to it, first off, so that we're typically building occupancy through the first quarter, end of the second quarter, as we start to push rate harder, which is something that you saw on the second quarter. And then as we get into the back half of the year, we will also try to be building a little bit higher occupancy platform as we go into the slower season through the winter. And as you're talking about supply, that is something that we consider more from a tactical point of view within specific submarkets based on anticipated lease up activity and when those deliveries start to occur. It's not necessarily a global strategy if you want to call it that, it's much more tactical in nature based on local conditions.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just on the development pipeline and on big focus of the first quarter call with rising construction costs. Just curious in terms of kind of the new rates that you're buying in land parcels, how are you thinking about future construction costs and yields?","Timothy J. Naughton","Jana, this is Tim. In terms of construction costs, they're basically back to the prior peak. So while they've gone down between 20%, 25%, depending upon the product type, they're basically are back to peak. It depends on whether you're talking about concrete or wood frame construction. They -- it varies a little bit. But in terms of underwriting, we continue to underwrite the way that we always have. It's a little difficult to project construction costs on something that may take 3 or 4 years to get through the entitlement process. And so we do look at it as really on a current yield basis as if we were building it today and delivering it to the market today and leasing it up. And to the extent we have a view about construction costs and the direction of the market, whether it's rents or construction cost. So that impacts, maybe at the margin, the kind of yields we might look for, but it's more at an intuitive level, I would say, than analytical level. It's really -- it probably helped shape more how we think about how aggressive we want to be as opposed to any particular deal.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from the line of David Toti.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just have a sort of a high-level question, you covered a lot of detail in the call. But when you think about the acceleration in the development pipeline sort of higher volumes, a bigger overall investment, maybe it's not supply or absorption or job creation that causes you to pause, maybe it's the disruption in the capital markets, potentially higher cost of capital down the road. How do you weigh those 2 sort of macro factors relative to deciding to move forward with an even higher volume of product deliveries?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, David, maybe I'll start and, Tom, feel free to jump in. I guess where I'd start, higher capital cost could impact not just -- that just doesn't impact development, your development strategy, it impacts your stabilized portfolio, right. And as Tom mentioned in his comments, we're delivering new product for 280-a-door versus -- our 17-year-old stabilized portfolio is worth 330 340 a door. So if can only own one of those portfolios, I think you prefer the one that's $280,000 a door and brand-new. So while it factors in at some level, David. It's I would say probably replacement cost is a bigger driver in terms of how we're thinking relative to current phase, how we think about overall level of development. But certainly, it factors how we finance a development as we're starting. And Tom, maybe just touch on that a little bit in terms of some of the things we're doing from a matching standpoint.","Thomas J. Sargeant","Sure. Well, David, as you probably heard me speak to in the past, we have something that we've dubbed integrated capital management, which generally requires or generally a guideline is that we've matched fund our starts as they happen through either equity and debt or dispositions or some mix of capital. If there were a disruption in the Capital Markets, unless it's a protracted disruption, it would really impact future starts. We think that this risk is substantially mitigated by this integrated capital management program or the concurrent funding of our development activity with new capital. So I guess it is a concern. It's one that we always raise, and I think we presented at our Investor Day, our long-term look at liquidity, as well as our short-term look. But we think the way we run the balance sheet and the way we have this structured program in place really substantially mitigates the risk that could come from a disrupted Capital Market.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just touching on -- the yield appear to have compressed a bit in the most recent -- in the recent quarter, and I guess, is this or as they say a sort of a spot compression? Is this something we can kind of expect to continue into the end of the year as you sort of push more of this product and more of this development starts through? Or can we start to expect to see that begin to widen out a bit towards year end?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, David, there's interplay of a few things happening there. First of all, I think as Tom mentioned in his remarks, more of the pipeline is West Coast-oriented over the last 2 or 3 years, which generally is lower yielding -- lower cap rate, lower yielding developments. Roughly East Coast deals, you underwrite the current yields of, call it, high 6% or 7%, West Coast closer to 6%. So you're getting a little bit of that waiting, a little bit of a mix issue that's driving the average projected yield. And then, we just don't have that many deals in lease-up right now. I think out of the 27 that are listed on there, there's maybe 7, 8, 10 that are in lease up. And so as deals start to come to market in terms of lease-up, just given the momentum and strength we've seen in the market, we actually would expect to see some of those yields come up. I think we actually have 6 or 7 starting lease-up in the third quarter alone. So the combination of maybe a bit more West Coast coming in that generally have lower yields and in starting to ramp-up the leasing activity in Q3 and Q4, I think you're going to see a little bit of interplay between those 2 factors that are may be working in a little bit opposite direction.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question, are you guys seeing any change in the appetite at the municipal level when you go through the zoning, permitting, staging, you're obviously trying to increase density and change some land parcel zones. Are you seeing any resistance at this point at that level to new supply for apartment product given a pretty big jump in construction levels sort of more broadly?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, I guess a few comments. A lot of the increase in production has been in urban submarkets. And generally, the installment process is not as intense. You don't have the same kind of level of an NIMBYism in the urban submarkets as you do in the suburban markets. Then the other thing I'd say, a lot of the stuff that's been produced or started to date were deals that were already entitled or had partial entitlements in place before the downturn. So they just weren't as politically charged. Having said that, I mean, there are some -- I think we've mentioned the last couple of quarters, we're kind of refocusing back in the suburbs, in many cases sort of business back to usual, creating value through the entitlement process. And there are some projects that we're involved with as well as I'm sure some of our peers that kind of back -- slugging through the entitlement process and working through that over a 2, 3, 4 year period. So is it more charged than it was at the end of the last cycle? These things tend to be a little cyclical in nature, and there's still a dearth of activity generally as it relates to construction in the Northeast where it tends to be more political, they aren't -- most municipalities aren't search rateable, and so they've been a little bit more accommodating, I would say, generally, in terms to a multifamily proposal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Many comments on the call today about how you're doing better versus last year's pace, whether it's renewals or lease-up pace or development yields. And I'm curious, what do you think, are there macro events driving that? Are you as a company more confident to push rents more significantly? What should we read into an improvement versus what were very good conditions last year to this current year?","Timothy J. Naughton","Rich, there's a lot of things. I mentioned in my remarks about sort of a growing housing shortage. I think we continue to see that sort of that excess inventory burn off over last year. Obviously, there's more new rental supply coming into the market this year than there was last year, but on the other hand, there's just less overall housing start demand. I think household formation is estimated to be about 1.4 million this year versus total delivery, total housing delivery, single-family and multifamily, less than a million. And so I think you're seeing a little of supply demand dynamic play out a little bit and benefit the rental sector. But importantly, one of the things we try to really press upon analysts and investors is we don't really see this cycle looking like the 2000 cycle, where it was just -- it went up and then it went down. And as we've talked about, we think this is more similar to the '90s where you had a -- what we think is a likelihood of a more sustainable economic expansion mixed by more stable supply growth. And as a result, we would expect sort of rental rate dynamics to sort of move up and down through the course of the cycle as opposed to one direction up and one direction down, which we experienced in the 2000. So I think what we're seeing is just a little bit more of the -- similar to how the '90s played out, frankly.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So if you were, to say, what inning you would have thought you were in this time last year, let's just say fourth inning of this cycle, is that -- are you saying you can actually have reversed an inning this time around and gone to the third inning? I mean, maybe a funny way of thinking about it, but is that kind of what you're saying, it kind of goes up and down that way?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes. I mean some folks might feel that way, I don't think that's how we felt. I think we just view that the expansion is likely to be a longer expansion just given frankly the depth of the correction. And there are quite a few similarities with coming out of the late '80s or early '90s in terms of the depth of what we've gone through. And just given the condition of corporate and consumer balance sheets and the deleveraging that we've seen. In many ways I think we felt, we sort of view this as being more lock and loaded for our longer expansion than frankly the 2000s, which was driven as much, I think, by a fairly accommodative monetary policy as true underlying fundamentals.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. One of your comments was made about supply, and you said that you're not worried about it because there's a lack of condo component to those supply numbers. I'm wondering why that's a good thing, assuming that condo development will start to happen, why would we be happy to hear that 250,000 units is all multifamily. Wouldn't it be worse if -- wouldn't it be better if some of that was condo right now?","Timothy J. Naughton","I guess the point I was trying to make, if you look over the 2000 cycle, I was comparing apartment starts with prior apartment starts, okay. So they both are on 2 50 -- 2 25, 2 50 range. But we have -- what we have last cycle is we have 75 to 100,000 condos. It's about 75,000 condos a year. I think we're under 10,000 right now as a start rate on new condos. And so, total multifamily supply is actually less than what we've seen -- we saw last cycle, that was the point I was trying to make, Rich.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, got it. Last question is, if you can have a broad comment on the fledgling business of single-family rentals. We have some companies now out there. To what degree do you find yourself concerned about that business as a competitive pressure for AvalonBay in the industry?","Sean J. Breslin","Rich, this is Sean. Just based on the data that we track, we don't see many of our residents moving out to buy -- to rent single-family homes. Typically, it's just a different household type. And I think a lot of studies have concluded that a lot of the people that were homeowners, that were foreclosed out, et cetera, they became single-family renter or occupants as opposed to people in multifamily moving to single-family for rental purposes. There's certainly some percentage of that, but it's pretty negligible in terms of the data that we track, so we're not overly concerned about it right at this moment.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Do you think it's a good business?","Sean J. Breslin","Hard to opine on that, we don't have any experience with it. So probably it wouldn't be wise to share an opinion.","Timothy J. Naughton","Rich, it's Tim. I think it's good for the consumer. I think what Sean is alluding to, it's not -- it's unproven, I guess, from an operator standpoint. I guess it's kind of in the question out there as to whether somebody can really scale this thing and be able to operate in a really profitable and efficient manner. But I think it's a good thing from a consumer standpoint, right, in terms of having a more professional operator than your uncle who may be their landlord. So my guess is, a couple will figure it out and be able to make a business out of it.","Operator","And your next question in queue comes from the line of Karin Ford.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just following up on that condo question. I think, Sean, we had talked a little bit at NAREIT about potentially seeing some -- the beginnings of some condo conversion activity of rentals. Are you still seeing that and do you think that will be a growing trend here as the housing market continues to recover?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Karin, this is Sean. What I think I indicated at NAREIT is there was some chatter about that and there had been 1 project that we were aware of in the mid-Atlantic where that had occurred, a small project. There continues to be a chatter about the potential conversion of multifamily, particularly communities that are under construction where a condo developer doesn't have to design something and then go through the process to construct it over 2 years and sort of have readily available inventory. So the major urban centers is likely where you're going to see that happen first. That has not happened yet to our knowledge, other than the 1 community I mentioned, but there continues to be increasing chatter about that. So I wouldn't be surprised to start to see some of that activity occur over the next 12 months. We just don't have actual transactions occurring just yet.","Timothy J. Naughton","And Karin just to add, I mean, the one area -- the couple of markets we're seeing a little -- some purpose built condos are starting to see a little bit in San Francisco and New York, and that may be an indication of where -- intuitively, it matches kind of what we're seeing just in terms of home prices versus rents where condo conversions might make sense sooner rather than later.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And Tim, I think you had talked in your -- in beginning of the year about considering a possible reacceleration of growth in 2014 as you said as new supply sort of reaches its peak and, hopefully, job growth is getting better. As the economy gets better and, as you said, as the second quarter revenue growth was higher than the first quarter already, this quarter, are you still thinking about that? Do you think it could happen potentially sooner than you had previously thought?","Timothy J. Naughton","Perhaps. I guess it was really a broader comment, again, kind of going back to my response to Rich's question. You going to go back to the 1990s, you had years there, growth rates moved up 100 or 200 basis points and then moved down 100 or 200 basis points the following year. My comments the beginning of the year were really geared towards, we saw supply starting to level off. We think that the peak is likely to be in '14 rather than '13, which I think I said in our market, 2013, we have seen some supply get delayed and get deferred into 2014. So we actually think the peak is going to be in the first half of 2014, at least in our markets, and a little bit later than that nationally. But at a time when we had expected, as the private sector started to get on a more sustainable expansion path, that we expect the job growth to pick up, and that actually has happened sooner than we'd anticipated, 200,000 jobs per month versus, I think, the consensus was 135,000 to maybe 150,000 for the first half year. So in that respect, I guess it could happen a bit sooner, but again, it was really as much about we see this thing as being a more sustained level of performance than sort of a prototypical, cyclical up and then down.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. My last question is just on the Archstone portfolio. I heard you say that it's still doing better than you had expected on the top line. Can you just give us some statistics on where occupancy stands and where renewal and new lease increases have been in that portfolio?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure, Karin. This is Sean. In terms of occupancy, as you may know, Archstone's rental community is a little bit lower occupancy platform than what we typically run. So they've been running in the low 95s, which is consistent with the way Archstone has been running at. As I think I may have mentioned in the first quarter call, their revenue management strategy was a little bit different, and we are looking at what they've been doing in 2 particular markets just to get a sense of their strategy in those markets relative to ours and some comparisons in terms of how we manage the revenue management system. So those communities continue to run in the low 95s consistent with that experience as compared to ours in the 96 range. In terms of rent change, what I can tell you right now is that out of the 6 major regions that we operate in, as we have started to track rent change, and keep in mind, this is 1 quarter of data at this point, about half the regions, the Archstone communities are outperforming, including the Mid-Atlantic by the way, and the other half, the AvalonBay Communities, are outperforming. That's just 1 quarter of data in terms of what's happened. What we're going to be trying to look for over the next 3 or 4 quarters is sort of what's behind that and is it mainly submarket differences or is it really a difference in strategy that's driving that. So the rent change differences aren't material in most cases, but that gives you some perspective for sort of the half and half at this point. But we probably need 3 or 4 more quarters of trend to be able to give you more precise information.","Operator","Next in queue we have the line of Nick Joseph.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Did you see any differences in terms of same-store growth in the second quarter between your different brands?","Sean J. Breslin","Nick, this is Sean. At this point, we're not providing a lot of information on the performance of the specific brands. It's a little too early given that some of the communities have just now been rebranded over the last 6 months or so to be able to provide information in that regard. So our anticipation is that at some point, further down the road, we'll be able to provide that. What we can say right now is based on the communities that have been rebranded, for example the AVA communities, we are seeing more of the target audience at those communities. For example, like renovation communities, where we rebranded from Avalon to AVA, there typically has been a shift in the profile to be more AVA customers, which is something that is a good outcome. And our expectation is that if we're delivering the product and services that, that particular customer would desire, then there would be financial benefits associated with that over time and lead to outperformance. But the sample size is a little too small at this point and it's probably a little too early for the communities that had been rebranded to give you any conclusive data.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Tim, it's Michael Bilerman speaking, I'm not sure who would take this, but just thinking about development for a second and the significant ramp and growth in your own pipeline, but also your commentary about you're sort of seeing it peaking out by mid next year, I'm just curious, who you see is as others that have also been ramping their pipelines and sort of why you think they may also slow down or not start as much, why you sort of don't see if improving capital markets and the demand is there, why you don't see that others with access to be able to develop won't continue it even if you're being more disciplined?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, Mike, I think it's a good question and maybe it's important to differentiate here between our markets in more national and some of the more less supply-constrained markets. I think there are a few things that work. One, we talked about rising construction cost. And so I do think, particularly, somebody does have kind of platform that we've got just from terms of managing costs, I think the economic's going to probably look a little bit more strained. But I think importantly, in our markets, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of the deals that were gotten done were deals that were either entitled or partially entitled or had infrastructure in place. And it's between 2 million and 4 million of pursuit cost just to get it in ground and to an average deal in our markets, and that's back to the kind of deals that we're looking at today and putting into the pipeline as opposed to something that's relatively close to being already to go. So I think that is still keeping some folks away from some of our markets, or at least they're taking a more balanced view in terms of their own footprint, where capital, their capital sources, if they're private guy, maybe pushing them more towards the Coast, with the resurgence of some of the Southeast and South Western markets and ability to leverage that, their own capital, that sponsor capital, across a bigger development pipeline in some of those markets. I think to the extent that you get more supply, it's likely to be in those markets for those reasons. But in terms of others that are ramping up, I mean, we have seen it probably more among the -- either the publics or those private guys that had really well-established platforms, before had good track records and been able to get the capital come along side them. I think those are the guys that hopefully or maybe paying a little bit closer attention to the transparency and the metrics that are out there in the public arena that are being provided by guys like you in terms of informing some of their business decisions at the margin.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful color. Just one lastly, on Lehman, so they're open to sell again, it's 60 days past the last offering, is that correct?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Yes, Michael, this is Tom. That's correct.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And would you ever use, I guess now that the stake's has been cut down to just over 5%, would you ever -- would be selling more assets and recognizing that you have significant development on the com [ph] , would you ever use liquidity to maybe take out the rest of that stake on a buyback perspective? Is that something that you would entertain at this point, now that the first slug is done?","Thomas J. Sargeant","It really is a capital allocation question, and as we sit here today, we think our development pipeline is the most attractive asset class to allocate capital to. We think our stock -- we think there's obviously opportunity in the stock today, but there's probably more return to be had from allocating that capital to development. So as we sit here today, we would not be interested in buying back those shares only because we like the opportunities from development that are in front of us.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from the line of Rob Stevenson.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Can you talk about what you were seeing in terms of the spread between where you send out renewals and what you wind up netting and how that sort of trended over the last year?","Sean J. Breslin","Rob, this is Sean. It does trend throughout the year a little bit differently, but right now, what we're seeing is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 basis points in terms of the initial offers relative to what's actually signed, and that's been pretty consistent the last couple of months. And so I mentioned, for example, in July that renewals are actually trending to about 6%. They went out right around 7% and then August and September are going out in the low 7s. Typically, when we're in late in the second quarter and third quarter, when we're pushing pretty hard, those trends tend to widen a little bit and then narrow as we go through the winter and we're slightly more conservative. So on average it's usually somewhere in the 60, 65 basis point range, but it does move around given the season.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then I guess, Tom, how many of the Fund I assets are left when you get fund selling the 26 million that you have under contract and the 150 that you guys expect the market?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, this is Sean again. That is about $350 million in total volume that needs to go out represented by about 11 assets that are left, and our expectation is that we'd be selling somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% to 50% of that, the remainder of this year, and then the balance in 2014, Rob.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then how much of the Fund II assets are still left?","Sean J. Breslin","Pretty much the whole portfolio. We only sold 1 asset out of that particular fund. So originally, we had a total of 13 assets, and we have 12 now. It's about $800 million or so cost basis.","Operator","Next in queue we have the line of Alexander Goldfarb.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. Just in thinking about you guys as you ramp up the dispositions. If we look back over the past sort of 8 years or so, Fairfield County, New Haven has never really been a leader revenue. In fact, it's lagged towards the back. So apart from sort of providing divorcee housing or home remodeling housing, just sort of curious why that market should continue to be in the portfolio or receive further capital investment given that you guys get better growth in other parts of the portfolio?","Sean J. Breslin","Alex, this is Sean. Probably a couple of things to keep in mind. One is if you look back over the long period of time, we have still some assets in that market in Stamford, in particular, I know of 2 or 3 assets we sold, going back 6, 7 years ago. So we've sold down some. But the other thing to keep in mind in terms of just Fairfield overall is the development has been highly accretive. So it's not just the growth rate that we're looking at, but we're looking at the total returns. As we talked about in Investor Day in terms of how we're allocating capital, so if we can continue to put yields on the book that are 6.5%, 7.5% range in that market, even if the growth is not quite the same as San Jose, as an example, total return still makes sense, particularly when trading cap rates in that region are probably in the low 5s. So you got to still look at both sides of it in terms of that initial investment and growth rate in terms of what the return looks like. But to the extent that we see opportunistic dispositions in the Fairfield County, we definitely would be executing.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then second question is for Tom. You guys have about $44 million of year-to-date Archstone expenses in your guidance, it's $0.75 for the full year or roughly, what, about $95 million. So what's the split for the third and fourth quarter or some of these expenses been housed elsewhere other than that Archstone expense line?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Yes. Alex, we didn't parse out -- we've given you guidance for the entire amount of the acquisition cost of capitalized and expensed. It really hasn't changed that much since our original outlook or, I'm sorry, since the first quarter update and we didn't parse that out between the third and fourth quarter other than what I mentioned on the call today in terms of the swap online and some other minor acquisition-related costs. So we did give the full year outlook at 6 30 and we've provided reconciling information so that you can understand the difference between FFO and AFFO and substantially, all of that difference is the Archstone transaction and relating cost.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next in queue we have the line of Nicholas Yulico.","Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research","Sort of bigger picture question, I mean, I'm wondering how you guys are thinking about the size of your development pipeline, how it might change in the face of what we're now seeing to be a more likely shifting interest rate environment, especially since it's taking at least, say, 2 years to build stabilized assets?","Timothy J. Naughton","Nick, this is Tim. I think we talked about that at Investor Day. And I think there's plenty of time we've gotten together with analysts and investors, we kind of think of the development pipeline at least from a guardrail standpoint, kind of being in that 10% to 15% of total enterprise value range. We're trending towards the top end of the range, but as we said, we think we see that flattening out over the next year. But maybe more directly, to your question, I think it impacts how you think about optioning land versus buying land. And the more that you can -- I think it puts more pressure to think about optioning versus being willing to take land on your balance sheet. If rates continue to move up, you do have the opportunity some times to renegotiate land if it's optioned as opposed to it's being owned, so the economics makes sense. Having said all that, our total land inventory today is, if you look at land owned and land optioned, it only represents about 19% of total projected capital investment for the development right portfolio. So it really -- I think it really comes down to more kind of how you manage risk in terms of that land inventory, make sure you're not buying it at hopefully peak values if you're taking it on your balance sheet and make sure you're being smart about how you option as you go through the entitlement process as well.","Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just one other question on Brooklyn, I was wondering how much of the kind of accelerating rent growth you're seeing in New York City is being driven by the Brooklyn asset and what's the latest on when you might be able to start Willoughby Square?","Sean J. Breslin","Nick, this is Sean. I can talk a little bit about, Fort Greene, I think you're referring to, and then Tim could comment on Willoughby. But Fort Greene is one of our assets in the city, and it has been -- my recollection is the average rent growth there on a year-over-year basis is in the 6% range, I can double check that and get back to you, but that's my recollection, sort of slightly above the market average, and the property that's been outperforming the most is Morningside Park, which is up near Columbia. That property has done exceptionally well in the first 2 quarters, is leading the New York City portfolio overall.","Timothy J. Naughton","Nick, this is Tim. In terms of the start of Willoughby, we actually do anticipate starting it this quarter and we've actually finalized our budgets and actually anticipate mobilizing fairly quickly on that deal.","Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research","Is there anything you could say about -- kind of think about the cost of that project at this point?","Timothy J. Naughton","No. We'll be disclosing it on the -- when it starts, we'll be disclosing the economics of -- in terms of cost and projected rents at that time. I just don't have it in front of me.","Operator","Next in queue, we have a question from the line of Jeremy Mith [ph].","Unknown Analyst","Earlier you guys talked about buyers using different debt structures given the move in the 10 year. Anecdotally, we've heard that well cap rates haven't moved yet, necessarily, the pool of potential buyers. Your core product has started to shrink a bit, which theoretically could create more opportunities given your capital advantages. Just wonder if you've seen this as well. And secondly, has the treasury move caused any increase in product come into markets as buyers come off to sideline ahead of potential further rate increases?","Sean J. Breslin","Jeremy, this is Sean. As it relates to your first question about core buyers, we've sold core assets this year both of those were executed prior to the recent rise in the treasury. But we also have assets that are on contract right now. And based on what we've seen, the pool of core buyers hasn't changed dramatically. It's come down maybe a little bit off of last year, but we're talking nominal percentages, not material. And when you're selling a core asset and a lot of these are bigger assets for us, everything we've sold that's core is $100 million plus. And typically the pool of buyers is 5 to 8 players. That hasn't changed dramatically, maybe it was 10 last year as an example. When it comes down to a typical, there's a top 5 or so that are really competing for deals of that size. And then as it relates to your second question about product, yes, over the last month, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have seen listing volume increase. Can you put your finger on it to say it's as a result of the movement in the treasury? It's possible. But it's hard to explain every individual seller's motivation, but the trend is that there has been a recent spike in activity, yes.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. Appreciate the color. And then just one final one. You talked about adding development rights and construction cost back to peak, can you just give a little bit of color on land pricing trends and whether yourself or developers, more generally, are taking on entitlement in zoning risk?","Timothy J. Naughton","Jeremy, Tim. You're not seeing land, for the most part, trade before it's entitled, unless it's rates at a steep discount that's usual because there's some level of distress or somebody had a liquidity need. So for the most part, people are, including us, are able to option land still and get some time, whether it's 18, 24 months, sometimes longer, to get the major entitlement, so that the larger entitlement risk is behind. You may have to take down a property 6 months, 9 months before you're ready to pull a building permit, but it's not -- you don't have any entitlement risk in front of you at that point. So I'm not seeing any huge appetite and most of our markets is to just buy land and put on the balance sheet and then pursue entitlements or need to do that.","Operator","Next in queue, we have the line of Paula Poskon.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a quick question about what you're seeing in the field. Just given all of the new supply that is coming, are you seeing any pressure on wages or challenges in terms of retention and recruiting at the property level?","Sean J. Breslin","Paula, this is Sean. To answer your question, there are specific submarkets where if there is concentrated amounts of supply, there can be pressured particularly on the community consultants, the leasing consultants, that would put pressure on that in terms of, particularly, from the private operators more of the merchant builders where their model is really to get it least-up, highest rents and get it sold. It's more of a -- you think of it almost as just a capital cost or transaction cost as opposed to a steady-state operators. Most of the steady-state operators don't feed into that, they get a permit, business model, organization. They look at their compensation philosophies and stay pretty constant. So you see slight uptick and turnover at the community consultant level, that's typically where that would show up, but it's not material by any sense. It would be very submarket-driven and I could think of it in 2 submarkets for us right at the moment, but it's not material in any way.","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Tim Naughton for closing remarks.","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, thanks, Alan, and I thank all of you for being on the call today.

Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially.

The attachment is also available in on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q1 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin, and Matt Birenbaum. I'll provide management commentary on the slides that we posted last night, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. My comments will focus on providing a summary of the Q1 results, review of important macro trends impacting our business, an overview of market and portfolio performance, and finally some color on our approached development at this point in the cycle.","Starting now on slide 4. Highlights for the quarter include: core FFO growth of just over 6%; we saw same-store revenues grow at 3.2% or 3.4% including redevelopment. This was a little better than expected, driven by higher than expected occupancy in January and February. We had $650 million of development completions at an initial projected yield of 5.6% with about 70% of those attributable to the completion of Avalon Willoughby and the AVA DoBro combination community in Brooklyn. And lastly, we raised $460 million of capital including dispositions at an average initial cost of 3.7%.","Turning to slide 5 and some of the key trends we've been following. Given that the economy is essentially at full employment, and we're now roughly seven years into the current expansion, wage growth will be a key driver in sustaining apartment sector performance for the balance of this cycle. Over the last several quarters, workers have made solid gains in wages, as the labor market has tightened almost a 100 basis points of improvement in hourly wages as you can see on the chart on the left. And the trend is even stronger for younger workers who are those under 55 on the chart on the right. They're seeing gains closer to 150 basis points and are now enjoying year-over-year gains in hourly wages, up almost 4%.","Turning to slide 6, another trend we're tracking is the health and attitudes of the business sector, which can be a leading indicator of job and wage growth, as well as new capital investment. As you can see on the chart on left, corporate profits are now up in the three of the last four quarters and on the right, business confidence continues to rebound since the election late last year. So, it looks like the business sector is positioned to support continued economic growth over the near-term.","Slide 7, a third factor we're watching is the trend in the rate of homeownership as the for-sale recovery continues to take hold. Obviously, the apartment sector has benefited tremendously this cycle, as homeownership rates dropped roughly 500 basis points in the aftermath of the housing correction. But over the last two years or so, it appears that the homeownership rate has settled into the 63% to 64% range, consistent with the longer-term trend we saw before the housing market run up with the 2000s. As we stated last quarter for a variety of reasons, we do expect housing demand to be more balanced going forward, between for sale and rental as well as single and multifamily.","Moving to slide 8, given the outlook for balance housing demand, we continue to keep an eye on the supply side of the equation. Based on recent trends and housing starts, the housing industry has responded in a very rational way to shifts in demand. Single family starts have risen significantly over the last two years on the order of 25% to 30% to roughly 800,000 units per year, while multifamily starts have essentially leveled off in the 400,000 unit range over that same period of time. This two-thirds, one-third ratio was roughly consistent with homeownership rates over the last couple of years and the 1.2 million in annual housing starts, less units lost to obsolescence or destruction is roughly in line with net household formation. So overall at the macro level, the housing market appears to be in good shape, a period of rough equilibrium. Of course, there are some imbalances in certain markets and sub-markets, but for now, the market in total remains healthy.","Now turning to slide 9 and taking a look specifically at our markets. Rent growth in AVB's markets has been roughly stable over the last couple of quarters in the low single digit range. As you can see in this chart, rent growth effectively peaked in mid-2015 in the 5% range and has decelerated to the 1% to 2% range since then. In our portfolio, we're seeing similar trends with blended like term rent change averaging 1.7% in Q1, and at 2.3% so far in April. Rent growth in suburban submarkets continues to outperform urban by more than 300 basis points across our footprint, which is consistent with the trend over the last couple of years, as the urban supply has been roughly double that delivered in the suburbs.","Turning to slide 10, the discrepancy between urban and suburban rent performance is evident in most of our markets, where we have a diversified presence across the region. This slide that depicts rent growth performance for three of our larger regions: Northern California, Metro New York\/New Jersey and Boston. As you can see on this chart, in these regions, urban rent growth is underperforming by about 200 bps to 400 bps. A trend that is consistent with our portfolio for these regions where roughly 40% of our portfolio by value is urban, and rent growth has been more than 200 basis points, so lower for communities in urban submarkets.","Turning to slide 11, so given some of these macro and operating trends, how are we thinking about new development? While we continue to pursue new development, although in a more risk measured way than early in the cycle, the last few slides speak to some of the actions we're taking to manage risk in the development platform. First, as you see here, overall volume has peaked and is projected to decline by roughly 30% or so over the next year from Q4's level of $4 billion. In addition, the composition of what is underway is projected to change, skewing more toward infill, mid-rise, and away from downtown high-rise product where market conditions as we just discussed have softened more significantly.","Turning to slide 12. In addition, we remain disciplined about managing land inventory. We talked about this last quarter as well. We currently have about $100 million in land inventory, almost a record low as a percentage of enterprise value. The seven parcels that we own for new development represent only a quarter of our development rights, with the other three-quarters being controlled through purchase contracts. In addition, five of those seven parcels are scheduled to start construction over the next couple of quarters. So we don't have much land exposure currently, and it's our intention to maintain this land-light posture for the balance of the cycle.","Now to slide 13, we're also managing development risk with the right hand side of the balance sheet through our funding strategy. At quarter end, we're almost 90% match funded, with only about $0.5 billion in additional permanent capital needed to fully fund the $4 billion in production.","And lastly, on slide 14, spot liquidity remains very healthy. In fact before considering the impact of any free cash flow, we have plenty of current liquidity to build out and complete the $4 billion pipeline under construction.","So in summary, Q1 played out more or less as expected. We believe that the apartment market has entered into a period of equilibrium, down-shifting a bit from exceptionally strong performance we experienced in the first few years of the cycle to something closer to longer-term trend. Many key macro trends continue to support this thesis but do bear watching as the cycle matures. And we continue to pursue growth primarily through new developments, but given where we are in the current cycle with moderating rent growth, an improving for-sale market and construction costs still on the rise, we are taking a more risk measured approach than in recent years.","And with that, Cynthia, we'd be happy to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. When you provided the mid-quarter update in early March, you indicated that you're running about 25 basis points ahead of initial expectations in terms of same-store revenue growth. Is that still the case today, I guess through almost the end of April?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Nick, this is Sean. It's a fair statement as it relates to Q1. Q2, obviously, we're just getting into the leasing season now. So, I'd say it's probably closer to par at this point when we look at what's happening in April and what we might anticipate through the balance of the quarter. But there's still a lot of transactions left to go here in the next 60 days. And occupancy is a little below where we were for the first quarter, about 10 basis points or so. So I'd call it probably closer to neutral than slightly up.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And just in terms of individual markets, are there any markets that are either materially outperforming or underperforming what you initially expected in guidance?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Material being the keyword there, Nick. I wouldn't say any of them are material at this point. Think about the volume of transactions in Q1, it's just not that heavy. The markets I'd point to that maybe are slightly below our expectations, right now, first probably is LA, the San Fernando Valley specifically. As you may recall, there was a sizable gas leak there last year and we achieved some pretty nice rents in that market. We're not achieving as much growth on top of those slightly higher rents than we would have hoped for. And I'd say it's a little bit weaker operating environment in Northern California as well, combination of job growth and the supply that we expected with more supply on the way. So those are probably the two that I'd point to that are maybe slightly below, and then on the other side slightly above, Pacific Northwest continues to perform quite well. Job growth has been healthy and then job growth in Boston has also been pretty healthy, pretty consistent with last year at this point, at least through March. And supply is relatively level and starting to moderate a bit in the urban core. So those two, probably slightly ahead and then the other two slightly behind.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Rich Hightower with Evercore.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Hey, good afternoon, guys. I want to go back to the Bay Area for a second there to follow up on Nick's question. When you look at Avalon's performance versus a couple of peers that have reported already this quarter as well, there was just a little bit of underperformance in your Bay Area revenue growth numbers versus what those companies reported. I'm wondering if there's anything peculiar to your geographic setup there relative to peers or something else about the portfolio that we should be aware of for the first quarter?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Rich, good question. Not necessarily. I mean, one thing to keep in mind as you compare across the peers is there are some, I'll call it, geographical differences in terms of how we account for different things. So if you think about rent change is an example of revenue growth. Everything that we have in terms of discounts, concessions, et cetera is in a contra revenue account, so it's really a net number. And if there's not anything flowing through the expense side of the house, that creates some differences. Whether you include redev or not, that creates some differences, things of that sort.","So you just have to sort of keep those things in mind. As it relates to the portfolio, there are some differences, probably too many to mention as it relates to this particular call, but I wouldn't say they are material enough at this point that you would point to, say, San Jose and say, what's the mix there that's creating significant variation. It is not dramatic in a market like San Jose. Some of us are more urban concentrated versus suburban, but you really have to dissect it in pretty good detail to get down to where those differences are.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","All right. That's helpful color. Second question here is on development. I appreciate the color in the presentation, as to the composition of the pipeline in terms of mid-rise versus high-rise and so forth. I just want to confirm that that is more a function of where you're building, that it's mostly suburban in the pipeline today, and could you confirm sort of the number or the portion of the pipeline that is suburban versus urban at this point?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure. This is Matt. Yeah, I think it is normally high-rises are in urban markets, and mid-rise and gardens are in suburban markets, there are some exceptions to that. But when you look at our development rights pipeline of the $3.4 billion, about two-thirds of it is mid-rise product and only about 25% of it is high-rise. The difference being an 8% garden, and when you look at it kind of on a location basis, about 35% of it's urban, and 65% of it's suburban, and when you look at our starts, this year they're all suburban.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question guys. Just carrying on that, the last answer there, if you were to look at the market and do your market intelligence around where you're developing or could develop, do you see a similar shift in the market towards suburban and mid-rise away from urban?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","This is Matt, again. I guess, certainly in terms of the supply being delivered in the next couple of years, no, we're seeing supply in our markets over the next couple of years roughly 2% of stock, and it's about 3% in the urban submarkets as compared to maybe 1.5% in the suburbs.","If you look out beyond that, the stuff, it might start this year. You might start to see a shift a little bit, but one of the reasons we like the suburbs, the suburban submarkets and why we think it really plays to our strength as a developer is that they are more supply constrained. And generally speaking, the entitlements process is more challenging, it's a longer more expensive process, where in a lot of the urban submarkets, the jurisdictions want the business, they want the growth, they want the tax revenues and if it works economic \u2013 the barriers in the urban submarkets tend to be more economic than regulatory. So, I wouldn't be surprised to see the composition of mix change a bit, but it is inherently a little more difficult to get those starts going in the suburbs.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","And then last quarter, you had a slight sort of detail in your thoughts on how revenue growth would progress through the year and had a little bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter, not sure if that was intended or not, but when you think about the outlook today, is that a similar way to first to think about how the year might phase?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Dennis. This is Sean. We don't have any reason to believe it'd be any different than what we anticipated as part of our outlook when we talked about it on the last quarter call.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Perfect. And then just last question for 1Q, did you give the new and renewal numbers for the quarter?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","I think Tim gave it on a blended basis in his prepared remarks, but in terms of the Q1 detail, Tim indicated the blended were unchanged for the quarter was 1.7%. Renewals were 4.2% and new move-ins were down 1%.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","All right. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good afternoon. Thanks. First question is just on supply. Can you just talk about what you saw happen in the first quarter, is supply in your markets or any particular markets slipping into second, third quarter? And then I guess what are your latest thoughts on 2018?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, Jeff. This is Sean. I can comment and then either Matt or Tim can jump in as well. But, I mean in terms of the supply that's being delivered in our markets and throughout the different quarters of the year, from a portfolio perspective, it's pretty even throughout the year. If you look at it in terms of market by market performance, it's a little bit different to give you some perspective as an example. The markets that we're projected to see an increase in deliveries as we move through the year includes San Francisco, the Pacific Northwest and Orange County, those that are going to come down a little bit as you might have imagined given where we are in the cycle aren't many, but it's little bit San Jose, a little bit Northern Virginia.","And then as you move into 2018, it's pretty level until you get to the back half of the year where you start to see things fall off in markets like New York City and San Francisco in the back half of 2018, but our experience would tell us based on what we've seen in the last several years and particularly given that the biggest concentration of supply is urban, which is product is more challenging to get delivered. We probably expect a relatively flat pipeline between the deliveries in 2017 and 2018 across the footprint with some minor deviations from market-to-market.","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hey, Jeff. It's Kevin here. Just to put in perspective. I think we've talked about somewhere between high 1% range to 2% range that we expect to be delivered in 2017 and 2018. And it's going to jump around quarter-to-quarter, but based upon our best estimate, it's somewhere between 40 bps a quarter to 55 bps a quarter, so it's pretty low. I know some out there is positive that they might expect to see it coming down more significantly later in the year, that's not our expectation.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then is that even a change from your thoughts from let's say a month or two ago? For some reason, I thought you guys are -","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","No.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No. Okay. And then just specifically Columbus Circle, can you just talk about that project and your comfort on expected returns?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, Jeff, I know we talked a lot about it last quarter, so not really any update from last quarter in terms of expected returns in rent. So I guess I'd just refer you back to the script there, but it's under construction. Retail, we are starting to gear up from a marketing standpoint, which I think Matt spoke to last quarter and there is really no update in terms of how we are thinking about the economics from what we laid out last quarter where I think we gave a fair bit of detail between retail and residential and the implied cost on each of the product types.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","And we'll next hear from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned that you saw acceleration in like-term rent change into April. I was just curious how the metrics for like-term rent change in the first quarter and April stacked up relative to last year and whether or not that you would expect the current year to, I guess, turn positive relative to last year's like-term rent change at any point this year?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. Austin, good question. If you look at it in Q1, rent change on a blended basis was down about 220 basis points compared to Q1 of 2016. We still need to expect to see some acceleration of rent change as we move through the leasing season here, particularly as you get into sort of the May through July portion of the year. But we are not expecting a rent change to exceed what we achieved last year given the outlook for both the demand and supply in our market, so I don't think. It would be a positive surprise to the extent that occurred and we may see an uplift later this year to the extent we see better job growth through the second quarter, but we're not expecting that as part of our original outlook. We did not expect that and we don't expect that today.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","No, that's helpful color. And then, just would love to hear you guys' thoughts on the revised 421a plan or the affordable New York plan. In terms of just the economics and what it could mean for potential pickup in permitting activity?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure Austin, this is Matt, I guess I can speak to that one. I think it's been expected for some time that there would be a new program. In fact, I think the betting was it would have happened a little sooner than it did happen. So, it's not hugely different than the prior program. There are some subtle differences. So I think you may see some deals that we're waiting on the program to pull their permits, so they could avail themselves of it. There has been very little rental product started in New York City really over the last three, four quarters I think. So, you might see a little bit of an uptick there, but we're certainly not expecting any dramatic surge, because the economics of starting new rental deals are still pretty challenging there with where construction costs and land values are.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And then just one last one. I was just curious in the release you guys mentioned that there was a change in the composition of your dispositions for the year. Could you just provide a little bit of additional detail as to what exactly that comment was related to?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure. This is Matt again. There are changes to that disposition pool typically throughout the year basically based on kind of market dynamics and market sentiment. So in this particular case, we thought we were going to sell one asset that was going to have a very large GAAP gain that was affecting EPS which is why it's called out there. And basically, we've replaced that asset in the plan with a different asset, which we believe will be met by a little bit deeper kind of buyer pool market, which has a different GAAP gain to it.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Is there any change in the volume of dispositions that you expect in terms of dollar value?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Not materially, no.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","And our next question will come from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. You mentioned the supply for your portfolio is starting to move to the suburban markets. Are you seeing demographic shifts favoring the suburban markets from the demand side, people looking for more space, looking to be next to the schools?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hey, Wes, Tim here. I think you may have misheard us. Actually, for 2017 and 2018 we're still expecting deliveries to be about twice what we \u2013 in the urban submarkets than the suburban submarkets. So we may have misstated it, but to just be clear. I think there was question as to beyond 2018, in terms of land deals that people are starting to see here today that might start over 2017, 2018, and deliver 2019 or 2020, might we see a bit of a shift to suburban? And the answer is yes. We might see a little bit of a shift there, but as Matt mentioned, we are seeing \u2013 the entitlements are more challenging there, so we don't necessarily expect to see a dramatic pickup in suburban supply as a result.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. What about from the demand side? I guess that's what I was trying to get at. So sorry if misheard you earlier.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","But do you see demand shifting to the suburbs with the aging demographic, people are saying, well, maybe it's now time to live in the suburbs, a lot more space, want to be next to (27:22). Any of that?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, no, it's a good question. I think you have two trends that are occurring that maybe take a little bit longer to play out. That's the leading edge of the millennials in the late 30s now, but the bulk of millennials are still 23 to 28. That's sort of the pig going through the python, if you will, and there's still a preference for that age cohort we think in the urban submarkets as we've seen in the last couple years. But combined with that you have kind of the potential of the downsizing boomers. And we think there's a good probability that that's going to create more demand in infill suburban kind of locations, that they're both kind of migrating to the same kind of geography, if you will, looking for the same kind of amenities, still kind of walkable lifestyle, but maybe more space in the case of an aging millennial and maybe a little less space and more walkability in the case of a downsizing boomer.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess if you would have to pinpoint when you \u2013 I mean there's a 300 basis point gap right now in effective rent growth between the suburban and urban. When do you see that I guess being close to each other? Will it be more of a late 2018 event, maybe 2019 event when you look at all these trends?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Just speaking for myself. I mean, again with supply being 2x in the urban markets \u2013 suburban markets and demand is not 2x, it's something significantly less than that. Maybe it's higher in the urban submarkets, but it's not twice what we're seeing in suburban markets. It's hard to see that those lines converge over the next couple years.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Fantastic. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","And our next question will come from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, everyone. Just wanted to go back to the discussion around the composition change. I thought I heard that one of the assets was switched \u2013 you're switching to a different asset that has a deeper buyer pool. Can you maybe comment on what you're seeing in terms of investor trends across the different buckets of your portfolio? Which are sort of seeing the weakest demand? And have you started to see cap rates expand in some of those weaker-demand parts of the portfolio?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, Vin. This is Matt. There hasn't been a lot of transaction volume in the market, particularly in our markets. In the first quarter I think transaction volume was down something like 35% or 40% year over year. So there's not a lot of data to go on yet. But it is an interesting market out there in the sense that some assets are meeting with incredibly deep demand, multiple rounds of offers. We're selling an asset right now in the Pacific Northwest where we had to go to three rounds, which we weren't expecting. So if you have the right asset in the right location with the right story, there's still a lot of capital looking to be placed.","Then there are other assets where if that story isn't there and doesn't line up with kind of the dry-powder capital that's on the sidelines, it can be a little more challenging. And we're just trying to respond to that. To tell you the truth, it's a little unpredictable. We've been a little bit surprised sometimes at which assets draw that deep pool and which don't, and we have a very large portfolio and so we had the opportunity to kind of trade on that.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Vin, it's Tim here. I think one of the challenges is probably a lot of market participants are behaving like we are to the extent they're seeing some softness in a particular kind of asset. They're just pulling the asset rather than accepting a lower price. So there's just not visibility to, whether on a composite basis cap rates have really moved, their valuations have moved at least at this point in the cycle.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But is there is any geographic trends that you can draw? So it sounds like it's maybe more asset specific, but are there any regions that are seeing weakness?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Certainly New York City is \u2013 because of all the stuff that's been discussed on this and prior calls, there's probably some of that kind of trophy money is little bit sidelined right now.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay, thanks. And then just maybe moving back to some comments in terms of markets that you expect supply to accelerate or decelerate. I didn't hear you comment on LA. And I think EQR said that they saw some peak deliveries here in the first quarter. Would you agree with that assessment, or do you think it's more ratable in LA from your perspective?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. This is Sean. Are you talking about 2017 specifically?","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, 2017.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Based on the data that we have in terms of how we track it, which as you may know is a little bit of bottoms-up from the field teams that we have there working deals every day as well as top-down from a market research group. It's relatively flat in LA. It actually increases a little bit according to the data that we have around 20 basis points, 25 basis points of inventory in Q1 up to around 35 basis points, 40 basis points of inventory by the time you get to Q4 in terms of LA proper. Little bit lower than that when you get into Ventura County, but we don't see it leveling off per se based on the data that we have.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And do you think, just looking at the leasing progress at Hollywood, only 15% leased, next stabilization is 2Q of 2018. Do you think that stabilization period is at risk given the supply that doesn't really come down in from your data's perspective and then obviously job growth there has been a little bit soft?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of our West Hollywood deal, as opposed to AVA Hollywood, which start construction not too long ago, we delivered the first building. We're getting ready to deliver the second building. Demand has been very healthy for that community. Rents are coming in substantially above what we expected. So it's a pretty unique building, a great location. We're not expecting any weakness for that specific asset whatsoever.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question will come from Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah, great. Thanks. So I want to go back to your prepared remarks about taking a risk measured approach on development and one of the reasons you mentioned was improvement in for-sale market. So I was wondering if do you have a view that you may actually start seeing an uptick in residents moving to buy homes, especially in the suburban markets where you are developing?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Gaurav, this is Sean. I'm happy to answer that and Tim could comment if he likes. But we've not seen that happen in the portfolio at this point. It's still well below long-term averages. We're running around 11% of move-outs, which is call it 700 basis points below sort of long-term trends. I think it's a fair expectation that over a period of time we'll start to see that pick up some. Very different in terms of the market composition of that when you think about places like San Francisco and New York in terms of what that housing looks like, price point, et cetera, as compared to, say, suburban towns up at Boston or in the Mid-Atlantic as an example. So you might start to see it move some, but we're not expecting it to accelerate dramatically just given the very high cost nature of the housing in our markets combined with what's happening in the financial markets in terms of mortgage availability and qualifying.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Gaurav, just to add to that. I mean right now, for-sale housing is appreciating faster than rents and then when you lay on top of that, I think as Sean was implying at the end, just higher potential interest cost, I mean the cost of housing is going up at a faster rate than rental housing. I think it will be interesting to see whether that for-sale demand, first-time buyer really materializes this cycle. Much likely, we're talking about young adults who've been living with their parents and we expect that to be a pretty big source of pent-up demand and that really has not materialized this cycle for the rental housing sector.","So we're still seeing kind of record level on a percentage basis kind of that millennial segment that haven't formed households yet and haven't decoupled with roommates and you kind of wonder where you might see some of the same behavior as it relates to that first-time homebuyer, but it's an open question for sure.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Great. And I guess as a follow-up, I was wondering if you could comment on the sale of land parcel in 1Q that was not included in previous outlook?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","This is Matt. I think you're referring to a land parcel that was impaired. I don't think it's been sold yet, but that's actually a property in Tysons Corner that we've owned for a long time that was brought in the last cycle. There is an existing warehouse on it, and we thought that that was a long-term play on that submarket with metro coming and new master plan coming in. And after holding it for a long time, we concluded that the costs to develop it, the proffers that were going to be required, and the margin environment there wasn't as attractive as we had hoped it might have been. So we're going to move forward in selling that parcel and basically recognize the current market value.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Just on that, just maybe as a follow-up. That was a piece of property that we held for investment and not for development. Beyond that parcel, we have I think $13 million of sort of seven or eight smaller parcels that we're still holding for investment in addition to the $100 million of land inventory that we're holding for development. So there is not much left beyond that. We really were trying to sort of get that cleared before the end of cycle. And honestly it's a bit of stark reminders to why we don't to be holding land going into the next downturn?","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Omotayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Good afternoon. I just wanted to talk about guidance for a little bit. So first quarter you were $209 million, second quarter midpoint at $210 million, so you're kind of around $420 million for the first half of the year and guidance was $844 million to $884 million. So it seems like you're trending towards the low-end as of this point. How do we kind of think about where you could end up at the end of the year given you're kind of tracking towards the lower end currently?","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hi, Tayo. This is Kevin. I guess just a couple points. First, as you may be aware, we don't update guidance on our first quarter calls just kind of as a matter of practice for a number of reasons, including factors that Sean mentioned. There is just not a lot of transaction activity that's occurred year-to-date that allows us a very reliable basis on which to sort of reforecast for the year and come up with guidance. So what we do instead is we give a mid-year reforecast in connection with our second quarter call. So that's when we'll be able to speak in a more detailed way about how we see the year laying out from a quarterly core FFO perspective, if you will.","The second comment I'd say is when you think about our business model and how development contributes to year-over-year growth and how the lease-up activity from development plays out across the quarters, it's typically the case that our core FFO growth is typically backend weighted. And when we gave guidance at the beginning of this year for development NOIs, you may recall in the attachment that we had during the fourth quarter release where we did provide our outlook for the year, I think we had development NOI of around $65 million. And if you look at sort of how that paces out over the year, that tends to sort of double each quarter.","So a lot of our sequential quarterly core FFO growth tends to come from lease-up NOI, and you'll typically see a pattern where a lot of our growth is back-end weighted. So the mechanic of simply taking the first quarter and then the guidance for the second quarter and doubling it will never really work for us because you'll always kind of come up with a much lower number than what we've typically had for the year.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","All right. That's helpful color. Thank you.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","And our next question will come from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hey. Thanks and good afternoon. Just quick first question, you have $0.08 of a debt gain in the second quarter, I know you are not talking about the full year guidance, but has there been a change to the capital program, because that compares to the $0.04 full year number that you had in February, just wanted to make sure I had my model right?","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Rich, this is Kevin, again. No, that number you see for the second quarter was part of our original budget. It relates to essentially a contemplated payoff of Fannie Mae Pool 2, which is something we picked up in the Archstone transaction. It's a November maturity. It opens for prior repayment on April 30. It's about $700 million in size, and so, that's an event that we expect to happen in the second quarter, and so there has been no change in that respect.","Overall, in terms of our capital plan, don't have an awful lot to say, we're still early in the year. The outlook at the beginning of the year, we contemplated about just under $1.7 billion of external capital, that's probably roughly where we're at, maybe we're a little bit tacking a bit low, but we raised $460 million in the first quarter and kind of our overall plan is still, while we don't announce with specificity what we expected to raise in the capital markets in advance, generally speaking, what we said then is probably in terms of our current plan is still true today, which is we expect most of that external capital to come in the form of debt, with the preference for unsecured debt. We may do some piece of our debt activity in the form of secured debt to support ongoing tax protection, that we picked up in the Archstone transaction, but most of our overall net capital, we expect will still be debt, and of that, most of that hopefully will be unsecured debt, so not a significant change there.","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","So then there could be some debt extinguishment losses later in the year, to get to that $0.04 net number?","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, there is a number of different moving pieces and sort of the core \u2013 and adjustments between NAREIT FFO and core FFO, obviously in the first quarter you saw a couple here we had a promote from Fund 2 of about $7 million, that is within our NAREIT FFO, but it's carved out from -","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","I got you.","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Then so, we had sort of the impairment that was added back to NAREIT FFO. If you look out through the balance of the year, we have additional promotes from Fund 2, so we're wrapping that up. Our intention is to sell the remaining two assets. And I think, we probably have in total a fair bit of promote activity coming through the transom over the balance of the year, that will be items that we carve out of NAREIT FFO and then we have \u2013 so I think for the full year, we have something on the order of about $23 million of promote income that is for the full year in our budget for the NAREIT FFO that'll be carved out for core FFO purposes and then we have some deferred financing cost write-offs for Pool 2.","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. I'll wait on that then for next quarter. Question more on the portfolio. On this kind of suburban shift that you guys have been undertaking for a little while now. I mean, how much is that a permanent condition? Are you willing to muscle your way through what will inevitably be a relatively negative environment for that strategy? Or is there some means by which you can alter the portfolio with some level of velocity to move with the punches? I'm just curious, how committed you are long-term to suburban real estate.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, Rich, I think as we said is we're actually agnostic. We're believers in our markets. And if you look over on a longer period of time, the reality is that suburban and urban rent growth more or less have been pretty equal. But there are differences at different parts of the cycle and across cycles at times. So currently our portfolio is probably 30% urban by market value and 70% suburban, but of that suburban, I'd say at least half of it, we think of it is really kind of infill, more kind of midrise suburban. And we're -","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Right.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","\u2013 as a developer and someone that leads with the development investment platform, we're looking for value. And so, our focus from a development perspective is where there's greater value, and it's been clear from a land standpoint over the last probably four years there's been greater value on the suburban side, and that will inevitably change. And at that point, we'll look more at urban opportunities. And I guess lastly, it sort of plays into maybe at the margin how you're thinking about dispositions where you think maybe some assets are out of sync with underlying intrinsic value, and you got to be willing to pull the trigger on some of those opportunistic plays as well.","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Same question on the quote-unquote \"land light strategy.\"","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Also even though it might go up in time, and it's kind of you said near record lows right now, but is that also kind of a permanent condition in the sense that maybe this is a vestige of some sort of lessons learned from the past downcycle when some impairments were taken and the like?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, I think our bias as always is try to tie things up with an option contract, a purchase contract, and try to close on the land as close to the time which it gets put into production as possible. But there will be times in the cycle if there's distress or dislocation that we can potentially take land down and put it on the balance sheet. We've got plenty of capacity to do that. If we think that makes sense, we'll consider that. We're not at that point, though, anywhere near that point at this point in the cycle. So really the comment was really about how we intend to behave through the balance of cycle until we do see some dislocation and disruption.","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Daniel Santos with Sandler O'Neill.","Daniel Santos - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one from me, just following up on developments. And apologies if you covered this earlier. Just given the rising cost of developments have driven a lot of development at the high end, wondering if you could talk a little bit more about ways that you might be able to sort of value engineer new development to develop at a lower price point for a broader audience?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","This is Matt. I guess I can take that one. It's an interesting question and one that we constantly are looking at. Are there opportunities to push building technologies that might create opportunities to develop at a lower price point? I will say as long as I've been in this business, and my background is in development for a long time. The development always comes in at the top of the price pyramid. I mean, that's just kind of the way the kind of the housing stock gets refreshed, and as the existing market tends to age into the more affordable price point.","This cycle, given how much high-rise construction has been, and given how expensive high-rise is to build, maybe that's a little bit more so than in past cycles. So some of it is location. There's people talking about in the future with autonomous vehicles and Uber and everything else, as there's a need for less parking, that will tend to bring costs down some, and we have looked at cases where, can we push the envelope a little bit on parking and maybe not build as much as we would have built 10 years ago. So that's a way, particularly if the parking is underground, where in a structure you can start to bring the costs down. And we're looking at pushing, whether it's modular or tall timber or other building technologies \u2013 we haven't tried anything really out of the box yet, but I think it's as an industry something that there's a lot of talk about.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Maybe just to add to that, Daniel. I think location of product is probably the biggest impactful thing that you can do. And if you look on \u2013 as Patrick said, now that we've broken out between high-rise, mid-rise and garden. If you take Columbus Circle out of it, the high-rise rents are kind of in the $3,000 to $3,500 range, mid-rise are roughly kind of in the $2,500 to $3,000 range, and the garden is more in the $2,000 and $2,500 range. And you look at the mid-rise and the garden piece, that's pretty close to what our same-store basket is running for today. I mean, the average rent, I think, is around $2,450. And so that's probably the most impactful thing that we can do. And then always looking to take advantage of new technologies, as Matt had mentioned as well.","Daniel Santos - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","That's helpful. Just one quick follow-up on the land. Just wanted to clarify, you guys said that strategy as we understand it, is to take the options on the land versus buying it and just clarifying that was not the case with this land that you took a impairment on?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Correct. We own the lands in that case. And as Matt had mentioned, we bought it back in the 2000s and it was an existing use, it's basically industrial, light R&D and it was in a part of Tysons Corner that was going to be going through a master plan change that would allow for an up zone to residential and ultimately we just decided that it didn't make as much economic sense as we had hoped when we made that back in the 2000s.","Daniel Santos - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Good afternoon. Sean, where are renewals achieved for April and where are they going out for May?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. For April, renewals achieved basically are still in the low 4's, consistent with Q1, which is at 4.2%. And then, in terms of what's going out for May and June, they're in the high 5's, that's up about 40 basis points from where we initially sent out offer letters for April.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","And then you typically see 100 basis points bleed, 100 basis points to 150 basis points between what you're sending out and what you're achieving?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Typically, yeah, it was a little wider. In the first quarter it was a little bit weaker, it was closer to 200 basis points, but that would be more average as you described, yes.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Great. Thank you. And then, Tim or Matt, on the development pipeline that you lay out and as far as for 2018, longer term, how does that fit in, how do we think about that with the East 96th Street deal, I know there's been increased media on it lately and I've seen it listed as potentially $1 billion development. What's the expected start time on that, and how does that fit in, in terms of the commentary of the development pipeline coming down and doing less high rise?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Conor, this is Matt. We have been making progress. There's still a lot of entitlement work in front of us as well as design work there. So, we think that's likely a 2019 start. And when I mentioned that, 25% of our $3.4 billion in development rights is high rise, that's the vast majority of it that one deal right there.","So, we do think, as we talked about a couple of quarters ago, that's a public-private partnership. The timing on that might actually be pretty good, when you think about kind of the macroeconomics, if we wind up starting that in 2019, delivering it in 2021 and 2022. And it really plays to our strengths. We still think that's a great deal, it's not $1 billion deal. There is a ground lease involved. So, there's an implied land value, I think our investment in that deal is roughly in the $600 million to $650 million range.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Jason Reilley, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin.","Jason Reilley","Thank you, Allen, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities' First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.","Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There's a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release, as well as in the company's Form 10-K and form 10-Q filed with the SEC.","As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton","Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q1 call. Joining me today are Tom Sargeant, Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. As all of you know, I'm sure at this point, this is Tom's last earnings call in his glorious career here at AvalonBay. Tom's been here for 28 years with Avalon and Trammell Crow Residential before that the last 19 as a CFO. And as you all know, Tom just has been a great steward and leader with really an unprecedented track record as a CFO in the REIT industries. So I think, I speak for everyone on both sides of this call and tell Tom we'll miss him and we wish him the best in his retirement.","So in terms of the format for the call, we're going to do it the same way as we did last quarter. We received a lot of favorable feedback from our format last quarter. And earlier this morning, we did post a management letter and a slide deck before the market opened. I'll be providing management commentary on the slides and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterward. My comments will focus on providing a high-level summary of the quarter's results, providing management's perspective on the economic in apartment cycle. I'll then focus a bit on redevelopment and corresponding impacts on portfolio performance. This scenario, we believe it's not that well understood by the markets, stuff that we've been talking about a little bit recently in private conversations with many of you. And then lastly, I'll touch on development performance and funding so far this cycle, an area that we think we'll increasingly differentiate our performance as the cycle matures.","So with that, let's get started. I'm going to turn to Slide 4 with a review of Q1 results. Q1 -- in Q1, we posted a solid OFFO growth of around 8% per share driven in part by healthy same-store revenue growth of 3.7%, which was up a bit from 3.5% reported last quarter. In addition, was helped by the completion of $100 million in new developments, which is stabilized at an initial yield of more than 7%. We also started 4 communities totaling $300 million in Q1 and raised a like amount of capital, approximately $300 million in a combination of variable rate debt and dispositions with an initial cost of capital of right around 2.5%.","Turning to Slide 5, we believe this cycle has room to run for both the economy and the apartment industry. Job growth is really only at the point now where the economy is just recovered the 8 million jobs it lost from the last downturn. And while cumulative job growth so far this cycle is similar to last cycle, it's only about 1\/4 of what we experienced in the 90s, when we had a longer economic cycle. And so from our standpoint, the labor market is up, plenty of capacity to support economic growth.","When you look at the apartment segment, just look at the rent growth, rent's are only about 5% nationally above prior peak, which occurred 6 years ago. And cumulative rent growth, this expansion, again, while 2\/3 of what we saw in the 2000s is only about 20% of what we've experienced in the 1990s.","Turning to Slide 6, we think the private sector should help sustain economic growth as well. Profits are still increasing, so that retained earnings are providing capital and liquidity to help sustain additional economic growth. And generally, economic expansions have continued 2 to 4 years after profits have actually reached their peak during the cycle. As companies eventually put profits and cash to work that they earned early in the cycle.","Turning to Slide 7, we think the apartment markets and trends in the apartment markets are actually consistent with the cycle that is in the mid-innings. When you look at both rents and replacement costs, they're largely on trend, at least a trend experienced over the last 15 or 16 years. Such that we believe the current activity and investment levels are not reflective, currently, of an overheated market that would normally lead to a correction, but are actually at quite normalized levels. And in our view, supports a thesis that -- of apartment markets that are largely in equilibrium, but at a very healthy level.","This is a further reinforced when you look at the supply\/demand fundamentals going forward, just turning to Slide 8. Over the next 3 years, we expect job growth -- are on the right-hand side of this chart, to be largely in line with deliveries. And the supply projection actually doesn't net out units taken out of service or lost to obsolescence. It also includes, by the way, this is our markets. It also includes the imbalances we know that are -- that exist in D.C. And it ignores or doesn't take into account just the unusually low level of single-family supply that we're experiencing today. Similarly, on the demand side, we're just looking at jobs here, we're not considering the pent-up demand from significant household consolidation that we saw during the correction or the higher share of multifamily households that are supported by demographics. So when you just look at jobs versus new supply, it's looks it's about equilibrium, but I think, there's a reason to believe that's even better than that when you drill down underneath those 2 things. And then as you look versus the last 3 year, certainly not as favorable, but the last 3 years benefited from an unusually low level of supply, when supply needed to be low, as excess inventory was being burned off in the housing sector. And we're now at a point where we believe excess inventory has been absorbed throughout the housing sector. We're basically at a period where markets are in balance today.","So turning to Slide 9 and how does this impact our portfolio. We look at the same unit rent growth after a weak December and January, which saw weak job numbers as well. We started to see March and April rebound back to levels that were similar to what we experienced in 2013. Importantly, we continued to gain momentum throughout the quarter and into April. So overall, not too different than what we experienced a year ago in the same-store portfolio.","Turning to Slide 10, I'd like to shift now and talk a little bit about redevelopment and how it can impact portfolio performance. As you know, AvalonBay does not include redevelopment in the same-store bucket for reporting purposes. We separate out redevelopment in its own bucket, as we believe it's a meaningful line of business, where we've been investing a fair bit of capital over the last few years. But we do recognize that most of the industry, if not all, do include redevelopment for the purposes of reporting. And so for the purpose of comparison, we thought it would be helpful to take a look at what would happen if we included redevelopment in our same-store bucket from a reporting standpoint. And as you could see, it would add about 30 to 60 basis points over the last 3 years, 2011 to '13 to same-store revenue growth if it were included and about 20 basis points in the first quarter of this year.","Turning to Slide 11, same-store revenue then would have increased by about 40 basis points from 5.1% to 5.5% over the last 3 years if redevelopment were included in the same-store bucket. And the same-store NOI would have increased about 60 basis points or about 100 basis points above the sector. And when you look at and compare it to the sector, turning to Slide 12, at 7.5% NOI growth over those 3 years, that would have placed AvalonBay towards the top of the sector or at the top of the sector. We get about 100 basis points above the sector average over the last 3 years. Now we're just providing this analysis for cross comparability purposes. Obviously, it is dependent upon the level of redevelopment by -- being undertaken by us, as well as the comps, so it's hard to know how comparable it is. But frankly the same is true, when if we exclude redevelopment from our same-store bucket and others are including it, it equally makes that a tough to compare performance by looking at same-store metrics alone and it's something we've been talking about with many of you over the last couple of quarters. It's not our intention to change our reporting. We think it, as I've mentioned before, we do think it's meaningful to separate out redevelopment to give visibility into the same-store portfolio performance and overall portfolio performance. But we will provide the information in a footnote for cross comparability purposes as we did this quarter.","Now I'll touch -- moving to Slide 13, I want to touch on development and funding activities so far this cycle. So far, we've started about $4.5 billion in new developments, about $1.4 billion that's been completed to date at an initial stabilized yield of 7.4%. And we have another $1 billion in lease-up that is currently projected to yield around 7.3%. So about $2.5 billion, or a little more than 1\/2 of what has been started so far this cycle earning yields that are projected to be in the mid-7% range. Against funding of about $5 billion or almost $5 billion so far this cycle that has been raised at an average initial cost of 4.3% or spreads of about 300 basis points of development so far and it's been -- where we have lease-up visibility on, at least leasing visibility on relative to the cost of capital that we've raised so far this cycle. At current spreads, $1 billion in annual completions we'd about 300 to 400 basis points to annual FFO growth. Which by the way is consistent with and explains much of our outperformance over the long term versus the sector. From an NAV perspective, $4.5 billion started so far this cycle is projected to translate into total asset value north of $6 billion or roughly the value of BRE upon the sale of Essex, which represents just 4 years worth of starts. Obviously, this growth platform's a powerful growth engine, both in terms of company scale, as well as earnings and NAV growth.","Turning to Slide 14, it's certainly the case this year, as we're projected to deliver over 5,000 apartments throughout the course of the year. This will help fuel earnings growth for the balance of the year. In fact in the second half of the year, lease-up community NOI, net of incremental capital costs, will contribute about as much growth to FFO as the stabilized portfolio compared to the first half the year. So development's contributing meaningfully to -- our lease-up communities are contributing meaningfully to FFO growth in 2014, particularly, based upon the kind of spreads that I was talking about earlier.","Shifting to Slide 15, we continue to match-fund this pipeline. In fact about 80% of all development and redevelopment underway is already capitalized with permanent capital, leaving only about $600 million left to be funded. And when you look at -- turning to Slide 16, in addition to locking in attractive investment spreads, match funding results in improved credit metrics as development stabilizes, even if 100% of unfunded commitments is financed with debt. The $3 billion pipeline currently underway, about $2 billion of which is incurred, is generating very little current cash flow, but is projected to deliver ultimately about $220 million in incremental EBITDA versus an incremental capital need of about $600 million. So even if that $600 million was funded entirely with debt, on an incremental basis, you're talking about debt-to-EBITDA of only about 3x, which would -- which actually would enhance overall metrics bringing down debt-to-EBITDA from 5.7x to a projected level of 5.3x, which is based upon hypothetical case, where you know it's in essence you would use to spend new starts, but complete the existing pipeline with 100% debt. But I think this gives a bit of an insight into some of the additional benefits of match funding the pipeline as we go along, in addition, to locking in attractive spreads.","So in summary, we're off to a good start in 2014. Healthy apartment fundamentals continue and we believe markets are poised to enter a prolonged period of equilibrium similar to what we experienced in the 1990s. Operating performance remains strong and we believe has been near or top of the sector so far the cycle. The development platform is providing a meaningful source of earnings and NAV accretion that will further differentiate our performance as the cycle matures. And is being supported by a strong balance sheet with a very conservative funding strategy that insulates us from capital market volatility and locks in attractive investment spreads.","So with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions, and we're ready to hear questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll first go to David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Tom, first of all, thank you for the pleasure of working with you all these years. We'll miss you and we wish you well.","Thomas J. Sargeant","Thank you, David.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","And I guess my first question, I've got a couple of detail questions. The first one has to do with the notation that you're looking at moving a little bit more towards suburban markets in some of your development strategies. And I guess, I wonder, number one, is there -- do you think there'll be a materially impact to the portfolio metrics in terms of rent growth and aggregate price points? And number two on that is, doesn't that kind of buck the trend of an increased urbanization among younger demographics today?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, maybe I'll start with the second part, and Matt, maybe, if you fill out in terms of the impact and how it's impacting our portfolio metrics? In terms of bucking the trends, David, from a demand standpoint, we agree that there continues to be some urbanization, we don't think it's -- we don't think people exclusively want to live downtown. There's still demand in the suburbs. I think, you're even starting to see employment and office space start to absorb reasonably well in some of the suburban markets. But what's undeniable is supply has shifted in response to that demand. And if you look just within our market footprint, projected supply over the next couple of years is significantly outweighs what we're seeing and what we expect to see in the suburbs in the urban submarkets. And so we think there's some urban submarkets that will continue to outperform, but we think there are many suburban submarkets that will outperform just based upon what's happening at the margin from a demand and supply standpoint. And the other thing, I'd say is, just where we've seeing better values has been in the suburbs over the last -- probably over the last 12 to 18 months from a Development Rights perspective, as capital has really been chasing, in some cases, exclusively urban opportunities. And so part of it's been opportunistic on our end and part of it's been, frankly, an intentional effort to be a bit diversified in terms of how we are penetrating our markets. But, Matt, maybe you can just talk a little bit about how it's impacting the overall portfolio composition?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","Yes, I don't think -- it's a pretty big portfolio. So I think -- it actually takes a lot to move the needle one way or the other on that question. And we don't -- it is -- as Tim said, it is much more bottom-up than top-down, it really starts with local teams on the ground in each of our regions, identifying the best risk-adjusted return opportunities for them to invest the capital in new development opportunities. If you look at what we currently have under construction, it's probably a little -- currently under construction today, it's actually, probably, a little bit more heavily urban in the portfolio as a whole. The Development Rights are more suburban than the current construction. So as that pulls through, it -- they tend to kind of wash each other out, so you'll see us get perhaps a little bit more urban concentration over the next year or so, as very large urban deals like 55 Ninth in San Francisco or West Chelsea and AVA High Line and Willoughby AVA Dobro [ph] in New York and Brooklyn get completed. But it is true certainly that the starts we anticipate, you've seen this quarter and in the next year or so, we'll probably swing that pendulum back a little bit. So if you look out 3 or 4 years, it will probably be very similar to what we are today in terms of the overall balance.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And I just want to have one follow-up question on that topic. When you think about the nature of the suburban assets over time, slightly higher CapEx requirements, lower barriers to entry, more increase -- sort of more likely increases in competition. Do you view those assets as less defensible over time? And potentially, do you measure those assets with potentially a shorter holding period from an investment criteria perspective?","Timothy J. Naughton","David, I'll start it and, Matt, jump in. First of all, I'll address your comment about lower barriers to entry, which is in our markets absolutely is untrue. It's actually the opposite. Our suburban submarkets are much tougher to build in than our urban submarkets. It's usually the constraint in the urban submarkets tend to be bad of economics. There's no shortage of opportunity, even in places like New York and Boston, which I think, historically, people have considered to be tough to penetrate, it's been largely because the economics just haven't made sense. When you go to the suburbs, particularly, where you look at our portfolio, it tends be pretty infill more employment center and not bedroom community type locations, often transit oriented, those are very difficult places to get entitlements, often taking 3, 4, 5 years. And it's an expensive way to play and honestly the nimbyism is much more rampant in those kind of locations. So that's part of what we like about the suburbs at least in our markets. It may be different, as you look at other -- other parts of the country. But I don't know, Sean, maybe you want to address the issue, just CapEx in some of our suburban versus urban, which I think may be a little different than what your assumption might be, David, on that.","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, David, this is Sean. I think, one thing to keep in mind, just from a CapEx perspective and I'll make one another comment. But from a CapEx perspective, the high-rise assets, you do have other components that you don't have in suburban assets that do drive up CapEx, so you've got an interior corridor that's typically heated and cooled, you've got paint and carpet in the hallways, you've got typically more expensive mechanical systems, things of that sort you've got to deal with. So we take that all into account in terms of the underwriting of new development opportunities, but the generic statement that the newer suburban assets are more CapEx intensive than a new urban assets isn't necessarily true. And one of your initial questions was just about suburban assets and maybe slower rent growth, and things of that sort. I think one thing just to keep in mind for us is in some of the suburban locations like take Central or Northern New Jersey, you may see slower rent growth, but to the extent that the development yields going in are substantially higher, 7%-plus as an example, the total return on that opportunity will be quite attractive, even though the ongoing rent growth that you might publish in same-store is lower, and that's okay.","Operator","Next we'll go to Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Just Tim, as I think about the $600 million of -- that's left to fund, you talked in your letter about $230 million of wholly-owned assets and then, obviously, Christie Place, which I think, they generate the company, well over $100 million of cash from your promote. That takes care of well over half of that funding. How should we think about the remaining? Should we just assume it's debt funded? Or is there any desire to issue any equity?","Timothy J. Naughton","Okay, I'll let Kevin jump in. The only thing I'd say, Michael, we are taking on, we do expect to take on new commitments as the year continues, as we continue to start the balance of the $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion that was in our initial guidance. So we'll continue to have additional commitments that we'll need to continue to be funded. But, Kevin, you might just talk a little bit about overall funding strategy.","Kevin P. O'Shea","Sure. Well, Michael, as you'll recall from our first quarter call, what we announced was an expectation to source about $1.5 billion of external capital throughout 2014. As you pointed out, we've raised some capital in the first quarter, we raised about $300 million overall, when you take into account the unsecured term loan and the asset that was sold in Connecticut. As we -- and we've got some assets that are under contract for sale in the second quarter here. So as we step forward here and take on new commitments, with respect to development, we're applying to continue to match fund as we go along with long-term capital. Currently, our most attractive sources of external capital continue to be unsecured debt and asset sales. And so we would expect as we step through the year and make new commitments and more or less, ratably source capital that we continue to primarily source that capital from asset sales and unsecured debt.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, this is Nick. Just wanted to touch on the Archstone portfolio rolling into the same store. So it looks like the occupancy for Archstone right now is about 50 bps below the overall portfolio. So what are you underwriting in terms of occupancy gains for Archstone for the remainder of this year?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Nick, this is Sean. Let me give you a little bit of insight into that. First, just to set the table in terms of where we're trending right now to give you some perspective. The Archstone bucket is trending around 95.6% in terms of economic occupancy, just sort of where we are for April versus last year it was around 95.2%. But when you blend that with the AvalonBay bucket, the AvalonBay bucket has come down in occupancy last year at this time, we were pushing occupancy up in the mid-96 range that's trending at 95.9% right now. So if you blend the 2 buckets together, they're trending around 95.8% economic versus last year being around 96.2%. And we talked about -- this is a little bit, I think, on our second, third quarter call last year that occupancy actually drifted up in the second quarter beyond where we had targeted, and so we were pushing rents a little bit harder as we got into the third quarter. So we're going to have that burden from a comp prospective on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter giving back that occupancy. But our expectation right now in terms of the Archstone bucket is that trending at 95.6% to 95.8% economic for the balance of the year would be a reasonable range in terms of our expectation overall.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And just one other quick question on concessions. And I recognize it's not a large number overall, but it seems like the year-over-year growth rate increased considerably. So could you talk about where you're offering concessions and kind of the plan overall with them?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure. I think concessions were not used a lot, but it does vary from market to market as you pointed out. Generally speaking, we run on an effective rent pricing basis, that's our strategy, which has worked very consistently. I think most of REITs are that way, but there are select markets, where the idea of a \"special\" is in vogue and that's a market like Seattle as an example. The other place where we look to consider using concessions is in some of the rent regulated markets and submarkets, where you'd like to have the sort of the face rent on the lease be higher and if you give a concession, that's okay. You typically see that in New York and some places in San Francisco as an example. And a little bit, as the Archstone bucket bleeds in, you'll see a little bit of that in the D.C. area with couple of rent-controlled assets as well. So I'd say, it's more of the rent regulated stuff, where you see concessions, but there are certain markets at certain times a year like Seattle in Q4 or Q1. We might see an elevated level of concession just given the nature of that particular submarket.","Operator","And now we'll go to Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Appreciate all this talk about the development yields and the management letter. And what I'm wondering is, when you talk about the rents now being higher, it looks like, we calculate the rents are about 10% higher for the 12 communities where you raised rents, and despite those assets now being 80 basis points above expectations on yield. What I'm wondering is, how do we think about the other $2 billion that's in the pipeline, as far as how the sort of current yield on that versus how that could possibly get above 7%, since you're listing 6.5%, I think, is the overall yield in the development page?","Timothy J. Naughton","Nick, Tim here. Just one thing to point out. So, of the $3 billion that's under construction, we mentioned about $1 billion that's in lease-up, that's yielding about 7.3%, the entire bucket is yielding about -- is projected to yield about 6.5%. So 2\/3 that we haven't marked yet to market. Some of it is at market as we just started this quarter. But the thing I'd point out is, of that $2 billion, about $1.2 billion is actually California and New York City, so very low sort of cap rate type markets and certainly from a value creation perspective, we actually don't see that basket of assets being materially different than that's in lease-up or what we already completed. But the other thing to put in perspective, the $1 billion that's in lease-up, that's increased by about 10%. If you just looked at it from a market standpoint in the submarkets area, I think, the rent growth, since the time that we started on a weighted average basis, has been about 5%. So we've outperformed kind of our expectations, if you will, as adjusted for rent inflation by about 5% so far that lease-up. But one way to think about it is what is your projection for market inflation over the next 12 to 24 months as we build out that bucket of assets.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, one of the assets that was in, where the rents didn't go up was West Chelsea. Could you just talk a little bit about how leasing is going there? And whether that's just hasn't reached a high enough leased rate, whereby there -- you would be raising the rent on that asset?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","Yes, this is Matt. That is one that we will probably be able to mark-to-market in next quarter's release. It's a little bit of a unique animal in that. It is about 20%, 25% leased. But there's really 2 pieces, there's the AVA piece, and the Avalon piece. And the -- we have not started leasing the Avalon piece yet. And so we didn't feel comfortable, kind of, putting a number on where rents are today there given that the Avalon piece -- those are the higher rent apartments, so it's a very significant part of the rent roll and frankly the affordables are more heavily concentrated in the AVA piece. And so that also affects kind of what's leased to date. So I guess, the short answer is, presumably next quarter, we'll be able to mark that to market and see where those rents are. And I don't know, Sean, if you have anything to add?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, just on the velocity question that you had. We leased at a pace of 36 a month in the first quarter for the AVA component of that property, which is open. The West Chelsea, Avalon component is not yet opened and leasing. So just that's the AVA High Line component at that velocity.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, just lastly, I mean, can you just talk a little bit about how the competition is over there with, whether it's Gotham West or some of the other assets, as far as how those buildings are filling up and whether you are being forced to think about offering more concessions?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure. The -- we haven't seen a huge impact on AVA High Line from those assets, but there's 2, or 3 assets that have been in lease-up that have had some impact on the Midtown West and Clinton deals that we own. And the Gotham deal is probably the least furthest along, I think, it's around 50% leased right now. Mercedes House, which is a [indiscernible] deal is about to leased up. And there is one other asset that's about to leased up. So it has some impact on some of the existing assets, but we'd have not had much overlap with AVA High Line in terms of specific competition from the deals you referenced.","Operator","We now go to Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Just staying on New York for one second. In terms of the better than expected results that you cited in your management letter. Was that largely driven by Long Island City getting better from what it had been, I guess, in the third into the fourth quarter?","Sean J. Breslin","Ryan, this is Sean. In terms of New York City, Long Island City is underperforming our portfolio average. Where we're getting the best growth out of New York right now in terms of the city product is what's happening basically at Morningside Heights. We're pushing mid-6s. One of the Bowery deals is pushing mid-5s as opposed to Long Island City has been underperforming, and the other place where we're again pretty good growth is out of Brooklyn, [indiscernible] we're pushing mid-5s as compared to the Riverview assets on a blended basis are more like 3, 3.5 on a year-over-year basis for revenue growth.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. And then just one more question on Boston. Just curious if could you provide some incremental color there in terms of starting to see that market come back. Now that the weather conditions have improved and whether or not -- are there any specific trends between your urban and suburban assets in that market?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure. This is Sean again. So in terms of Boston, yes, it was a tough winter. We did see turnover move up in Boston as compared to the first quarter of '13. It was up about 5%, which is roughly about a 13% increase in move-outs. If you were still buying homes, it was one of the few markets. If you looked at the home sales data yesterday, it is actually up on a year-over-year basis as compared to many other markets that are down. Still little bit of pressure from that. And certainly the weather wasn't helpful from a traffic perspective. In terms of the different submarkets that you mentioned, the closer-in locations actually did relatively well in the first quarter. So the Metro Boston stuff like Newton Highlands, Chestnut Hill, all did pretty well producing total rents or revenue growth between call it 6%, 7% range, 95, 93 North was putting out good numbers, north of 4. MetroWest was relatively weak though and I think that's some of the more distant assets where we did see some home buying pressure. And in the South Shore, it was doing okay, it was in the 3% to 4% range. So I say that more infill markets were doing generally well, as well as 95, 93 North, but the more distant suburban stuff was a little bit weaker.","Operator","Now we'll take a question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Yes, Tom, we'll miss you. So best in your next phase. Just a few questions here. In your -- in the letter, this morning, you said that ex the winter costs, your same-store expenses were up 3.9, and your guidance for the year is 2 to 3. So can you just walk us through what some of the areas where you expect to save on expenses to get the expense within the -- within your full-year guidance range?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Alex, this is Sean. So you did quote the correct number. If you excluded the excess utility and snow removal costs, Opex year-over-year would have been 3.9, and NOI growth would have been 3.7 as opposed to the 2.6 that was reported. In terms of the outlook for the year, in terms of what we're seeing, basically, if we just trended pretty close to what our budget was, we'd be at the high end of the guidance range that we provided. We are seeing a little bit of relief in a few areas like property taxes, as an example, that may come in a little bit below budget based on our forecast. So based on what I'd say right now is we still expect the first half of the year expenses to be elevated for a number of different reasons, and we mentioned that when we provided the outlook. But based on where we see the second half coming in with budget and a few adjustments based on things we know right now, we still expect to be within the guidance we provided for OpEx, but certainly trending towards the high end of the range.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, and then the second question is, on Slide 9 where you showed the ramp-up -- your expected ramp up for rents this year versus the last year where it's flat in the first and then stepped up in the second. Given the economy is basically the same this year as last year, why are you expecting a different ramp up in rents versus last year?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, Alex, it's Tim. I think you may be misreading the chart. This is actually monthly, not quarterly data, just to be clear. So these are actuals. So it's -- the fourth bar there is actually April through -- I think, the footnote says sort of like April 22. So it's not the full month yet. But these are blended rents. So it's a mix of new move-ins and renewals that we know today or that we have experienced, January through March. So it's not far off of what we expected, to be honest, but this is actuals, it's not projections.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, then, sorry about misreading that. Then if I can just ask sort of replacement question then. In Seattle, your occupancy slipped a little, but you guys pushed rent a lot. Was that just a concerted effort to focus more on rent? Or was there some unexpected tenants leaving because they didn't want to pay or something like that?","Sean J. Breslin","No, not necessarily one specific strategy. I mean, we basically, as you know, Alex, use LRO to try to optimize for both rent and occupancy. They are certain markets where you forecast things might happen -- or submarkets, I am sorry, submarkets, I was referring to and they don't come to us. For example, we had an impact on Redmond in the fourth quarter that bled through to the first quarter for us, where some of the corporate activity just changed, as compared to the seasonal history, mainly due to Microsoft, so that had some impact that we had not anticipated. So the things like that, but nothing intentional that we were trying to push it one direction or another. You generally, to be honest, try to protect occupancy a little bit more in Seattle in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","In your management letter, you say that starts in D.C. or starting to taper off. But the permit trends show that they continue to increase. So can you talk us through the disconnects that might be developing between starts and permits in D.C, if that is the case?","Timothy J. Naughton","Dave, its Tim. I don't know that we can, to be honest, so we've been -- obviously we've been tracking starts in projected delivery. It's not unusual where they might -- particularly in the market where people have been spending a lot of capital to get their deals permit ready. It's not uncommon where it might pull the permit, and in our case we pulled the permit at AVA 55 M [ph] in part to lock in a tax abatement, several million dollars of value. We may or may not start that over the next 12 months. So, I think, there's probably some cases like that, but I can tell you what -- I don't have a theory for you as to why maybe the permit and the start data might be diverging.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay, do you expect D.C. starts to be lower in '14 than '13?","Timothy J. Naughton","That's our projection. Yes.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then as it relates to the weather the disclosure on expenses was quite helpful, but can you explain what the impact could be on the revenue side? It looks like you're trending a little bit below plan in the Northeast in New York and with some occupancy to make up in the Northeast. So, over the course of the year, how impactful will the weather from the first quarter be on revenue growth?","Sean J. Breslin","Dave, this is Sean, I'm not sure I could answer your question precisely. We still expect to be within the guidance range that we provided. The only comment I could say really is that as you pointed out, New England started off a bit slower as than we anticipated in terms of not only the typical occupancy gains. But as a result of that, the rent growth that we were able to push through in that region in the first quarter. That being said, it has picked up traction in the last 3 or 4 weeks as the weather turned. I'll give you a couple of statistics just availability has come down about 50 basis points over the last 3 weeks. Occupancy has trended up. So we're seeing some movement there. So it's hard to quantify exactly what the difference might be, and the impact on revenue. But on the other side of the coin Northern California is outperforming. So I'm not prepared to give you a precise answer other than we expect to be within the range we provided in terms of revenue growth for the year.","Timothy J. Naughton","And, Dave, its Tim. Just to follow up, we are basically on plan in Q1, as Sean said, in some of the areas that we missed, we had some offsets, particularly in place like -- particularly in Northern California. It's ultimately going to turn on that one chart that you saw, I think, that showed a bit of a ramp up in terms of same unit rent. Rents that we're seeing and whether or not that holds we're running around 4% in April for -- that's for the AvalonBay legacy portfolio. At this point, but to the extent it holds in that range throughout the year, obviously that's pretty good, relative to the outlook that we gave.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. And the last question relates to -- for the same-store pool, what were your renewal and new move in gains in 1Q?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure, Dave, it's Sean. I can provide you that. So for the same-store bucket in the first quarter as we quoted the blend was 2.7%, it was basically 5% on renewals and essentially flat on move ins and where we had downward pressure in New England, a little bit in New York and considering the mid-Atlantic, but was offset by gains in Pacific Northwest, Northern California and Southern California.","Operator","Now we'll go to Derek Bower with ISI Group.","Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can you just provide more clarity on the assumptions driving your 2Q guidance? Specifically what is expected a level of dispositions for the quarter? And what are the $0.02 of non-routine items attributed to?","Kevin P. O'Shea","Sure, Derek, this is Kevin. In terms of sort of a roadmap from an OFFO perspective from 1Q to the second quarter and then touching on some of the adjustments. We had $1.63 in OFFO for the first quarter and our outlook for the second quarter in terms of OFFO is $1.66. So essentially kind of a roadmap from the first quarter to the second quarter. There's probably about $0.05 pickup in community NOI of which about $0.03 relates to the same-store NOI combined basket. And then about $0.02 from development NOI. And probably with an offset of about $0.02 in terms of interest expense and overhead combined to create $0.02 drag on that to get to a net change of $0.03 from -- in terms of OFFO sequential change. In terms of the $0.02 for next quarter, it's largely prepayment penalties, and continuing loss on the parking lot joint venture that we have, combine to produced the $0.02 in OFFO adjustments for the second quarter. And the prepayment penalties relate to some fund dispositions that are scheduled to take place in the second quarter.","Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So the $230 million that's currently under contract that would be a 2Q event, correct?","Kevin P. O'Shea","The $230 million that was under contract would be a 2Q event. That was fully on communities. There were some additional fund dispositions that are scheduled for the quarter that are in addition to that amount, and actually a couple of them have some prepayment penalties associated with them that would have a flow-through effect on our financials.","Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and any promote from a JV disposition is not included in the guidance, right?","Kevin P. O'Shea","That is correct.","Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just touching on the Bay Area and obviously there was some strength there. Can you talk about how much of a contribution the increase in non-same-store pull was, and would you say the better growth has been driven by you fixing some of the turnover issues you had, late last year, or is it just the market overall is performing better than expected?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Derek, this is Sean in terms of general commentary about Northern California, I'd offer few things. First, as you could tell from what we reported. The East Bay remains particularly strong. And the contribution from our ease [ph] communities there is very strong. So East Bay generally speaking strong, lower price point communities probably stronger, and we have a fairly good allocation of lower price point communities in the East Bay. San Jose has held pretty steady, and actually I'd say as we look through the year, San Jose may surprise to the upside just because the impact from supply that we're seeing there is not as much maybe as we expected I am hearing similar comments from our peers, in terms of the supplies there seems to be absorbed without an issue. Rents are starting to get pushed a little bit harder so San Jose feels good. And then San Francisco portfolio is performing well. Certainly, we have sort of the flagship asset at Mission Bay. But our -- frankly our lower price point assets in communities at Sunset Towers, Diamond Heights, Daly City, Pacifica et cetera are doing quite well. Some of those lower price point communities are putting up 9s and 10s, as an example, in terms of year-over-year growth. So I say the price point communities in San Francisco and the East Bay are doing particularly well, and San Jose seems to be on, I'd say, a positive momentum trend as we look through the rest of the year.","Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just in D.C. where are your new rents today and what are renewals looking like for June and July?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure, D.C. specifically just to give you some sense, so in the first quarter renewals were up about 3% and move-ins were down somewhere around 4%. Looking out to May and June in terms of the renewal offers, they're out sort of in the low- to mid-4s, they'll probably settle in the 3 to 3.5 range would be my expectation based on what I know today. To give you some sense, for example, April is trending the 3.9%, 4% range for the mid-Atlantic portfolio.","Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And are new leases today worse than 4% or are they in line?","Sean J. Breslin","In line. April is actually trending a little bit better, it's trending at around 3%.","Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So for the whole quarter it was negative 4 and April it was negative 3?","Sean J. Breslin","Correct. April to date. Correct.","Operator","Now we will take a question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just, I know, we spent a lot of time talking about the OpEx impact from the weather. Just curious if you could comment on the impact on just construction activity, in general, in those weather-impacted markets, and whether or not that may have helped or hurt leasing activity given the potential delays in construction that kind of thing?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","Sure, Vincent, this is Matt. I can try and answer that one. As relates to leasing activity, surprisingly, it's been pretty strong in our new lease-ups in the Northeast. We averaged 21, 22 leases a month. 22 leases a month across all of our lease-ups. But the Northeast lease-ups and certainly the mid-Atlantic lease-ups were at or above our initial projections. So we -- people were anxious to lease our brand new apartment homes in these markets even through the winter. As it relates to construction, I have not heard of any material delays at this point, due to the weather. I mean, there is a certain amount of weather days built into the schedule. In general, we have more weather days, certainly we did in the first quarter in the Northeast. But generally speaking, these are mostly jobs that take on average 2 years to build, and if you are on a 4 or 5 more weather days in January or February, they will find a way to make that up.","Operator","And now, we'll take a question from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you about condo conversions sounded like there might have been a trade of a rental building to condo converter in New York recently. I just wanted to get an update on what you're hearing there in New York and in other markets, and are any of your asset sales to a condo bid?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Karin, it's Sean. I'll answer your second question first. At this point, no, none of the dispositions that we either have under contract or are contemplating, we're expecting to go to a condo converter that certainly change, but that's not the expectation right at the moment. I've heard some chatter about the one deal that did convert in New York, I don't know the details, to be honest, can't tell you anything about it. There has been some chatter about condo conversions in New York and in San Francisco given the level of inventory that's currently available for sale in those markets, but I've not been close to any specific transactions to be able to give you much insight into that trend.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then just second question is do you still expect Archstone to be neutral to the same-store growth expectations for the balance of the year after it rolls in?","Sean M. Clark","Neutral to the same-store growth expectations? We don't expect to provide -- we're not doing anything different in terms of providing different guidance than we already provided as it relates to the revenue growth from the portfolio. And we provided that in the Q1 information, so nothing has changed from our initial guidance.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Is it roughly -- is the same-store growth guidance roughly the same for the 2 different portfolios, though?","Sean M. Clark","We provided initial guidance that was -- the midpoint was 3.625 overall for the AvalonBay portfolio.","Timothy J. Naughton","And we provided the Q2 to Q4 guidance.","Sean M. Clark","Q2 to Q4 for the combined, yes, I don't have that outlook right in front of me. But nothing's changed from what we've provided in terms of guidance at this point.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] .","Next we will go to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","George Hoglund - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is George Hugland on for Tayo. Just a couple of questions on the Boston market. First one, on the Assembly Road project, can you just give an update there? It looks like it was pushed back a quarter. And also just curious on how our rents are trending there?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","Yes, this is Matt, George. We did actually get our first [indiscernible] at Assembly Road, earlier this week or late last week. So that was one we definitely did suffer some delays. Some of it may have been weather-related, but, I think, a lot of it was related to -- just it's very complex mixed-use construction. It's a joint venture or partnership with Federal Realty. So we have actually a backlog of leasing activity, folks that have been waiting to move-in for us to get those [indiscernible]. We should be off to the races now on the lease-up, but we're only about 10% leased there, so again, we don't really mark the rents to market until we can get up to about 20%. And particularly in a situation like that where people haven't even been able -- the 10% they leased, they haven't actually walked the apartments. It's all been off of plans. So again, I would anticipate by the next quarter's release, we'll have more on that.","George Hoglund - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then also can you just comment on how new rental rates are trending in Downtown Boston?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure, George, this is Sean. I don't know if I have those specific communities with me to be able to quote you that. But I can give you the region overall if that helps. I can tell you that Downtown Boston, right now, is actually holding up a little bit better than we anticipated, in terms of expected rent change. I mentioned earlier in my comments, that the infill markets, Mid Highlands, as an example, Chestnut Hill, a couple of phases of the Bruce Center have actually been doing pretty well. Keep in mind, our sample in the core of Boston if you really looking urban high-rise, is essentially the Prudential Center. Sorry, I don't have the [indiscernible] numbers right in front of me, but we can get back to you on that, if you'd like, that information.","George Hoglund - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, that would be great. And also just on the Stuart Street construction project. How big of an impact was there? There was, I guess, a partial collapse at that structure?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","Yes, George, this is Matt again. Obviously a very unfortunate incident there where some steel was apparently perhaps overloaded on an upper floor and fell through temporary decking that had been put in place. The way these buildings gets built its a concrete core, that goes up first, and then you basically you put the lightweight steel up. And that's up multiple stories above where the concrete permanent floor is. So, the temporary decking got collapsed and lost on about 5 or 6 stories there at that structure. But there's a recovery plan in place, and there is -- the team has worked very well with the city of Boston and all the inspectors involved. So they are now well into the recovery plan, and we do not expect any material impact there on the economics of that deal.","Operator","Now we'll go to Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Tom, we're definitely going to miss you. And, Kevin, you've got big shoes to fill here. Tim, first question you talked previously about '14 being the peak in deliveries given what we're seeing in permitting, I know, you talked about D.C., but is that still the expectation in '14 is the peak, and then you see a drop down or do you expect '15 to be comparable at this point, from what you're seeing?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, Mike in our markets, it is. I can't speak for the U.S. overall, but in our markets, we are expecting still deliveries to peak. Just under 2% of inventory in 2014 and to come down both in '15 and '16 from those levels based upon starts that have already occurred and starts that we're projecting here over the next 6 to 9 months.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Second of all, in your presentation, you provided an interesting chart on replacement costs there. Can you talk about the growth you've seen in replacement costs year-over-year? And then, as you go forward, given the activity, we've seen in some of the other sectors picking up on the construction side. Is it your expectation that rents can keep pace with the growth in replacement costs over the next couple of years?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well it's interesting, I mean, if you look at these 2 charts side by side, they're important to consider together, right, it's the relationship between rents and replacement costs that ultimately drive whether there ought to be new supply. Both of these actually indexed about 3% inflation over 15-year period. So again sort of supports the notion that you're roughly at equilibrium. But we're at levels where the economics do still support new supply. We are still pursuing new deals as are many of our peers not as many made sense as they did in 2009 and '10 and '11, that is just the nature of cycles. But we are still seeing plenty of stuff that we think underwrites and makes sense in terms of the basis we've been at, as well as the projected economics. I think this -- I think the chart on the right captures our experience of the replacement costs pretty well. If you just look back at our total cost per unit, we just went over the $300,000 per unit mark really for the first time since like 2007, recently. With a more concentrated portfolio in the urban markets, and so, I think, this is pretty accurate. This is an index that we -- is a proprietary that we put together based upon both construction costs and land cost trends, but it actually matches our intuition and our own experience. So we feel pretty good about the -- about what it's telling us. It sort of matches -- it matches our experience at least at the moment. So I don't know if that answers your question, but there have been some markets where construction costs, particularly on the West Coast have still moved up 8% to 10% over the last year. But on the East Coast it's been much more -- we see much more normalized levels in the 3%, 4%, 5% range on a year-over-year basis.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just in light of that last comment, is there any markets then today where that equilibrium has gotten out of whack to where it doesn't make sense to be putting new construction today? Or where you think there is a significant catch up potential?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, well certainly parts of D.C. don't make sense, but you still might be surprised, which -- how many do still make sense if you just look at where assets are continuing to trade in this market. But there's still some that are just -- one, it's current -- in some cases, it's current economics but in more cases it's about where we think the market might be going over the next year or 2. So plenty of submarkets in D.C. that we wouldn't consider at this point, in the cycle. There are -- when you look at some of the urban costs and construction costs in the Northeast, that's giving challenging. I would say to -- you take the deal like National Street, it makes sense in part because of our are our land basis, is actually very, very attractive relative to what you could secure land today at. So there's some for sure that where the risk-adjusted economics don't make sense based upon where the assets might trade.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just a final question then in terms of same-store composition change going into second quarter, obviously with Archstone quite a bit of Southern California, as well as D.C. Just can you give us a sense of what D.C. and Los Angeles increased to as a percentage of the overall same-store bucket versus currently?","Sean M. Clark","Yes, Matt's looking it up here, Mike, this is Sean. My recollection is that the D.C. portfolio becomes about 16%, 17% on a combined basis. Give us just a second we can take a peek at it for you. We'll send you a note with that, Mike, with precise numbers.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a question on the suburban focus on development. Are you thinking more -- should we be thinking more in terms of your traditional Avalon-type garden style community or are you thinking more of a high-rise footprint in transit hubs, such as may be a rest [ph] in town center versus the Center City?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, Paula, that's a great question. Actually it's been -- if you look at just our Development Right pipeline versus currently under construction, the amount of garden is about the same. But really the shift has been from high rise to what we think of as mid-rise, which is a combination of wood-frame wrap or wood-frame podium. And those are often in either -- on transit TOD-type locations or certainly employment, and retail center-type locations. So that's really probably been the bigger shift, is really been from central core to kind of ex-urban infill-type sites where the economics are still dramatically different. If you just looked at the cost basis, call it as Stuart Street, or an Exeter, or an Nasser street in downtown Boston versus Assembly Row, which is only 3 miles away in Summerville. You're talking 50%, 60% of the basis in some cases. So that's been probably more the focus of the shift over the last 12 to 24 months in reality.","Matthew H. Birenbaum","This is Matt. Couple of numbers on that. What we currently have under construction is about 25% garden and the balance is evenly split between mid and high rise, 38% mid, 38% high. In our Development Rights -- Development Rights pipeline, the future starts, the garden percentage doesn't really change that's 25%. The high-rise drops from 38% to 15% and the mid rise is what moves to about 60% of the pipeline. Is that -- the bulk of what we're going to be starting is the wrap and podium deals in the infill suburban locations.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions, so I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Tim Naughton for any additional or closing remarks.","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, thank you, operator. And Tom, I think you got off pretty easy this quarter. Just a lot of thank you's. But anyway, thanks for being on the call today, and we look forward to seeing many of you, unfortunately without Tom, at the [indiscernible] conference in early June in New York. So look forward to seeing you there. Thanks. Take care.","Operator","And that does conclude today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation."],"2923":["AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

[Operator Instructions]. Your host for today's call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley","Thank you, Jessica, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There's a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.","As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy Naughton","Yes. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q1 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Sean, Matt and I will provide some brief comments on the slides that we posted last night, and then we'll all be available afterward for Q&A. Our comments will focus on providing a summary of Q1 results, an overview of development activity and lastly, progress in our expansion markets of Denver and Southeast Florida.","So now, starting on Slide 4. It was a solid quarter. Highlights include core FFO growth of 5.5%, driven by healthy internal growth, with same-store revenue and same-store NOI growth coming in at 3.4% and 4.9%, respectively. Interestingly, every region posted 3%-plus same-store revenue growth for the first time in over 6 years. ","As you recall from last quarter's earnings call, we expect little contribution to earnings in 2019 from external investment activity, primarily due to significantly lower apartment deliveries from our development portfolio this year; and secondly, the relatively higher cost of capital raised in late 2018, most of that being through dispositions. ","In Q1, we completed two communities at the very attractive suburban towns of Sudbury and Hingham in the Boston market, totaling $150 million at an average initial yield of 6.3%. And then lastly, we raised $220 million of capital, external capital in the quarter, 2\/3 of that being raised as equity from the CEP and the balance from a D.C. area disposition. The initial cost in this capital was 4.5%, and our leverage remains at a cyclical low of 4.6x debt-to-EBITDA. ","So with that, I'm going to turn it over now to Sean, who will discuss portfolio operations, including performance in our lease-ups. Sean?","Sean Breslin","All right. Thanks, Tim. Turning to Slide 5. Apartment fundamentals continue to support healthy rent change in the portfolio. This slide represents same-store rent change on a trailing 4-quarter average, which reached a high 2% level during Q1. As we've highlighted in the recent past, we believe the current pace of job and wage growth, combined with new supply of roughly 2% of stock, supports rent growth in the 2.5% to 3% range for our portfolio. ","Turning to Slide 6 to address Q1 specifically. Same-store rent change was 2.4% or 80 basis points above what we achieved during Q1 of 2018. This improved performance was primarily driven by our East Coast portfolio, which represents 52% of the overall same-store pool and produced roughly 150 basis points of improvement compared to last year. ","On the West Coast, we also achieved better rent change in the tech-driven Seattle and Northern California regions. Job growth has been quite healthy in both markets. In fact, it's actually running ahead of last year's pace through March. Southern California is the only region where rent change fell short of Q1 2018. While job growth in the region was roughly 1.25% for the full year 2018, it fell on to about half that rate in the last 6 months and is off to a weak start in 2019. ","Turning now to Slide 7 and the development portfolio. Our performance has been solid. For the 5 communities in lease-up during Q1, rents are trending about 3% ahead of pro forma. The total capital cost is projected to be within 1% of budget, and the weighted average stabilized yield is expected to be roughly 10 basis points ahead of plan at a very healthy 6.8%. ","And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt to talk further about development underway and our expansion markets. Matt?","Matthew Birenbaum","All right. Great. Thanks, Sean. Turning to Slide 8. We expect the $2.4 billion in development currently underway to generate $145 million in annual NOI once those communities are completed and stabilized. As we talked about last quarter, this year is a bit unusual for us in that very little of that NOI has begun to flow through to earnings yet, given the timing of the individual lease-ups and deliveries, but it should be a good source of growth over the next few years as those projects move to completion. While there is still some capital to fund to complete construction, the tick up in NOI should easily exceed the cost of the capital remaining to be sourced. ","Slide 9 shows the projected value creation from this development underway. If we apply a 4.5% cap rate to the $145 million in stabilized NOI, the value of these assets on completion would be $3.2 billion, which exceeds their projected costs by $800 million or roughly $5.75 per share. ","I also thought I would give a brief update on our progress in our new expansion markets of Denver and Southeast Florida. About 1.5 years ago, we announced a strategic expansion of our market footprint and indicated our intention to begin to rotate capital out of some of our legacy markets in the Northeast to these higher-growth regions of the country. As shown on Slide 10, we had begun this effort in Southeast Florida, acquiring 2 brand-new stabilized communities and breaking ground on a development community in partnership with a local sponsor. These 3 properties represent a $350 million investment in over 1,000 apartments and are a good start on assembling a diversified portfolio spanning 3 different submarkets and 3 different product types, from garden to mid-rise to high-rise. ","Turning to Slide 11. We have been even more active in Denver where we currently own 4 completed communities and one development site, with 2 additional development rights in the pipeline. This activity puts us on track to a portfolio of over $600 million and 2,000 units, again, diversified across a variety of different submarkets with a generally more suburban footprint so far. We've indicated a long-term goal of 5% allocation to each expansion market, so we expect to continue to grow our presence meaningfully via acquisitions, development and joint venture hybrid structures with local developers over the next few years. ","And with that, I'll turn it back to Tim for some concluding remarks.","Timothy Naughton","Well, yes. Thanks, Matt. So overall, Q1 was a very good quarter with results a bit better than expected. Same-store performance continue to improve with revenue growth generally in the 3% to 4% range across our footprint. The development portfolio is performing well and in line with our expectations, delivering or projected to deliver meaningful NAV growth over the next couple of years, as Matt just mentioned. And lastly, we're making solid progress in our expansion markets of Denver and Southeast Florida, having redeployed or committed almost $1 billion of capital through acquisitions and development to these markets over the last several quarters. ","And with that, Jessica, we're now -- open the call for Q&A. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Nick Joseph of Citi.","Nicholas Joseph","You discussed the strength of acceleration in the East Coast market, but within your portfolio, what are you seeing in terms of trends of urban versus suburban or A versus B?","Sean Breslin","Yes, Nick, it's Sean. Happy to chat about that a little bit, if you like. I mean, when you look at our portfolio specifically, one thing to keep in mind is the mix of As and Bs is not necessarily representative of the market. But in our portfolio, for the first time in about 15 quarters, in Q1, A did outperform B assets by about 50 basis points, but the majority of that is really supported by some acceleration in some of the higher price point assets on the East Coast, which has been a little bit softer over the past few years. So we certainly have seen that change in the outcome in terms of A\/B mix. If you look at it in terms of broader sort of market coverage and you look at Yardi or Axiometrics, they're showing it pretty much imbalanced at this point between A and B across our footprint, also supported by improvement in the A side of the product on the East Coast. In terms of urban-suburban, those spreads are still relatively wide, suburbans outperforming urban by about 50 to 60 basis points in our portfolio. And if you look across sort of the market footprint, again, looking at Yardi or Axiometrics, that spread is closer to about 100 basis points. So still seeing outperformance but varies by portfolio and market.","Nicholas Joseph","And then just curious if you can give an update on Columbus Circle, both in terms of where you are in the marketing process on the residential units and also the retail lease in.","Matthew Birenbaum","Sure, Nick. This is Matt. I'll take that one. On the retail side, just to remind folks, we have 67,000 square feet of retail there in total across 4 floors. About 43,000 square feet of that is leased, including all of the 2 subfloors, a little bit of the ground floor and a portion of the second floor. Since the last call, activity actually has picked up, and we are in what I'd say is advanced discussions for 17,000 of the remaining 24,000 square feet of space, including the remainder of the second floor and a good portion of the ground floor as well. So hopefully, those deals will proceed to lease, and we'll have more to report on that in the quarters to come, but we are seeing strong activity there. On the residential side, we did open our sales office there earlier this month, starting out really just with presales to broker contacts that were on the list. So we're not kind of open to the general public yet for walk-ins off the street. We're probably still a couple of weeks away from that. So we're really just now starting to get a read on the early sales activity side. I'm not going to comment on that yet. It's too early, but we do expect and we will provide more detailed update on the residential sales activity on our second quarter call.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Jeff Spector of Bank of America.","Jeffrey Spector","Hopefully, you can hear me?","Timothy Naughton","Yes.","Jeffrey Spector","Great. Sorry. Sorry, there was an interruption there. I guess just big picture, Tim, if we could talk about the macro. I think you maintained your -- the estimates, but just listening to your opening remarks, again, solid quarter, healthy internal growth, every region posted 3% rev growth for the first time in 6 years. I know none of us are economists and can't predict exactly the future, but everyone's trying to figure out any weakness in the economy or when the recession will come. I guess, from where you sit, things seem pretty strong.","Timothy Naughton","Yes, Jeff. I'd say things more or less played out so far as we would expect it or projected when we gave our guidance a quarter ago. I mean, I think, our job growth outlook was down from the prior year at 1.2% for our markets. But on the other hand, we do expect stronger wage growth. We're projecting wage growth, as you recall, of 3.5% and supply growth in the low 2% range. Not much has really changed from that. We did say on the call though that we do expect economic growth to moderate over the course of the year to be maybe a little bit more of a -- be a bit of a mirror image from what we saw in 2018. Now I don't think we changed our view on that, I mean, just based upon the -- a little bit of slowdown on the global growth -- in global growth, just the stimulus from the tax reform starting to wear off. If you look at -- Sean spoke a little bit about job growth, if you look at what we've seen over the last 6 months and 3 months, more or less in line with our expectations, but there are regional differences. Northern California, New York area have been a bit stronger than we anticipated. Southern California, weaker, as Sean mentioned. ","And probably the other thing that's maybe a little different than what we expected three months ago is the for sale is slowing down a bit, both in terms of volume and pricing. And I think you may have seen just in the last 24 hours just homeownership rate actually came down for the first time, I think, in the last couple of years. It's just one data point. But when you combine that with consumer confidence being down a little bit, those are probably the things we're watching right now, for in terms of as leading indicators but really have been reflected certainly in terms of portfolio performance today.","Jeffrey Spector","Okay. And then, my one follow-up, just on the Northeast region, I guess, in particular, maybe New York City or Manhattan, I believe you somewhat commented that the luxury end was maybe better than expected in 1Q. I guess, what are you seeing in the Northeast, the East Coast that was better than expected year-to-date?","Sean Breslin","Yes, Jeff, Sean. Happy to tell you about that a little bit. I mean, I think, the way to describe it is that pretty much across the East Coast footprint, things are, I would say, about where we expect it, maybe slightly better in a couple of areas, but for the most part, somewhat in line, as Tim mentioned too, as it relates to his response to the prior question. In terms of specific markets or submarkets within regions, there are differences, so to give you some examples, in the Metro New York and New Jersey area. As an example, Long Island is quite strong, doing almost 5% year-over-year. And the other markets in and around New York City, New York suburban and B, and Westchester, Northern New Jersey are more like 1% to 2%. That's certainly better in the case of New York City than maybe what we've seen. But in terms of absolute price points and what is improvement, I'd say, as I mentioned in the last response, we are seeing some pretty good acceleration in some of the higher-end price points in some of these submarkets, which has been helpful. And if you dissect it, it's really more a question about where the pockets of supply are most plentiful, where the impact is greatest on the higher-end assets. That's really what's driving it in terms of the difference in pricing power between the higher-end and, say, the more moderately priced assets. So a specific example is D.C. proper is on the weaker side as opposed to suburban Virginia -- or Northern Virginia, suburban Maryland are much more healthy at this point, and it's just a function of the amount of supply being delivered in the district right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hightower of Evercore ISI.","Richard Hightower","So I want to -- I know we've talked about this earlier today, but maybe just for the benefit of everyone on the call, just to kind of walk through the bad debt accounting change and its impact on same-store during the quarter. So can you help us just collectively understand the breakdown in better-than-expected performance across the accounting change, across occupancy, market rents, other revenues and just help us understand the building blocks so we're all on the same page.","Sean Breslin","Yes, this is Sean. Why don't I go through it at a fairly high level. To the extent there's a lot of detailed questions about drivers of other rental revenue and things like that, that may be more appropriate to take off-line. But in terms of the broad view of the TRR growth or rental revenue growth in Q1, the impact from the change in bad debt is 30 basis points. Regionally, the range is sort of between 0 and call it, 60, 70 basis points, depending on the specific region. And that is a reflection of underlying changes year-over-year in bad debt, which are really driven by a couple of factors. One is some investments we made in data analytics to improve our bad debt profile in the residential side, both in terms of people coming to our communities as well as our collection processes. ","And the second piece of that is in certain regions, in particular, we had some write-offs as it relates to retail tenants in Q1 of 2018 that we don't have in 2019, and that really accounts for some of those regional differences that occur. But the overall broad impact, again, is the 30 basis points. We had mentioned that -- when we were at the Citi conference that we were trending about 20 basis points ahead of what we had expected in terms of revenue growth through January and February. So if you look at the full Q1 number in terms of our outperformance, basically about half of it is in just raw performance mainly driven by occupancy, and the other half essentially is the bad debt component is the way I look at it in terms of from a revenue perspective. On the OpEx side of things, we reported Q1 OpEx growth of 20 basis points. That actually would have been down 90 basis points year-over-year in Q1 if bad debt had remained expensed. So that's the full impact on Q1. Hopefully, that's clear.","Richard Hightower","Okay. Yes. I appreciate the detail there, and we'll probably have a few follow-ups, but I'm going to take a stab at the next question here, and feel free not to answer because I know Avalon's policy on guidance and everything. But is it fair to say that on an all-else-equal basis, given everything that you just described in terms of the building blocks that a same-store range should go up because of what you described? Or is it not fair to say that and we can interpret that as we wish?","Kevin O'Shea","Rich, this is Kevin. I guess, at the outset, just to say what we said before, we're not intending to update guidance until the second quarter. So we don't really have any additional comment on that. I think, one question that's embedded in what you're asking is if we had known back in the beginning of the year when we gave our initial guidance that bad debt would need to be moved geographically up into revenue, would we have changed our guidance? The answer is no because we did not forecast at that point in time a material improvement in bad debt recoveries. So those are probably the 2 points that I'd emphasize for you to consider.","Operator","Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","You guys have sustained a positive spread on like-term lease rates now for the past three quarters, I believe. So does the same-store revenue guidance assume that those lease rate spreads converge by year-end or that you continue to sustain some level of a positive spread each quarter throughout the year?","Sean Breslin","Yes. Austin, this is Sean. I think, what I said in my prepared remarks in last quarter is that, on average, throughout the year, we expected rent change, like-term rent change to be 20 basis points greater in 2019 as compared to 2018. We didn't specifically go under the quarterly numbers, but that's what we expected for the full year.","Austin Wurschmidt","Got it. And then can you just provide a little bit of an update on what you've seen into April as far as lease rate trends?","Sean Breslin","Sure. Thus far, through April, rent change is running 3.1%, which is about 50, 60 basis points above April of last year. And the renewal offers are basically going out in the 5% range for May and June.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Appreciate that. And then just last one for me. As far as leverage, you kind of have held steady within that 4.6x range now for the last couple of quarters. And just curious if we should expect that to continue to tick up? Or has the opportunity to issue a little bit of equity under the ATM given your ability to kind of sustain lower leverage, and that's really your intention now moving forward?","Kevin O'Shea","Austin, this is Kevin. I think, as I indicated the last quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA fell at around 4.6 turns, which is where it is today and where it was last quarter. And that was primarily driven by the closing of our New York City joint venture transaction, among the other dispositions that we completed last year, as Tim alluded to in his opening remarks. So that was sort of an outcome of a portfolio set of activities that we undertook. It wasn't really a direct objective of ours, and so it sort of came about as a result of selling those assets. As we've mentioned in the past, over a full cycle, we'd like to have our leverage run somewhere between 5 and 6 turns, and we're comfortable being a little bit above or a little bit below that. At this point in the cycle, our preference is to be more around 5 turns. We happen to be a little bit below that today, and I guess what I'd say is we're relatively comfortable with where we are now. It may be that it probably ticks up a little bit, but I don't think there's any great haste in doing so. And while we are where we are, we feel like we have incremental financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that might be out there.","Timothy Naughton","Kevin, maybe just remind Austin sort of what the capital plan was for this year just in terms of sort of mix.","Kevin O'Shea","Sure. Yes. Just as a reference, when we began the year, our capital plan for 2019 contemplated sourcing $1 billion of external capital, with roughly half of that to come in the form of newly issued debt, and the other half in the form of equity, which we planned would be net disposition activity. And in terms of where we are today, as you know from reading the release, we sourced $150 million in equity issuance. And then in terms of net disposition activity, we sourced an initial $80 million. We've got probably a couple hundred million or so of assets during the market today. So I'd say the capital plan, while it can certainly change based on market conditions and changes in capital uses in terms of where we stand today, I think we're kind of roughly intact in terms of where we are on the capital plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank.","Nicholas Yulico","Just a question on the same-store expense growth, looked unusually low this quarter, and I guess you did have that 3% year-over-year drop in payroll and office costs. You talked about lower bonuses, lower overheads. So I guess I'm just wondering what -- hear a little bit more about what drove that and how we should think about that versus the same-store expense guidance this year, which was 3%, and you only did just over flat in the first quarter.","Sean Breslin","Yes, Nick. This is Sean. Happy to take that one. As it relates to Q1, as you pointed out, we certainly had some things go our way as well as a pretty good comp as it relates to last year. So it certainly had some benefit on the marketing side, certainly on the utility side. As you noted maybe, property taxes were basically 1% in the first quarter. As we move through the year, you start to see things pick up in some of these other categories. So for example, over the next couple of quarters, you'll see merit increases kick in on the payroll side. You'll see more normal property tax growth in the first quarter. We had the benefit of an appeal that kicked in, which was helpful to us as well as a rate reset in Seattle. So you've got some of those one-off things in the first quarter that helped us that will not recur in the second quarter, and then we have a tougher comp on utilities in Q2 and things like that. So we certainly had a benefit across multiple categories in Q1, except -- expect to see a tick up a little bit in Q2, and you'll start to see that pattern. ","As it relates to maybe payroll and some other things and how you should think about it over the next couple of years, maybe just a couple things to mention. So on the property tax side, assessments have grown materially this cycle, we don't have a lot of 421-a exposure. So I expect that the property tax growth should be less over the next couple of years than it's been the last 2 or 3 years. ","And then maybe just to touch on a couple of other things that are certainly working well for us in terms of being able to contain OpEx growth, maybe mention a couple of categories. One is payroll, which, as you know, is about 24% of our OpEx. We've been investing in a number of initiatives that will continue to allow us to contain payroll growth in the future. And just to cite a few examples, through additional potting and other consolidation efforts, we reduced on-site office headcount by about 3.5% year-over-year in Q1. In addition, during Q1, we launched an AI platform to facilitate interactions between an automated agent and our prospects. While it's still early, we're seeing better conversion rates from a platform that runs 24\/7 and doesn't require interaction with our on-site staff.","And overall, I mean, we're investing in other opportunities to use technology to enhance the self-service experience for our customers but also allow our staff to be more efficient and effective. And that's all being done by leveraging both automation and centralization, which is allowing us to think about maybe a little bit different sales and service model at our communities. So that's certainly helpful, not only as we think about payroll this year but over the next couple of years, and we're also making investments in other areas in terms of utilities and our renewable energy efforts and other sustainability initiatives. And on the marketing side, doing a lot of great things with organic search for our website and a number of self-service tools that we launched about 18 months ago where we're seeing great penetration from our customers. So they can schedule tours online, bypassing the call center, which reduces some of those costs. So overall, while we're facing pressure in some areas, maybe like repairs and maintenance, we do think investments in some of these other areas are going to pay off for us over the next couple of years.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. That's very helpful. In terms of rent control taking more of a focus in New York, there could be some changes that could happen in June. Can you just break out for when we look at your Metro New York portfolio, how much is subject to, let's say, rent stabilization in New York City, if any of the suburban assets, any of the units there are also subject? And I guess, just separately, within New York City, how much of the 80-20 buildings you still own where you're getting the 421-a tax abatement?","Sean Breslin","Yes, happy to chat about that a little bit. As you know, it's a complicated issue in New York because there's different classifications of buildings that are regulated and for what purpose. So there's certainly buildings with very low rent that are rent stabilized at very different types of levels. But in terms of what we're talking about, which is essentially a market rate portfolio subject to 421-a with stabilized units, for us, our stabilized -- or same-store pool is about 3,800 apartment homes. Of that, about 2\/3 roughly are what's considered market-stabilized. And of that 2\/3, there's only about 20% of it that's capped at what is known as the legal rent. So the others are paying what's known as a preferential rent, if you understand the terms, where they effectively are in a loss to lease position is probably the simple way to describe it. ","So that's what we have in terms of our same-store assets. There's a lot of things being talked about in York in terms of what would be impacted. For the most part, based on what we're hearing through a pretty strong organization in REBNY is that the target is typically much more of a lower price point assets that are regulated where people are spending a lot of energy trying to figure out what should happen with the policies associated with those assets and not as much time on the market rate side. There are certainly some chatter about the market rate side, but based on what we know, there seems to be a greater focus on the lower price point, particularly issues of displacement and things like that. And we'll know more certainly as we get to June, but there's some debate on that as we get into May as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Babin of Baird.","Andrew Babin","A quick question on L.A., drilling in a little bit. Obviously, supply in downtown L.A. has been elevated and concessions are pretty aggressive. Given that you don't have many properties or any properties really in downtown L.A., I thought I'd ask kind of where within L.A. you may be seeing some of the softness that occurred in the first quarter. And if you can also give an update on how things are kind of progressing in April, that will be very helpful.","Sean Breslin","Sure. Drew, this is Sean. Happy to chat about that. You are correct in that we have one same-store asset in downtown L.A. and Little Tokyo. Fortunately, it is at a price point where it's actually performing quite well right now. But in terms of the rest of the assets, I'd say the slowness that we're seeing in L.A. is relatively widespread. It's a little bit more in the San Fernando Valley specifically. But when you look at the individual assets across the San Fernando Valley and L.A., there are certain pockets where it's weaker, maybe at the margin a little bit. But I'd say we expected some slowdown in Southern California, as reflected in the chart that we presented during the Q1 call, where we you show sort of the distribution of anticipated revenue growth. Southern California was the only region where we expected it to be down. Job growth had already started to slow. And so we forecasted that for the most part. ","I would say a certain pocket in San Fernando Valley as an example might be a little bit weaker than what we anticipated. I think the issue that will play out in Southern California this year a little bit that people may not be as clear about is there are some anti-rent gouging caps in place throughout parts of Los Angeles right now as a result of the fires from last year. Those caps are in place through November of 2019. And while it's a 10% cap and you don't think of it being material, what it does impact is your ability to generate and execute short-term leases at premiums through the summer season. And so some acceleration that you might typically see in L.A. through the summer and as you generate short-term leases for a variety of different types of customers, that incremental revenue is not anticipated to come through this year at the same extent that it did last year because of the nature of these caps where you can't increase the rent by more than 10% of the amount the prior customer was paying for that specific unit. So some of those nuances are at play as well, but in terms of the environment, I would say, across L.A., it's been a little bit weaker than we would have anticipated but not too far off.","Andrew Babin","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on East Bay. Obviously, it was one of the slower revenue growth markets during the first quarter. I guess it would be helpful if you could talk about kind of with -- in the context of Northern California doing better than expectations, would you say that Oakland East Bay is sort of performing in line with what you expected going into the year, given the supplier hasn't been a little bit weaker than you expected?","Sean Breslin","Yes. No. Good question. We certainly expect that San Jose and San Francisco to perform better than the East Bay. A combination of several different factors, including just the nature of the job growth that we expected across the footprint there as well as certain pockets of supply. I'd say our assets in Walnut Creek are performing quite well, but assets in Pleasanton and Dublin not quite as much. So it's one of those places where, as you probably know, the East Bay sort of lagged performance in San Jose and San Francisco. We've seen a rebound come through in both of those market areas, and the East Bay tends to lag, and it is, this year, lagging as well. So not a surprise.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.","Piljung Kim","On the uncollectible lease revenue or bad debt, has this figure been trending down over the last few years? And how does this really compare to historic levels? And is it something that you're going to be breaking out in future years? Or was it just this year because of the accounting change?","Sean Breslin","Yes, John. Happy to chat about that. In terms of the year-over-year change, I'd say, what we're seeing right now, what we saw this year Q1, to be specific, is a little bit more than normal in terms of year-over-year reduction in bad debt, which fueled the 30 basis point increase in the revenue numbers that we put out. And really driven by two things. One, I mentioned some investments we had made recently over the last year or two in data analytics, and that has led to some pretty good outcomes as it relates to both how we screen residents coming into our communities as well as the collection efforts that our customer care center in terms of sort of queuing theory and how we pursue customers on the collections side. Both of those have had a meaningful impact in terms of cohorts of moved-ins over the last 12 months, so you'll see that play through over the next couple quarters in particular. Certainly the most meaningful one, I would say. So that's had a big lift. And then, certainly, Q1, I think I mentioned earlier, we had a couple of retail write-offs in Q1 of 2018 that we don't have in Q1 '19, that also helped us. So I would say, the bad debt, it certainly cycles with the economy. So it's come down quite a bit from the Great Recession, but I'd say the incremental improvement that you're seeing now is really primarily a function of our investment in data analytics and screening customers better and the collection side.","Piljung Kim","And then are you going to provide this figure going forward? Or is it just listings?","Sean Breslin","Sorry, didn't address that. It's really just for this year. We don't anticipate doing that going forward. It's just sort of a transition year for us.","Piljung Kim","Okay. Looks like you didn't have any development starts this quarter. I was wondering if you're still on track for the $950 million of starts in your guidance for the year?","Matthew Birenbaum","John, it's Matt. We'll see. I think there were specific projects identified, and they're all moving through. We certainly are going to start at least a couple of deals this quarter. The exact timing on some of these does tend to move around a little bit. So we may hit it. We may have a couple of deals that slide a quarter or 2, would cause us to miss it, but it's too early to tell.","Timothy Naughton","And John, we'll certainly update, as part of our midyear guidance update as well, what we expect for that. As Matt said, it's kind of premature to update you on that at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee of Stifel.","John Guinee","A couple of quick questions. One is Oakwood Arlington, we're sort of surprised to see you sell that given all the hype in Arlington. Can you pinpoint exactly where that's located in your thought process and pricing?","Matthew Birenbaum","Sure. This is Matt. That was -- that's a very unusual asset or it was a very unusual asset in our portfolio. It's late '80s vintage, 30-year old asset located in Roslin. So here in Arlington and Northern Virginia. We actually acquired that asset through the Archstone acquisition, and it was master leased to Oakwood who was operating it as furnished housing, and that master lease was actually nearing the end of its term. So when we looked at taking it back to market operations, combination of the capital that would be required and where we expected the NOI to go, we think it was about a 4 cap, which is lower than I think if it had been a conventionally operated community. And Oakwood actually was the buyer. So kind it of fit with their program of actually starting to buy some assets as well as operate assets. So it was just a unique combination of events there. We weren't necessarily looking to sell it. We were just part of the negotiation of the lease extension. It became clear they had an interest in owning a real estate, and at that price, we had an interest in selling it.","John Guinee","Great. And then the second question regarding hard costs at Washington, D.C. in particular, but elsewhere. What are you seeing? What did you see in the last year? And what's your projection for the next 12, 24 months in terms of hard cost increases?","Matthew Birenbaum","Yes. It's Matt again. I guess I can take a shot at that one, and others, feel free to chime in. The D.C. market has been -- certainly, hard cost inflation has exceeded rent growth, which has been very modest. But compared to most of our markets, it's been somewhat more muted. So I'd call it probably 3% to 5% maybe. We're just getting ready to break ground actually on a wood frame project in suburban Baltimore this quarter, so we do have some fairly current numbers on that. ","Other markets, we're still seeing mid-single digits, and the West Coast is still probably high single digits in terms of the inflation of hard cost commodities. Lumber actually has come down. So that hopefully will start to help, but still, the overwhelming driver is labor. One of the things we have seen just very recently is labor availability pick up a little bit on the West Coast and better subcontractor coverage on our bids. That has not yet chased its way through into a cessation of pretty aggressive inflation, but that's, I'd say, a necessary but not sufficient precursor. So maybe, maybe it comes down a little bit looking forward over the next 12 to 18 months, but it's very speculative.","Timothy Naughton","John, this is Tim. As you know D.C., it's always been sort of a deeper subcontractor market here, and so we've only had periods of development and supply. We tend not to have the same kind of swings in construction pricing. So we never really saw the West Coast even when production levels got up to sort of cyclical highs here, and so I don't think we anticipate dramatic disruption of inflation in the mid-Atlantic over the next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill","I wanted to just come back to New York for a second. You've been vocal in the past about maybe allocating away from New York City to higher growth markets, but you obviously had a pretty nice rebound in this market. And there were some commentary that led me to believe that it was widespread. So I am curious, is it as widespread as maybe I perceived? Or do you think it's reflective of fruits of your labor pruning your portfolio and really focusing on properties that make the most sense in the greater New York City area?","Sean Breslin","Yes. Rich, this is Sean. Happy to provide a couple of comments on that. I mean, as I mentioned, I think, earlier, the suburban markets are probably performing a little bit better, but New York City is starting to show some life, let's just say. I mean, it's not going gangbusters for a change in the city in Q1 with only 1.5% as compared to say, Long Island was 5% as an example. So I would say that the assets that we have in the same-store pool today are pretty well-positioned. So for example, the 2 high-rises on the waterfront Long Island City is sort of leading the charge in terms of revenue growth, but our Brooklyn assets are doing fine as well, particularly Fort Greene, which is at a different price point from a lot of the newer product that's being delivered in and around that submarket. So I'd say, overall, we're seeing improvement, and depending on where you are and the amount of supply being delivered in that particular neighborhood, has a material impact on the performance of assets in the city specifically.","Richard Hill","Okay. Helpful. And then, one of the things that you highlighted in your investor presentation was the increase in effective rents, which has been ongoing for some and I guess, for a couple of quarters now. I'm curious, as you head into peak leasing season, how are you thinking about occupancies versus rents? And do you think your portfolio is particularly well-positioned to push rents from here?","Sean Breslin","Yes. Happy to take that one. That's a process that is ever ongoing, I guess I would say, that we feel like we're in a position from an occupancy standpoint certainly to push rents, but it is not only a submarket-by-submarket. It's an asset-by-asset process that has a lot of discipline behind it in terms of revenue management blended with efforts from our market research group to try to optimize the revenue growth from an asset. So it's not necessarily one answer to solve all of that. In some cases, it's more protecting occupancy like in the district where there's a lot of supply right now in trying to extend lease duration. Yes, that's one strategy. In a market that's rebounding, maybe more like a San Francisco or parts of Boston, we might yield a slightly more occupancy to generate better renewal rates or move-in rates. So it's an ongoing process. We're comfortable with how we're positioned, and the strategy changes from asset to asset depending on the nature of the environment.","Timothy Naughton","Rich, Tim here. Just maybe just to add a little bit to that. I mean, occupancy is healthy across our markets, but it's been healthy really the entire cycle. And ultimately, it's going to be a function, I think, mostly of, as Sean said, supply and demand within that particular market. But what's interesting is as you look across the entire housing market, homeowner -- including for-sale and single-family, housing vacancy is at a 30-year low, which does provide some additional support, I think, to continue to sort of push pricing.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","Circling back to your comments on the political scene in Albany, so if the Real Estate Board of New York's most likely scenario plays out, I guess, what percent of your New York units would feel some sort of impact?","Sean Breslin","John, this is Sean. It depends on how it plays out, but the focus is really on the very low rent regulated units. There's 0 risk for us in terms of impact on what we can charge for assets that we own. I think the date on that is 1974 is my recollection in terms of date of construction, but it's also a rent threshold as well, those kind of 2 variables that go together. So the impact would be negligible, 0 in that specific case.","John Pawlowski","Sure. So your political contacts aren't concerned at all about the vacancy control threshold being strengthened?","Sean Breslin","I wouldn't say that they're not concerned. I would say that they're -- in the case of both California and New York, there are some pretty strong organizations there with deep relationships in the sort of political apparatus, if you want to call it that, that they're working those relationships, they're working to make sure people are educated about the unintended consequences of certain policy issues that could be adopted. And so we think the efforts, particularly in those 2 states, with the organizations that we have, have been successful in the past and hope that they would be successful in the future. No guarantees by any means, but that's just based on what we know today.","John Pawlowski","Understood. And then, Sean, your comments about the Orange County being off to a slow start, has the sluggishness persisted in early 2Q? And can you share some leasing stats for Orange County in April?","Sean Breslin","Yes. I'd say, generally, across Southern California, as I mentioned earlier, we anticipated it to be weaker than the other markets just if you look at year-over-year revenue growth that we had laid out. That certainly has been the case across all 3 markets in Q1 and continuing into April, L.A., Orange County and San Diego. If you look at it from the perspective of rent change, for example, in Q1 in the L.A. and San Fernando Valley is kind of 2% to 3% range. It was weaker actually in Orange County and San Diego, more in the mid-1% range. We're seeing some acceleration into April, but that's more seasonal than anything else. So to give you some reference points, we're averaging more like 3% in L.A. right now on a blended basis for April, almost 3% in Orange County and about 2.5% in San Diego. So there's some seasonal component to that obviously in terms of the lift. But when you compare that to healthier environments where we would have had better job growth, we certainly would be putting up better numbers in terms of rent change across that geography.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will now take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","So my first question is, Tim, just going again back to New York with the recent energy efficiency legislation they passed, I don't know if you guys have had a chance to assess the legislation versus your buildings. But if you have, can you just give us a sense for how you guys would trend towards the initial 2024 mandates?","Matthew Birenbaum","Sure, Alex. This is Matt. I can speak to that a little bit. It is obviously hot off the press, so we're still digesting it. But a couple things. Number one, I believe buildings with rent-regulated units may be exempt, which would be most of our buildings. But there are a few that are not, and it's perhaps still unclear exactly how wide that net might get cast. But as we look at it, our buildings score pretty well. Most of our buildings are actually probably performing today in a place that they would meet the 24 to 29 targets. There's a few that are a little bit over, but we continue to make investments in cogen and solar and other things. So we've actually been leaders in this area, and I think we're pretty well-positioned.","Timothy Naughton","Alex, just to add on to that a little bit. There's really one building that matters for us that doesn't have regulated units, which is the Riverview buildings in Long Island City, and we have cogen there. So we're pretty comfortable that one's going to clear.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question is as you ramp up more in Denver and South Florida, has there been any change in sort of what you guys initially thought that you would -- where you would invest, whether it's acquisition or development and then submarkets. Has anything changed now that you've put $1 billion in, are you still according to plan? Or have some things changed where you're finding out maybe it's easier to develop or maybe there are more developers who want to sell you their lease-up assets or something?","Matthew Birenbaum","Yes. Sure, Alex. It's Matt. I would say, it's been pretty much as we had expected and as we had hoped. We did not -- we said that we were going to go into those markets with a goal of reaching that 5% for each, but that we didn't put any particular time frame on it because we were going to do it in a way that was responsive to market conditions. We know there's a lot of merchant build activity in both those markets, so there've been a lot of new assets to acquire, which we've been focused on. ","I'd say, we expected to be more active in vertical developments sooner in Denver, just given some of our personnel and knowledge of those markets, and that's played out where we actually own one development site there that will start later this year, hopefully. And we actually have 2 others working their way through the due diligence process. So -- but all of the above. We continue to look for acquisitions, we continue to talk to developers about JVs, and we continue to look for development sites. So it's been, I'd say, pretty much what we had hoped for, and we'll continue to proceed as market opportunities allow.","Operator","Our final question comes from Hardik Goel of Zelman & Associates.","Hardik Goel","I had two quick ones. So first one on the transaction markets in New York and D.C. Have you guys noticed some slowdown there? We heard some reports that investors were holding back before the rental guideline board meets in June in New York, and something similar in D.C. with regards to people, the transaction market as being sluggish.","Matthew Birenbaum","Hardik, it's Matt. We're not active in the New York transaction market right now at this moment. Obviously, we were last year. So I can't comment on that specifically other than transaction market in general in our markets was down a little bit in the first quarter, and there has been some concern in D.C. There has been a little bit of concern about some changes to the rent control ordinance as it relates to older assets. Again, I think that's pre-'78 constructions. So there were some changes there that may have slowed that transaction market a little bit, but it's hard to tell in D.C. because you have the TOPA law, which gives the tenants the right to organize to buy the building and match third-party offers. So any transactions you see closing in D.C. are transactions that were struck anywhere from 6 to 12 months earlier. So to the extent there's an impact on the market with assets in the market today, you wouldn't necessarily see that in the closing statistics for another couple of quarters.","Hardik Goel","Got it. And just another quick one on your same-store revenue number. The way I understand it is if I roll up your sequentials, I'm getting to a 2.7% to 2.8% growth rate, and the gap between the 3.4% and that is 75 basis points or so. 30 of that is your bad debt change, the reporting change, as you guys mentioned, and the remaining seems to be from the change in the same-store pool. Can you give me the growth rate for the incoming units into the pool or the units that are not comparable in the pool? Do you have a rough range?","Sean Breslin","Yes. Hardik, this is Sean. For the 2019 same-store pool, the entrants into that pool from development and redevelopment activity that has stabilized previous to that is a little greater than it normally is. It was almost 10% of the pool, and growth rates in those assets remaining in the pool was in the low 6% range. So they are growing faster than the base. So that -- some changes in other rental revenue associated with those communities, that's coming through that -- nudges that up a little bit more even, and then the bad debt change are sort of the big components, as you pointed out.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Tim Naughton for closing remarks.","Timothy Naughton","Well, thank you, Jessica, and thanks all for being on the call today.

Following the remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley - Senior Director of Investor Relations","Well, thank you, Aaron, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities' first quarter 2016 earnings conference call.","Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially.

Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q1 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin, and Matt Birenbaum. I will be providing management commentary on the slides that were posted yesterday afternoon and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.","My comments will focus on providing summary of Q1 results, talk about trends in the apartment market and our portfolio and lastly, I'll share some thoughts on capital allocation and portfolio management.","So, starting on slide four, it was a strong quarter, this past quarter, where we achieved core FFO growth of more than 12.5%, fueled by healthy same-store revenue growth of 5.5% and same-store NOI growth of almost 8% as well as contributions coming from our lease-up portfolio from our $2.7 billion development pipeline.","As we mentioned last quarter, external growth from investment activity has contributed roughly 45% of core FFO growth over the last two years and it continues to add meaningfully to FFO growth in 2016. We were active on the portfolio management front as well this past quarter, closing out $240 million in acquisitions and almost $0.5 billion in dispositions.","Turning now to slide five; recent market trends reflect shifting patterns across our footprint. This chart shows year-over-year changes in effective rent for each of our six regions and for the full market, as reported by Axiometrics. A few trends worth noting include, first, effective rent growth on the West Coast continues to outpace the East Coast by about 400 basis points, running around 6% in the West and roughly 2% in the East during the quarter.","Second, the New York and Northern California regions are seeing some deceleration, while our other regions remained stable or are improving. New York has been impacted by new supply while Northern California's performance is being driven by a combination of supply, a slower job growth in last year this time and tough year-over-year comps. Southern California, Seattle continue to post strong gains while DC is beginning to show modest improvement.","The last point worth mentioning is that these charts really do demonstrate the apartment cycle can ebb and flow similar to what we experienced in the 1990s. With deliveries beginning to stabilize, rent growth is likely to balance around a bit, driven more by the demand side of the equation including demographic shifts, growth in employment wages and the pace of household formation.","Turning to slide six, looking at our portfolio, we can see that the average rent change in the market is consistent with our portfolio and the overall market trends and remains healthy in the 4% range. This rate of growth is down from last year, but is consistent with our expectations as more supply is coming online this year. In addition, similar to the prior set of charts, our portfolio reflects markets that can be somewhat choppy across the cycle. In fact, just in this cycle, we have seen three periods when rent growth has been above the average and three when it's been below the average and during the time span of less than six years.","Turning to slide seven, after having trailed in rent growth versus urban submarkets early this cycle, suburban submarkets began to outperform over the last couple of years. This trend has been driven by expanding development pipelines and inventory that began to build in many urban submarkets across our region starting in 2013, outpacing suburban deliveries during this time. We believe that this trend of suburban outperformance is likely to continue over the next two to three years, given that urban deliveries should be about two times that of the suburbs through 2017.","As capital allocators and active developers, we've been talking about this over the last couple of years. We began shifting our focus two to three years ago towards suburban submarkets, particularly infill areas where we saw better value and less supply. But however, just as I mentioned, how market performance can ebb and flow across the cycle by region, the same is true for submarkets.","As capital flows shift their response to these trends, we'll continue to be opportunistic in search of the most compelling risk-adjusted returns, whether they'd be in target suburban or urban submarkets. And in fact, over our 20-plus year history, we've achieved similar returns in urban and suburban submarkets across our region. We've been able to do this by taking a fine-grained approach to capital allocation, directing new investment to the highest risk-adjusted returns at any particular point in time.","Now turning to slide eight, another capital allocation topic I'd like to touch on relates to our level of development as the cycle matures. This slide depicts realized and estimated unrealized IRRs of development completions sorted by completion dates through 2013. On our last quarter, we discussed strategies we are deploying to mitigate risk posed by our development efforts, including pipeline diversification, managing land inventory, and match-funding new commitments. This quarter we thought it might be helpful to look at how development has performed historically based upon cycle timing and timing of delivery.","As you can see and might expect, developments generate its highest returns during periods of economic expansion, particularly in the earlier years of expansion where projects may have been started during the prior downturn or in the early recovery portion of the current cycle. What perhaps is less intuitive is our history of generating healthy returns for projects that delivered during the contraction phase of the cycle and that were most likely started during the latter portion of the prior cycle, a point in time when land and construction costs are generally peaking.","Across all parts of the cycle, we have been able to comfortably clear our cost of capital and deliver NAV to shareholders through development. My point here is not that development always makes sense, but rather that we can continue to create value through this capability during downturns, if deployed in a skillful, rigorous and disciplined way that focuses our efforts and resources on the most compelling opportunities in our markets.","Turning to slide nine, it stands to reason that as we pursue development in a disciplined manner, as the cycle matures, it ought to result in a diminished opportunity set as fewer deals meet required hurdle rates. And, in fact, this is the case. Since 2013, while our development pipeline as measured by total capital investment has more or less leveled off, when measured as a percentage of total enterprise value or even by the number of projects, it's declined by roughly 25% to 30%. So we believe that we can continue to create shareholder value through new development at this point in the cycle, albeit at a lesser rate perhaps than earlier in the cycle.","Lastly turning to slide 10, we've been active in the transaction market recently and I wanted to share a couple of thoughts with respect to our activities in this area of our business. Over the last few months, we've purchased or cleared due diligence on three communities totaling over $300 million of total investment. Each of these communities are high quality assets with high walk scores and great submarkets, located in Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia and Hoboken, New Jersey. With many merchant built development deals completing and some investment funds unwinding, we are seeing some excellent assets come to market, much of it unencumbered by long-term debt and expensive prepayment penalties.","These acquisitions are being funded in turn through asset sale proceeds from funds and wholly-owned dispositions, some of which will trade as 1031 exchanges with acquisitions. As a result, our level of asset sales will be dependent on acquisition volume. As we identify acquisitions that we believe can improve the risk adjusted returns of our portfolio, we'll pair them with the sale of non-core assets. But overall, we do plan on being a net seller of assets this year. We're just taking advantage of an active market to improve the portfolio.","So in summary, before opening it up to Q&A, I'd just like to say Q1 was another strong quarter for AVB, achieving double-digit growth in core FFO for the fourth consecutive quarter. While we're seeing some moderation in fundamentals and operating trends, they remain healthy. The sector will continue to benefit from favorable demographics and living patterns of Millennials and Gen X, while new deliveries should begin to stabilize in 2016 at levels that are at or below structural demand for apartment housing.","As we move into the mature portion of the economic expansion, we'll remain disciplined capital allocators and risk managers, recognizing that we can continue to create meaningful value for shareholders through new development, employing the talent and rigor that we've demonstrated over the several cycles during the past 20 plus years.","And with that, Aaron, we'd be happy to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, sir. And we'll take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. I'm wondering, in terms of operations, if you can talk about how the first quarter trended relative to where you thought it would at the beginning of the year and which markets are ahead of expectation so far and maybe which are behind?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Nick, it's Sean. Happy to do that. Overall, based on performance in the first quarter, and what we know about the second quarter thus far, we're basically in line with our overall expectations for revenue. New York is a little bit behind, but Southern Cal, Pacific Northwest and the Mid Atlantic are a little bit ahead, more than offsetting New York. And then the other two major regions, Boston and the Northern California region are basically in line with our original budget.","In terms of to provide a little more color maybe on where we are in terms of recent trends, in the first quarter, rent change was 3.7%, it's trended up in April to 4.2%, which is renewals in the mid 5%s and move-ins in the high 2%s, getting to that 4.2%. And to provide some context, when we planned for the year, our expectation is that rent change throughout the year would average about 4.5%, which is down about 120 basis points from what we realized in rent change in 2015.","So, based on where we are now moving into the second quarter of the stronger leasing season when rents really start to ramp up, our expectation is pretty consistent with what's happening in the portfolio. And particularly, if you look towards the stronger season and renewal offers, I think we're in pretty good shape. May and June renewal offers are out in the high 6% range. And that's basically a blend of, call it, 5% in the Mid-Atlantic and New York, about 6.5% in Boston, about 8% in Northern Cal and Southern Cal, and about 10% in Seattle.","So, overall, we think we're in pretty good shape. Things are unfolding sort of as we expected, and as we look forward into the rest of the second quarter, we're in pretty good position. Occupancy wise, we're 95.7% at this point which is about 20 basis points below this point last year and availability is in the low 5%, about 10 basis points below where we were last year. So, those are numbers we're comfortable with, taking on slightly lower occupancy. Availability is about right as we start to push rents harder going into the spring season.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for the color. And then in terms of supply in urban versus suburban, the presentation shows suburban supply decreasing in 2017 against urban. But the commentary from the other apartment peers that have reported earnings so far is focused on supply moving out of the urban core more back into the suburbs. So, I'm wondering, if you expect that to occur after 2017 or if you think supply will continue to impact the urban core more so at this point in the cycle?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Nick, this is Tim. The slide that we show, I guess it's Slide 7. To be clear, that really is focused on deliveries as we get out to 2016 and 2017. Our peers may have been, I didn't listen to their calls, they may have been focused more on starts, which obviously would impact maybe 2018, 2019. And as I mentioned before, I mean it's not, we're relatively agnostic between urban and suburban. And in terms of just even how we're focusing our efforts, if we start to see more value in the urban submarkets, we're going to, because of some of the trends we're seeing now, we're likely to maybe double back there. So, they may be right. You might see some fall off in 2018 or 2019 if starts in 2016 or 2017 come down in the urban areas, but certainly in terms of deliveries, we don't see that at all over the next couple of years.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Nick, just to give you some specific numbers based on our sort of ground up view of supply, which is a blend of the development team and our operations team and our market research team working together both with their own knowledge, as well as third party information. Those numbers in 2016 are about 2.8% of inventory in the urban submarkets. In terms of deliveries, at about 1.9% in suburban. And the projections for 2017 based on pretty much what we know right now, shovels in the ground et cetera. So, it could move around a little bit, but given the timeline, get things entitled and built probably it's not going to move a lot. Some stuff may be delayed from one year to the next but, in aggregate, probably not going to move a lot.","For 2017, deliveries in the urban submarkets around 3% and suburban about 1.4%. So, that's based on what we know today. The other thing that's out there we probably need to be mindful of just in terms of total supply is there are some things happening both from a hard cost perspective, as well as the construction lending environment that may constrain that a little bit just universally. So, that's something to keep in mind.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Jana Galan with Bank of America.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I thought the public private partnership development right added in this quarter looks very unique. Is that something that you're going to look to do more of in the future?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Hi, Jana, it's Matt. I guess I'll speak to that one. It has been part of our business for a long time and we've had a lot of success with public private partnerships at certain points in the cycle, including in New York we had some very successful deals, in Queens, in Long Island City. Last decade it were so much similar, we've done some public private deals on the West Coast and some transit stations.","So, it does play well to our competitive advantages we think into some of our strengths and that deal is actually a good example because we were able to be selective there as a developer, even though others may have offered a higher land value because the public authority recognized and respected that given our reputation, given our scale, our balance sheet strength everything else, that we can deliver on our promises and for them it's as much about certainty of execution.","There are some schools to be built there on that side as well as the project we would own and by dealing with \u2013 and selecting us, they don't have to deal with a private developer who is going to have a separate equity partner, separate lender, separate general contractor, it's an integrated solution. So, we have \u2013 we like those deals. That particular deal, it's a pretty exciting location, 96 Street and 2 Avenue, it's a full city block, it's right on top of the new 2 Avenue subway line, which is I think the first new line in the city in many, many, many years. And the timing on that one is such that given the approvals process that's in front of us, the regulatory process, that deal actually may well start kind of early into the next cycle, which is based on some of the slides that Tim had shown before frequently deals that have very strong returns.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And is there any updates for your upper west side New York development in terms of a retail component?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jana, this is Tim. I think you are referring to the Columbus Circle site that we own. Currently, we actually are doing some work on the site. We are doing some enabling work in terms of abatement and demolition. I think as we mentioned before, we still anticipate starting the deal sometime mid this year, probably sometime in Q3 \u2013 late Q3. We are continuing to evaluate different strategies to lay off some risk there, including one way that you mentioned, by bringing in a retail partner. We still have people interested despite some softness on the condo side. So, people are interested in wholesaling some of the building for residential condo as well.","The reality is, we've been spending time, really trying to nail down performance obligations for both types and it's ultimately got to work. Ultimately for there to be a deal because to the extent we bring in a retail partner, they would essentially be taking title at the time of which we can deliver a cold dark shell to them. And we want to make sure they're going to be there and they're going to ought to make sure that we can meet certain performance obligations, and until in effect we're almost ready to start the building, the vertical building construction, we're not going to really be in a position to finalize the deal there.","Another strategy, I mean impart given the East 96 street site, we are considering essentially to bring in a financial partner, to layoff some, as another way to layoff some risk. The deal that Matt just talked about, it's a large deal, which is $500 million excluding the land lease itself. And so, as we think about New York City concentration, we may look at either joint venture in Columbus Circle, or potentially even other avenues to lay-off some of the concentration risk in a pretty short investment time period in the city.","So, just stay tuned, we're exploring a number of sort of risk management strategies with respect to this deal and our overall portfolio there. And we'll keep people informed as it makes most sense.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah, thanks. Following up on New York, you sighted supply as one of the reasons for softness in the market. I was wondering if you could also comment on what you're seeing on the demand side?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, sure, Gaurav, this is Sean. When you think about New York, for the most part, we do think it is a supply issue. It's about \u2013 our expectation for this year is about 2% of inventory, but in New York City proper, it's about 3.5% direct supply. And then if you toss in some shadow supplier from condos and things like that, that number might be a little bit higher.","On the demand side, demand has actually been pretty healthy. Job growth has been steady across the region in I think mid 1% range and it's been up in the mid 2%s in terms of the city itself. So, demand has been there, but what you have to keep in mind related to the supply is, it's all coming in at the pretty high end for the most part and if you think about New York City and even parts of Northern New Jersey, what's going to be delivered this year is about 10,000 units. So, there is plenty of demand. The demand might not look the same as what it has on last cycles in terms of percentage from the financial sector, a very, very high paying levels. So, there is probably more diversity of the job growth than what we have experienced in the past. But there has been steady absorption and steady demand in that market.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Great. And then following up on suburban versus urban that chart number, slide number seven that you have in your presentation, suburban outperforming urban. But if I look at your New York suburban portfolio, by rental it's just underperforming the urban market. So I was wondering if you could provide more details as to what's going on in New York suburban?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So, in terms of New York, one thing to keep in mind there is the suburban sub markets in the Northeast in general, including New York and then moving up into New England are more seasonal. So, you tend to see more softness and like Q4 or Q1 in the suburban submarkets. So, that's not a surprise to us in terms of where we ended the first quarter, as well as the fourth quarter. But as you look forward and the impact on supply, to give you a sense of where it's headed, for our portfolio if you look at renewal offers as we move in through the second quarter, they are in the low 5% range, the weakest is New York City at about 4%, the Long Island is at 6%, Northern New Jersey is at 7%, Central New Jersey at 5.5%. So, we do expect those suburban submarkets to pick up steam as we move through the second quarter and third quarter relative to New York City, purely just as a function of supply for the most part. So, we expect it will play out that way in New York overall based on what we know today.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure.","Operator","We'll go next to Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just sticking with New York a little bit, could you provide a little bit of color on what you're seeing at your AVA DoBro project in terms of lease up pace relative to the expectations, as well as the rents you're achieving there?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. It's Sean again. Yeah, lease up volume has been quite good there. We averaged 39 a month through the quarter, which is quite healthy considering it tends to be one of the lower volume quarters of the year. It typically ramps up in the second quarter and the third quarter. There is some supply being delivered in that submarket now. There will be a little bit more as we get further into the year. The velocity and rate have both been quite healthy. So, rate is holding a little bit above what we expected around $60 a foot and velocity has been good. So, our expectation is for that to continue. The DoBro product is a pretty unique product. It's been accepted quite well by the target demographic, and so we are pleased with the early results.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Austin, this is Matt. Just to clarify a little bit, we have marked the AVA DoBro piece of that to market and that's the number that you see updated in the earnings release, because the Avalon piece, which is the upper floors of the building, we have not yet started to lease there. Those rents are not yet mark-to-market.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And what percent of the units there are the AVA DoBro?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","I think it is about 300 Avalon and 500 AVA.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, so 500. 60% or so is the AVA.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just more sticking on the New York City submarket specifically. Despite the supply during sort of the typically slower season, occupancy was up 50 basis points during the quarter. And I was just curious what was driving that, if it was tactical and just some detail there?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I mean as you might know from previous commentary for us, we don't necessarily target a very specific rate of occupancy for each and every market and submarket. Our objective is to optimize revenue and so sometimes we are going to get back occupancy to get rate and\/or vice versa to try and optimize revenues. So I wouldn't read too much into occupancy changes from quarter-to-quarter or even year-over-year. The only global statement I would say is over the last couple of years given market conditions, we're more aggressive on rate, all things being equal at the expense of occupancy across our footprint and every submarket is little bit different, but I wouldn't read too much into the sequential quarter even the year-over-year numbers other than the trend of last couple of years being more aggressive on the rate side and yielding a little bit more on occupancy has been okay.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. That's helpful. And then just switching and last one from me to the portfolio management comments. I guess what are you guys really trying to accomplish as you see acquisitions come to market and where exactly are you seeing the best opportunities?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Maybe I'll start and then ask Matt to follow-up in terms of where we're seeing the best opportunities. There is just a lot of transaction volume right now, and there is a lot of really, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a lot of really fine assets often times built by, merchant builders, coming off construction loans, they don't have permanent loans in place that have the prepayment penalties and therefore, sometimes sort of \u2013 that doesn't make it attractive for us in terms of assuming secured debt.","So, it's an opportunity to take advantage. In fact, we have a lot of unencumbered assets, some of which are non-core that we like to trade and there is a point in time in which there is some really attractive assets that we think we can improve the overall quality of the portfolio by churning a little bit of it. So, it's a little bit of a unique moment in time we think, but in terms of \u2013 Matt in terms of where we're seeing some of the best opportunities, maybe you can just elaborate a little bit there.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Sure. I guess I'd start by saying on the macro level regionally, the two regions where we would seek to redeploy capital the most would be the Mid Atlantic and Southern California for different reasons, but those were actually kind of more or less on target for our long-term portfolio, geographic allocation goals, but if we're under allocated anywhere it's probably in those two regions. And some of that was frankly delivered. In the case of Mid Atlantic we sold quite a bit here, earlier in the cycle kind of in front of what we saw lot of supply coming relative to the Mid Atlantic's history.","So, we think it's a pretty good time to be buying in the Mid Atlantic. Values haven't increased all that much relative to all the other geographies in our portfolio which makes sense because obviously rents have been relatively flat here for quite a while. So, we see just better value in terms of just total relative to replacement cost, relative to cost, preferred cost per unit. And Southern Cal, it's always difficult there. Archstone really was a transformative event for us in terms of growing our Southern California portfolio, but we're still looking to grow there where we can.","In terms of submarket locations, we are looking to upgrade the quality of the portfolio a little bit as Tim mentioned. So you look at the three that we've mentioned so far, they're all infill, high-quality, high-density infill suburbs, we would look in, in the urban cores as well based on pricing, where we see the best relative value, but higher walk scores.","And then we have been looking at younger assets, which is a little different for us. We do find, sometimes, we're a very successful buyer for assets that maybe somebody else has just renovated, 12 year, 15 year old assets where the value-add players aren't going to bid those up to the same extent. So we look at those types of assets too, and arguably the Market Common fits that description a little bit. But we're always looking for ways where if we can leverage what advantages we have into, sometimes, it's unique deal structure that may drive us to get a little bit better value on the buy side. But typically we would probably be looking for assets that are a little bit younger than what you may have seen us buying in the past. And again...","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for all the detail.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeffrey Pehl with Goldman Sachs.","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thank you. Just looking back at the Archstone acquisition in late 2012, the largest component of the purchase was in Southern California. How do you believe those assets are performing today versus your original expectations?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Jeff, it's Sean Breslin. In terms of overall performance, I think it's fair to say that the assets have outperformed our expectations in terms of our period of ownership here. And then on top of that, the other thing I would add is there's probably more opportunity in the portfolio in terms of redevelopment, repositioning those assets than we probably expected going in. Archstone did a fine job maintaining the assets, but given the balance sheet they had and the position they were tied into with Lehman just didn't necessarily have the capital to invest in the assets to reposition them.","So we're trying to take advantage of that opportunity across the footprint, including significant concentration that we did acquire in Southern California. So net-net, I'd say we're pleased with our results from Archstone and values have grown considerably during the last couple of years.","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, thanks for the color. And just as a follow-up to that, do you believe your Southern California portfolio could potentially outperform Northern California over the next few years?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, it's Sean again, I mean, it's always a possibility given the underlying demand drivers in Southern California combined with the very low levels of supply, the lowest of any of our regions currently in terms of our expectation, sort of in the mid-1% range. It's a possibility. It tends to be a market that, over the long run, has been an outperformer with far less volatility than some of the tech markets like Northern California and Seattle. So it could certainly be a period of time where it does outperform, that would not be beyond reason.","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the color.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure.","Operator","We'll go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good afternoon. Just first, you mentioned in some prior questions ago about the bank regulation on lending. As you guys have seen it so far in the banks be impacted by the Basel III coming down on construction lending, has your experience, what you've seen in the field, has there been a material cutback on the part of developers and their inability to get construction lending or is this really sort of an issue on the edges and most developers that you see in the market are still able to get the construction lending as they historically have been able to?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Alex, this is Sean, and maybe Tim or Matt want to jump in. I mean at this point, we're aware of what's been communicated to the banks, and some of the risk retention issues as well as the incremental oversight of multifamily loans. For the most part, what we're hearing is somewhat anecdotal in terms of more pressure on the underwriting, banks putting out targets that are, I'd say, either even or less than volume they produced last year in terms of construction lending for multifamily specifically. So I'd say it's still early in the game as to the eventual outcome, but there are certain signs of tightening that will put more pressure on bringing either additional equity to the table to get deals done probably is the likely answer, but different pricing as well. And Kevin, may want to comment on that as well from a bank perspective.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Alex, I mean as you know, we're not directly in the market, but from what we've been able to learn from being active in our dialogue with the banks who do this kind of construction financing, certainly what we have heard is that construction financing has become tougher to obtain as you point out, especially for small, less well capitalized developers. Pricing, for example, has moved beyond 300 bps over LIBOR. And in order to get better terms, often these developers are needing to provide partial recourse and sometimes making commitments to provide permanent financing to the bank post construction, and sometimes provide higher levels of deposit. So across the board, there's just been a little bit of tightening that we've seen in the end market.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Alex, just maybe the last point on this. I think the way it sort of initially manifests itself, you to start to see a little more deal flow on the land side. So as private sponsors are maybe not getting the terms or hearing what they want to hear from banks or even potentially equity partners, those deals oftentimes start to get sort of softly marketed back in the market. And we're seeing that right now on a couple of particularly attractive opportunities, where the land owner thought that they were going to develop them themselves and suddenly they're spinning a different story to the market that they've got a lot on their plate and they need to sell some of what they got. So I think it's a way you're likely to see it manifest itself at least initially here over the next three months to six months. But I think we'll probably just all kind of have to keep a watch out and see is it really having an impact at the end of the day on total start volume.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","But the point is that you guys are likely to see some more attractively priced land?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we'll see more traffic in land initially. We'll see ultimately what it brings in terms of...","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","... (36:45) But...","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","On the condo side, on the Sheepshead Bay project, where you have a condo partner in there, just given all the up-talk about condo concern in New York, as far as the financial risk to AvalonBay, if the entity doesn't perform, I assume you guys just automatically take over their spot or is there some financial liability to you if they run into some financial difficulty on their own?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Alex, this is Matt. I guess I can take a shot at that one and, I don't know, if Kevin wants to chime in as well. They have equity in the deal. We are providing construction financing really to facilitate the deal because we're building the whole building. And so if they were to default on the loan, they would walk away from their equity and we would wind up with their units. I believe there is some guarantee support as well, although I don't remember exactly how deep that goes. And we have looked at that as a downside scenario. We could take their units back and rent them, and we don't think it would be a material change to the economics of that deal.","I will also say that it's a very different location. You talk about there's a lot of condo supply in New York, it's not in Sheepshead Bay, it's not in Brighton Beach, it's not in that part of Brooklyn at all. So that market is its own little micro pocket there that I really think is hardly at all impacted by what's going on across the city.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then just final question. The $0.14 land gain in the second quarter, what's that relate to?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Alex, this is Kevin. That relates to a second phase of development that we anticipate contributing to a venture with our existing partners, and in doing so recognize a gain on that sale of the land to that venture of about $20 million.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay, cool. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Sean, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your various D.C. submarkets performance-wise, stronger versus weaker and what's likely to be the trend over the remainder of the year as leasings continue?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Sure, Rob, happy to. In terms of the Mid-Atlantic, based on where we are to date in terms of performance, and I'll talk mainly from a rent change perspective in terms of where we're getting traction, D.C. is actually holding up the best right at the moment, kind of mid 2% range versus a 1.5% or so for suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia. That's up roughly about 75 basis points over last year. I mean our expectation going forward is that it's probably going to continue to be the softest in the suburban Maryland submarket based on the supply that's being delivered across Rockville, North Bethesda et cetera. Northern Virginia probably will be sort of the second position, if you want to call it, in terms of performance. And then D.C., based on asset mix that we have, we think will probably be the leading submarket in terms of performance. And keep in mind, what's in our same-store bucket is Northwest, some value-oriented assets, a deal tied to American University et cetera. So it's a very different kind of same-store basket relative to maybe others. The majority of the supply is actually going to be delivered in the District. So if you looked at it from an entire market perspective, D.C. probably will continue to be soft and potentially as soft as suburban Maryland. But in terms of our specific portfolio and the way it's positioned, the D.C. assets are leading and probably will continue to.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And then did you guys see any weakness during the quarter in your highest price point units, the sort of super-luxury or whatever you want to call it, the $6,000, $8,000, $10,000 plus price point units and stuff like that?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Any particular market in mind or just in general you mean?","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Well, I mean, I would guess New York and San Francisco would be the two that I would most target, but I guess across the portfolio as well.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't say so. I mean, if I think about it like from a New York perspective, the highest rent deal we have is in the Bowery at $80 a foot or so, and it's been performing quite well. There's very little supply there to compete against. So I think for the most part, it really does depend on where your assets are positioned relative to new supplies. So we've got $50-a-foot, $60-a-foot assets in Midtown West, more value oriented, but there's more supply there, so they're struggling more, as an example. But then you go to Long Island City and it's $50 a foot, $55 a foot, and it's doing 6% year-over-year. And so I wouldn't say there is a common thread to higher end units underperforming across any of the markets at this point in time. It's really more a direct function of to supply in the submarket that you're in.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. So nothing even with like bifurcation between sort of penthouse and mid-tier sort of units within the same complex or anything like that?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Not necessarily, no. I mean Exeter at the Pru gets the highest rents, but at the high end floors. So I would say there's nothing that we see materially at this point. It'd be sort of one-off type things.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Richard Charles Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Question on New York. Can you make any comment about how things trended over the course of the quarter? Did you notice anything improving as the quarter went on? Was March better than January or was nothing discernible there in terms of trend line?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I mean, Rich, this is Sean, it's certainly picking up steam a little bit. I mean if you look at the region overall, rent change in the first quarter was about 2%, which was 1% New York City, about 4% in Long Island and 2.5% to 3.5% in the Jersey markets. It has picked up steam a little bit, where we're doing around 3% now instead of 2%, which is around low 4%s in renewals and 1%,1.5% on move-ins. But as I mentioned earlier, when you look at renewals, I'd say it has started to pick up a little more speed, particularly in the suburban submarkets, as I mentioned New York City is still the weakest around 4%, but it moves up quite nicely when you get into the suburban submarkets, 5.5%, 6%, 7% depending on where you are. So I'd say the momentum is positive, probably most positive in the suburban submarkets as compared to the city.","Richard Charles Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay, great. And then on your dispositions, do you have any tax protection issues that may be behind some of the motivation to also be an acquirer?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Rich, this is Matt. Yeah, no, we are planning on doing some of our disposition acquisition activity as 1031 Exchanges, but I wouldn't say that we have tax protection issues beyond the fact that we can only sell so much without redeploying the proceeds into acquisitions or paying a special dividend. So I mean we have an overall company limit on that volume, but...","Richard Charles Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","...I don't know, Kevin if you...","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Rich. This is Kevin, to add on that, I mean we tend, as you know, to use dispositions as a means of funding development activity. And that certainly is our plan this year, that component of our external capital that we raise to fund development will be in the form of dispositions. At some level beyond a certain point when we sell additional assets and trigger additional gains, and you can see some very robust gains here reflected in what we've sold so far, you do run into a situation where from a re-tax point of view you would need to make a special distribution and would retain that capital. So if we want to buy assets to reposition the portfolio and fund that with dispositions beyond what we would need to sell to fund the development, then at some point it just makes sense to do that incremental portfolio repositioning through 1031 activity.","Richard Charles Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Right. I was talking about that, but also individuals that may own units and exposed to a gain.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","No. We've picked up a little tax protection, our share of that in connection with the Archstone transaction, but that's not implicated in anything we're discussing right now.","Richard Charles Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And what about \u2013 just what kind of spread you're seeing inbound, outbound cap rates and to what degree is that maybe contributing to some incremental dilution in the near-term? Clearly you're looking to create value long-term, but is that something you can comment on?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yes. It's been a pretty tight spread, this is Matt again. The sales, as of last quarter, we sold (46:16) in Connecticut at a low 5%s cap and the buys were in the high 4%s. So there's maybe a little bit of dilution there, but it's relatively small. And from a timing point of view, we're doing suddenly these reverse exchanges where we're actually buying in front of the selling. So I don't think it's material.","Richard Charles Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","How far in advance can you do that? What's the rule?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","I think six months.","Richard Charles Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question form Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman Partners LLC","Good afternoon. Great results, guys. Thank you for taking my question. As it relates to your portfolio and your concentration is more suburban as well as Class B, and you think about the inventories, how tight they are for resale and the benefit that your tenants may not be able to find something even if they want to move out or afford it or get mortgage financing and some of the challenges, how do you think about, going forward, some of the dynamics that incrementally on the for-sale side that might loosen up or more inventory will come? And in which markets are you arguably the most vulnerable or may see more pressure for move-out to buy within your footprint? Just first question, and then I have a couple more to follow up. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Ivy, just a general commentary on that trend maybe, I means move-outs to home purchase has remained well below historical averages for essentially this entire cycle. It is only 11% this quarter as an example, which is down about 150 basis points year-over-year. And typically where we're probably most sensitive to it in terms of either existing assets or new opportunities is in those markets where home prices are somewhat more affordable, which would typically be Seattle and the Mid-Atlantic, maybe a little bit in Central Jersey. And based on everything that we see, production is certainly starting to increase some, but it remains well below just sort of structural demand given the level of household formations that are expected, which you know quite better than all of us. So in terms of near-term pressure, I don't think that's likely to be a real issue for us based on what we know today.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman Partners LLC","Got it. Thank you for that. There is not a particular market that stands out as one, I mean certainly a market like Queens or New Jersey, those markets, nothing stands out incrementally within the portfolio, the 11% is pretty consistent across the board in terms of the move out to buy?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","No, it does move around by market. As I mentioned, those two markets, Mid-Atlantic and Seattle and then New England tend to be at the higher end of the range, as compared to New York, Southern Cal, Northern Cal, very expensive markets, tends to be quite low. The only market that basically was at its long-term average at one point last year was New England, which was about 20%, 21%. It's drifted down since that time. So at this point, every market is running well below its long-term average.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman Partners LLC","Got it. And if I may ask one more follow-up as it relates to supply in the markets where you seem to be better positioned that you're not in, the New York sort of tougher areas where all the supply is being delivered. What historically has the trickle-down effect been into Class B assets where you're seeing rents under pressure, or more concessions being offered in Class A? Can you go back historically and look at what the impact has been, if any, in the Class B suburban or within the urban Class B?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ivy, this is Tim. Certainly, whenever there's any supply introduced into a market, it's going to have some impact on all rental housing. And I sort of think of it as sort of concentric circles, if you will. So, the stuff that's newer, more recently delivered is kind of right in bull's eye? And as you kind of go down the price, the price ladder, they're obviously less impacted. And you'll \u2013 I mean, I think right now in our portfolio we're seeing \u2013 just to give you an example, I think we're seeing Class B roughly outperforming Class A by over 100 basis points, 150 basis points in terms of rent growth. So, it's probably more significant even in the sub markets that are experiencing a lot of supply.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman Partners LLC","Got it. Well, thank you. Good luck, guys. I appreciate you taking the question.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird & Company.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. I was hoping to take the discussion of the Bay area, a little deeper and talk about specific towns, specific areas on whether it'd be urban versus suburban, Class A versus Class B, and can you talk about which areas are most impacted by new supply, and which are most impacted by any marginal slackening of demand?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, sure, Drew, this is Sean. First, maybe to set some context for Northern California, when we provided guidance earlier this year, and Tim alluded to it on today's prepared remarks you know for the call as well, we did have an expectation that given the increase in supply across the region, which is basically around 3% today as compared to 1.5% last year, combined with a somewhat softening in demand. If you remember, at this point last year job growth across the Bay Area was running around 4% at a pretty blistering pace, as compared to about 2% today that we would see softening in performance throughout the year and that's pretty much on track, as I mentioned earlier. We are basically on budget in that market.","In terms of the performance of the specific submarkets where you are seeing stronger and weaker results what I would say is, in general, more value-oriented assets are outperforming the higher-end assets across the footprint, the footprint being the Bay Area region overall.","In terms of specific submarkets, San Francisco, that supply is pretty much Mission Bay kind of the submarket right there that tends to be a little bit weaker right now.","Our assets, the value-oriented assets, Daly City, Pacifica, (52:43) they're all outperforming versus the higher end A assets Mission Bay and SoMa is underperforming. San Jose, the supply is North East San Jose a little bit of South San Jose and then it stretches up really into Mountain View as well in terms of supply. And then, on East Bay, there is not a whole lot of supply really in the East Bay. You have a little bit in Dublin and Pleasanton, it's a product coming online up towards Public Market (53:10), Berkeley in that area, but it's de minimis relative to what you're seeing in San Francisco and San Jose. So, hopefully that provides some context where the supply is coming online.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's helpful. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I did join the call a little late. So, I apologize, but at any point have you addressed updated guidance for 2016 given first quarter results and your initial take on what 2Q could look like?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Sure Tayo, this is Kevin. As you may recall, we historically do not provide updated guidance for the full year on our first quarter call. We provide some initial outlook obviously for our fourth quarter call in January, and then we provide a fulsome mid-year update after our \u2013 in connection with our second quarter call, so that's the plan. So, we don't have a further update particularly given that we've got the leasing season in front of us and we're only a few months from having done a full budget. So, no new news on that front.","This was the first quarter that we provided guidance on the second quarter. As you can see from our release, the midpoint of our guidance for NAREIT FFO is $2.10 per share, and our core FFO is $2 per share. So, that's \u2013 and then in terms of what we did in the first quarter as you know from our release, we beat our initial expectation by $0.06, which is probably the largest beat on our expectations in the quarterly basis in recent memory. So, quite strong performance with about probably $0.04 of that $0.06 beat likely to be permanent, and $0.02 likely to reverse at some point over the course of the year.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's all very helpful.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Is that helpful, Tayo?","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Thanks helpful color. Thank you.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","All right.","Operator","And we'll go next to Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Good afternoon. What is your total expected disposition volume this year to fund development beyond what you're going to use for asset purchases?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","So, Conor, this is Kevin. I guess essentially what you are asking for is what's our net disposition activity. We don't provide that level of guidance because essentially that would be, as you recall, when we provided our outlook for 2016, we indicated that we anticipated sourcing external capital of about $1.1 billion.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Yes.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","And at the time, we indicated that that would likely come through unsecured debt and asset sales with unsecured debt hopefully and likely comprising the majority of that $1.1 billion. So really, it's the $1.1 billion less whatever we do in unsecured debt that would represent the net disposition activity. But it certainly represents a minority of that $1.1 billion.","In terms of what we've done so far, as you can see, essentially, the acquisitions that we completed in the first quarter were basically funded through fund and wholly-owned asset sales and the assumed debt in Hoboken. So, going forward for the balance of the year, we expect to source still about $1.1 billion. And again, the expectation is predominantly in the form of unsecured debt with the balance through net disposition activity.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Thank you. And then, on East 96th, is this indicative of a more competitive land environment, having to doing a deal like this?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Hey, Conor. It's Matt. Actually, we've been working on that deal for three years already. So I would say, it's indicative in the sense that we've said for a while now that doing straight up land deals in New York is very, very difficult at today's economics. So, if we were to source new opportunities, it would more likely be deals like this. But I wouldn't say that \u2013 we are generally in the market for these types of opportunities, they are infrequent and they are complex and they tend to take a lot of time to get done. But there are opportunities that we sought throughout different points in the cycle over the years.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","And given the lengthy process both getting to this point and then to actually getting the project started, could you walk away from this deal in two years if after the approval process rents have moved or in the same way that you option other pieces of land and you have the ability to walk away, could you walk away from this deal?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","I don't want to get into too much of the specifics. There is still a lot to be resolved, but suffice it to say that there are a lot \u2013 there is a fair amount of flexibility on all sides.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay. And will there be an affordable component on the units?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. This is mixed income deal, it is not subject \u2013 there is no 421-a program in New York today, but because it's a public-private deal, essentially we'll be doing a private or synthetic 421-a and that's part of the negotiations and the discussions we're having with the ECS in terms of the levels, the amount, the debt, the subsidy and so on. So, more to come.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay. Then just last one. What level of capital is at risk on this deal currently?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. It's pretty de minimis at this current point in time.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's legal fees and a little bit of planning at this point in time, it's not much.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Greg Van Winkle with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory A. Van Winkle - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. You just mentioned that $0.02 of a beat in 1Q 2016 is likely to reverse over the course of the year. Can you just elaborate on what you meant by that. Is that because you've got lower expectation for New York and San Fran over the balance of the year? Just help me understand that comment?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Greg, this is Kevin. To be clear, we're not providing guidance through that set of comments. So, I was just confirming that of the $0.06 that we beat our initial expectations in the first quarter, $0.04 likely appears to be permanent and $0.02 is likely to reverse in the balance of the year. So, to give you an example of that, we received kind of a $0.01 positive variance in the first quarter from a tax rebate that we received in March that we had budgeted to receive in April. So, that $0.01 will reverse in the current month. So, that's an example of it.","The other $0.01 was related to redevelopment OpEx, which was largely due to slight delays in start of some renovation programs that we still expect to start. So, that will probably reverse ratably over the course of the next three quarters.","Gregory A. Van Winkle - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I see. Thanks for clearing that up. And then you talked about seeing some acquisition opportunities right now and that the big driver of that is there's a lot of quantity of deals coming to market. I'm curious also if you're seeing any change in the kind of pricing or private capital is willing to pay or how many bids that are out there?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","This is Matt. I guess I'll speak to that one a little bit. I would say not yet, we are also marketing a fair number of assets, as well as in the hunt on buying assets. So, generally speaking, there is still a lot of interest, a lot of activity. Again, on the buy-side, we see a slight wrinkle in one deal that may draw less interest than others because of some profile of the deal or structure that \u2013 we view that as a little bit of an opportunity and in some cases that has worked to our advantage. But generally speaking, there might be a little bit less interest in some deals if they are kind of tertiary submarket locations, but broadly speaking there's still a lot of demand, a lot of people looking to buy property right now.","Gregory A. Van Winkle - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then, last one here. I'm just curious on what you are seeing in terms of rent to income ratios in your portfolio relative to what those look like historically and just how much of a concern pure price fatigue is becoming or if you're seeing any kind of meaningful uptick already and move out to the rent in any of your markets?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Greg, it's Sean. Rent to income ratios, they are still running around 22%. It's been away for couple of years now and it's at the higher end of the range from an historical perspective, but has remained relatively constant. So one thing we have said is that, we continue to expect wage growth to help support rent growth going forward, and we've seen that so far beating last year in particular and our expectation for this year. So overall I think we're in a pretty good shape. In terms of move outs to the rent increases, it's down about a 100 basis points last year, submarkets were down more than others, but in general, we're comfortable with where we are.","Gregory A. Van Winkle - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah.","Operator","We'll go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hello, guys. A quick question on what you're seeing as far as traffic goes. We had a difficult start to the year with the equity markets, a lot of volatility, a lot of recession periods. I imagine some companies might have been holding back on their hiring decisions, things look a little bit better now. Don't know if you've seen an uptick in traffic, maybe a leading indicator of incremental hiring. What are you seeing at the ground level?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Wes, this is Sean. First, in terms of commentary about traffic, one thing to be cautious about on traffic is we start to influence that number as well, depending on our level of availability we may be driving marketing harder or softer to generate traffic. So, it is a bit of a manufactured number in terms of \u2013 it's based on not only organic demand, but how much of that demand we're trying to capture.","In terms of overall traffic, though it was up about 3% as I recall year-over-year in the first quarter. And if you looked at it, per available apartment home, I think it was down about a 100 basis points. So, not a significant movement one way or another and I would just be careful, about how are you thinking about using that information that's all.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And there's no I guess big difference in seasonality between the months of January, February, or March probably, but it sounds like you don't even want to use that number. Looking at the development pipeline, how much of that pipeline consists of the complex deals where maybe Avalon and maybe a few others can compete and take on a deal like the one you did on 96th East versus just a plain vanilla development?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Listen, this is Matt. I guess, in terms of \u2013 I think a lot of them are deals that probably are more well suited to our competitive advantages than others, not necessarily because of the complexity. A lot of those are deals in New Jersey, where we have an ability to crack entitlement that a lot of others don't for example. So, they all have a different story. Therefore, in suburban Boston too where we have an incredibly deep franchise that has been doing that for years. So, a lot of them are those types of deals. We do have a couple of deals, which are mixed used deals in our pipeline, including one that we expect to start here later this year in Northern California and Emeryville, which also we think plays to our strength \u2013 not just similar to the deal we did with Eden here in Northern Virginia, Mosaic or Assembly Row up in Boston which we did with Federal. So, we have a few deals like that in the pipeline, but it's really, it's pretty diverse, it's diverse by region, it's diverse by deal type. They all have different reasons why kind of from an economic point of view we thought that we have some kind of an advantage there.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","And with no further questions in queue, I'd like to turn the call back to Tim Naughton for any closing remarks.","Timothy J.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Jason Reilley, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin.","Jason Reilley","Thank you, Keith, and welcome to Avalonbay Communities' Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during the discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially.","There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release, as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating performance and financial results.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of Avalonbay Communities, for his remarks.","Timothy J. Naughton","Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our second quarter call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. The format for the call today will be the same as the last 2 quarters. We posted a management letter and slide deck this morning on our website before the market opened. I'll be providing management commentary on the slides, then all of us will be available for Q&A afterward.","My comments will focus on providing a high-level summary of the quarter's results, as well as our updated annual outlook. I'll also touch on some of the key economic and apartment market factors that are impacting performance and our outlook, including recent trends in portfolio performance. And lastly, I'll just touch on development activity, performance and funding.","So let's go ahead and get started, starting on Slide 4 of the deck. Generally, performance remains in line with our business plan. In Q2, FFO growth was up around 10%. Core FFO growth was up around 5% after adjusting for nonroutine items. Same-store revenue growth was up 3.1% on a year-over-year basis and 150 basis points sequentially. If you would include redevelopment, it would be up about -- it would be up 3.3% and 160 basis points sequentially. And then on a year-to-date basis, on a year-over-year basis with a different basket, which is just the AvalonBay legacy assets, same-store revenue would be up -- it was up 3.7%, and 4.1% if you were to include redevelopment.","Development completions this quarter totaled almost $200 million, with an initial projected yield of 7.3%. And we started another $400 million and 4 deals, all of which were in California. We were also active in the capital market this past quarter, having raised $440 million through a variety of sources, including the CEP.","Now let's talk about the updated outlook for 2014, moving on to Slide 5. Our updated outlook is largely unchanged from our initial outlook that we issued at the beginning of the year. FFO growth has increased, but most of that is attributable to the projected Christie Place promote, which, once that closes, we'll be disclosing more detail around. That doesn't include all of our distribution from the Christie Place sale. The rest of the distribution is embedded in the gain on the revised EPS guidance, which is on our -- which represents gain on our $6 million equity investment and net asset.","Core FFO growth is projected to increase by 40 basis points over our original outlook from 8.7% to 9.1%, and same-store revenue and NOI growth are largely in line with our original outlook, with some minor adjustments. And similarly, development starts and funding needs are largely unchanged at right around or just under $1.5 billion for the year.","So now let's discuss some of the key economic assumptions that drive our performance and supporting our outlook. Starting with the consumer, the economy is improving and the consumer is definitely on the mend after a slow Q1. Consumer confidence is recovering, as shown in that upper left-hand slide, driven by a number of factors, including healthier balance sheets, as debt and financial obligations are at a generational low; an improving wage picture, with weekly earnings up quite a bit over the last few quarters; and a better opportunity set, with job openings up back to pre-downturn levels.","Moving to Slide 7. Importantly, jobs are going to those with higher rental propensity profiles, specifically young adults, which account for about half of net jobs created over the last 6 quarters, which, we think, explains, in part, the modest housing recovery, where homeownership rates are still more than 400 basis points below peak but more than 700 basis points lower for young adults from peak. So really, it's a combination of demographics, living preferences and purchase behavior that's all favoring rental housing today. And the overall apartment demand is benefiting from the improved economy, growing confidence and demographics.","Let's turn to the supply side of the picture for a couple of minutes. We are seeing deliveries trend up as expected, as shown on Slide 8. But it is -- but supply is being absorbed relatively easy by healthy markets, at least until this point.","Moving on to Slide 9. And while deliveries are elevated over recent years, supply is projected to peak in 2014 and level off next year at just under 2% of inventory -- or of available stock. Metro D.C., as you can see, will remain challenged, with completions totaling almost 7% of stock during '14 and '15, with only modest job growth projected over this time frame.","Moving to Slide 10. And looking beyond to '16 and after, completions should continue to flatten or taper as the multifamily starts have been flattening out over the last 2 to 3 quarters. The starts data on your left does include condo, seniors and student housing and other products. So it can sometimes mask what's actually happening in the multifamily rental market rate supplies trends, which we are actually projecting to taper off a bit in our markets starting in 2016.","So why are deliveries leveling off? I think the answer is really on the right-hand side of this chart. We do think it's a combination of economics and capital availability. In terms of economics, construction costs are now outpacing rent growth since the trough, which is starting to squeeze yields a bit. And then, as you look at the overall capital picture and availability of equity capital, equity capital is starting to rotate to other sectors and is more or less neutral as it relates to our space. And yes, so overall, we look at this as a pretty disciplined market response to fundamentals where development is rising early in the cycle but begins to level off in line with structural demand mid-cycle.","So let's move on. What does this all mean for our portfolio outlook? As I mentioned before, in general, our overall outlook for the year remains intact, with some regional variation. The West Coast continues to lead the way and even a bit stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year. And the Northeast, a little bit below our initial expectations. The outliers, of course, continue to be Northern California, which is still running strong in the 8% range; and Mid-Atlantic, on the other end, which is flat to slightly down for the year.","But as we know, and I'm moving to Slide 12, it is a cyclical business. Market performance varies, and leadership does rotate over time. And I think Northern California and Mid-Atlantic are perhaps 2 of the best examples of markets that we've been active in for a long time. They're both strong markets, they've outperformed over -- for a long period, in this case, 15 years. But importantly, they don't move together or necessarily in the same way over the course of the cycle, which we think provides healthy diversification and helps smooth our overall growth profile.","And I think this chart is a reminder, as you just looked at sort of the movement over in 5-year increments, that today's underperformers are often tomorrow's outperformers and vice versa. And while we're not sure exactly when these markets will turn, we're just pretty sure that they will. And that leadership will rotate as it has in the past. And in general, we expect most of these markets to deliver 2.5% to 3%, maybe 3.5% growth over an extended period of time.","So turning to Slide 13. As it relates to what we're expecting for the balance of the year, we do expect modest improvement in the second half of the year, with Q2 representing the low-water mark for same-store revenue growth, moving from the low 3% range to mid to high 3% range in the second half, and we actually have already started to see that in June and July, where same-store revenue growth has been in the 3.5% and projected to be close to 4% and -- in July.","And turning to Slide 14, I think you can see why that is, as it's really being driven by what we've been seeing in the portfolio over the last few months as same-unit rent growth has increased every month this year. And in fact, the year-to-date rent change since January has actually grown by 7% for the combined same-store portfolio. This chart is for the AVB legacy, when -- but when you look at the same -- the combined same-store portfolio since January on a sequential basis, that's grown by 7%, which is actually stronger than what we experienced last year in 2013.","Turning to Slide 15. Another trend that is emerging in our markets is the outperformance of the suburban submarkets. It's something we've been projecting, given the concentration of starts and deliveries in our urban submarkets, a trend that should persist for the next couple of years as urban deliveries are expected to deliver more than 2x the rate of suburban submarkets over the next 2.5 years. This is, I think, just another example where our exposure to both urban and suburban submarkets provides just additional diversification over the course of the cycle.","Shifting now to development on Slide 16. Lease-up performance remains very strong, with rents $200 above pro forma and yields up 50 basis points above original expectations. And that's on 100 -- on about $1.5 billion that's currently in lease-up across 17 communities. And performance has not come at the expense of absorption. In fact, absorption has been very strong, running at over 30 units per month per community over the last quarter.","And when you look at this portfolio, along with what we've completed so far this cycle, the total is about $3 billion, which is a meaningful source of NAV and FFO accretion, as yields are averaging over 200 basis points above prevailing cap rates and over 300 basis points over initial cost of capital for capital we've sourced so far this cycle.","Turning now to Slide 17. The financing environment remains very attractive to capitalize this investment. Pricing has improved since the beginning of the year, most notably for equity. Debt and asset sales, obviously, remain very attractive, and particularly relative to historical precedent. And I tell you, we believe we just have a full menu of options in front of us in terms of capitalizing very accretive investments to the development platform.","Slide -- now moving to Slide 18 and the last slide of the deck. We've actually sourced all 3 of these capital markets so far this year, actually being most active in the disposition market as we continue to match-fund development commitments. Year-to-date, we've raised about $750 million, and we have about another $350 million in net proceeds pending on the disposition side, including the sale and the ultimate closing of Christie Place. That leaves remaining to fund about $300 million, and just given our current liquidity and credit metrics, we have plenty of flexibility in terms of how we choose to fund this remaining need.","So in summary, 2014 is shaping up more or less as expected. There -- healthy market -- apartment market conditions continue in -- across most of our footprint. We're experiencing another year of strong growth, driven by the stabilized and lease-up portfolios. And we have the ample liquidity, balance sheet capacity and the talent to support continued value-added growth this cycle from, really, what's an incredibly attractive development pipeline of -- representing more than $6 billion in new investment.","And with that, operator, we're ready to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take the first question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Appreciate the updated heat map. Can you talk about the plan to fund the remaining $300 million across these 3 avenues?","Kevin P. O'Shea","Sure. Nick, this is Kevin. As Tim mentioned, we have -- under contract, we are marketing about $350 million of net proceeds that we expect to receive from dispositions. That leaves us about $300 million left to fund. We don't, as a matter of practice, comment with specificity on anticipated capital market or transaction market activity beyond what we've already disclosed in our press release. But I will say that, essentially, when you look at the heat map and you think about our capital alternatives in our principal funding markets that we've tapped over the years, unsecured debt, the transaction market and the common equity markets, they are all open and available to us and attractively priced. And you can probably expect us to think about accessing them over time in a relatively balanced manner, with a focus on maintaining a leverage-neutral balance sheet strategy.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you touch on the current leverage levels compared to the targets that you actually seek?","Kevin P. O'Shea","Sure. Well, there's a couple of metrics that we follow. Probably, first and foremost is net debt-to-EBITDA, which, for the second quarter annualized, was running at about 5.5x. In terms of what we're targeting on that metric, we typically seek to have it range between 5.0x and 6.0x. It's certainly been a little bit lower than that in the past and a little bit higher. So essentially, we're roughly in line with where we are targeting for that metric. Another metric we think about is unencumbered NOI, which is around 59% currently. We'd like to have that right around that level, maybe a little bit higher over time. As you know, we took on more secured debt in connection with the Archstone transaction, which shifted the mix of our debt from about a 50-50 blend of secured and unsecured more to about a 2:1 ratio secured to unsecured immediately following the transaction. We have since moved that ratio back down toward a 50-50 blend, but we're not quite there. And as we continue to shift toward -- our debt portfolio back more toward a 50-50 mix of secured and unsecured, you can expect to see that unencumbered ratio move up over time.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just finally, can you talk more on the New England portfolio? It seems like that's the portfolio, the part of your portfolio that's performing the worst, relative to original expectations.","Sean J. Breslin","Sure, Nick. This is Sean. As it relates to New England, there's really 2 markets there, the Greater Boston area and then Fairfield. Fairfield has certainly been the weaker of the 2 markets, essentially flat revenue growth for Q2. And that's a combination of a couple of factors, one being the pretty meager employment growth that we've seen in that market. I think, for the last 6 months, it's been barely positive, 2,000, 3,000 jobs, as well as some meaningful supply coming into certain submarkets. And I'd highlight Stamford, in particular, where BLT is building on the waterfront and has been building and continues to build there, putting some pressure on supply in that particular submarket. So while the current environment there is somewhat challenged, I would say, over the long term, we've been pretty successful with our development franchise there. So we'll continue to be active. So that's certainly one factor. In terms of Boston, Boston essentially just got a pretty slow start, given the difficult winter, and rental rates really didn't start moving until sometime in the mid of the second quarter. And it's up just barely as you look at it even through June in terms of market rents from probably January 1 through June. So rents have been relatively flat, and occupancy has been down, so that's been a pressure in Boston. You might be thinking it's a result of some of the supplies coming online, and we have experienced a modest impact at the Prudential Center as a result of some of the new supply that's up and leasing in the urban core of Boston, but it's not been material to date in terms of performance. I'd say it's more a reflection of the very slow start to the year.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You mentioned the lease-up assets being 50 basis points ahead of underwriting. Can you just talk about whether there's certain markets where that spread is bigger or smaller than that?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","Sure, Nick. This is Matt. I can speak to that a little bit. It's actually pretty evenly spread. I mean, the place that's probably got the most dramatic outperformance is Northern California. Our AVA 55 Ninth deal, the yield there is north of a 7%, and we underwrote it to a little bit under a 6%, so that's not surprising, given the rent growth that's been going on in Northern California in the 2 years since we started that deal. But it's been -- other than that, it's been relatively consistent across the regions. The other one that I would say has been the biggest outperformer has been the Avalon Exeter, the tower -- the fourth tower, the first new product in the Back Bay there, Prudential Center, where we -- rents just greatly exceeded our initial underwriting, given the lack of really anything to comp it off of in that particular location. There really wasn't anything else that was a true luxury product in the Back Bay of that size and scale.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then maybe you could also talk about land prices, where they are today in, say New York City and San Francisco, obviously being affected, I guess, by condo developers. What do you think that, that does to these markets in the next couple of years as far as maybe preventing some additional apartment supply or even further sort of boosting apartment valuations in these markets?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","Yes, there's no doubt, this is Matt again, that land prices have gotten very heated in New York and San Francisco in particular. And we have not -- it's very tough for us to compete for land sites in the heart of San Francisco and in Manhattan right now. Particularly in Manhattan, pretty much all the land that's trading is trading at condo valuations. So I think you're right that there is a wave of supply coming to Manhattan now. Deals have started in the last year or 2, but it's pretty hard to make rental numbers pencil looking forward right now in that particular location. The other thing you're starting to see is people team up and do rental-condo hybrid buildings. We did buy a piece of land earlier this year in Brooklyn, not in Manhattan, where we are looking to partner in a JV with a for-sale builder, where we would build the building together. We would take the lower piece as rentals. They would the upper piece as condos. That might be one way you see folks provide some more rental product in those locations, but it does make the rental economics more difficult on the land in those urban cores.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I know you're not giving a lot of detail on the Avalon Christie sale. But just to be clear, it sounds like the $0.44 gain that you're talking about is really not the full, I guess, what I'll call economic gain that you intend to receive. Is this really just a piece of it. Is that correct?","Kevin P. O'Shea","Yes, that's correct, Steve.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I just wanted to maybe just follow up on the sequential trends that you're talking about. Obviously, you guys have a kind of ramp going into the back half of the year. I'm just curious, given the notices that you've sent out, presumably, for August, September and maybe even October, how much visibility do you have into that ramp, and what potential risks might there be?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes. Steve, this is Sean. We have pretty good visibility. I'd say a few things. One is, as Tim mentioned in his prepared remarks, we pretty much know where we are for July. It's pretty well baked, given it's July 24, and that's in the high 3% range. We also know where the renewals went out for August and September, which is in the 6.5% to 7% range, which is between 50 to 100 basis points higher than where they went out for June and July. So we have pretty good visibility on where those are trending based on sort of historical capture rates. We also have good visibility in terms of our comps, because it's baked in terms of where occupancy was in the first half of '13 versus the second half of '13, and as opposed to it being a headwind in the first half of '14, it could be a tailwind as we get into the second half. So you kind of put all those pieces together, plus the improving economic environment, everything that we're seeing in terms of job growth, unemployment rate, all the things that Tim talked about, the macroeconomic environment certainly is supportive of our plan. And we see it in the numbers, as I mentioned.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if I could just ask one more. On Page 9, you talked about, I guess, the peaking supply. And it sounds like you expect a little bit more to hit in '15. I'm just trying to figure out how much of that was maybe a shift of projects from '14 into '15 maybe due to delays, and how much of that was actually just kind of new starts that had maybe taken place in the middle of this year that weren't captured in your previous expectations but are now likely to hit in '15. And as you kind of look into '16, it sounds like you think that number may fall even further.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, Steve. This is Tim. When we were looking at it in the beginning of the year, our projections for 2014 was right around 2% of stock and -- for '14. About 1.6% for '15. There's been a little bit of a shift from '14 to '15 just from deals getting delayed or things coming online a little bit later than we had anticipated. I'm not talking about ours, but the market. And so now the numbers are right around 1.9% and 1.8%, so there's been a net increase, call it a 10 basis points over those 2 years. And then '16 has been -- I think, at the beginning of the year, we were projecting about 1.2%. We're now close to about 1.5%. Obviously, less visibility at the beginning of the year than there is today right now. And we have been able to identify some other projects that just weren't as clear at the beginning of this year. So that's what we've talked about. We do expect some paper, but as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, development still make sense. It's a healthy business, and that's when you should add capacity into a market is when underlying fundamentals support it. And so we think structural demand can handle that, particularly given some of the things that rental housing goes -- has going for it. But we do see it leveling off. And when you start looking at that start date and peeling it back and trying to understand how much of it is multifamily for rent, and the fact -- the notion that some of that could convert over to condominium, we feel pretty good about those -- that outlook.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On expenses, can you comment on which line items are contributing to the lower expense growth in the second half? And I think you mentioned that repairs and maintenance were a little bit front-loaded this year.","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Jana. This is Sean. You're correct, the last part of your statement there, in that we expected the first half to be elevated for a number of different reasons that we alluded to in the first quarter call. In terms of some of the specific categories for the second half, it does depend on which bucket of assets you're talking about, so I'll talk about it in the context of the combined bucket, the Avalon and Archstone bucket for now. We do expect Q3 to trend down a bit as it relates to -- utilities is one, which is running at an elevated level right now for a couple of different reasons. There are some fixed costs in office ops that we know are going down in the third quarter, as an example. There's also a number of nonroutine projects as you get into the fourth quarter that come off pretty quickly in terms of -- the peak for that activity is typically during the Q2 and Q3 season, as opposed to Q1 and Q4, so it tends to ramp up in Q2, remain a little bit higher in Q3 and then fall off pretty quickly in Q4. And then there's also some costs that are trending down as it relates to some of the categories. The big one really that moves the needle is taxes. We do expect some healthy savings in taxes as you move into particularly Q4. So those are some of the major pieces that are driving it as you look at the second half of the year.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then I know it's still very early to make any comparisons on AVA, eaves and Avalon brands, but anything you could share there on the performance in second quarter? And then maybe just in terms of the lease-ups on AVAs versus Avalons, if you're noticing that the market sees one as more in demand.","Sean J. Breslin","Sure. This is Sean. I could talk a little bit about brand performance within the regions, I think, is the best way to talk about that as opposed to overall just because market differences, West versus East, Northeast versus the Mid-Atlantic, et cetera, does make a difference. But generally, what we're seeing is the Avalon communities are outperforming in New England, New York, New Jersey and the Pacific Northwest right now. The eaves, our lower-priced communities, are outperforming in the California markets, both Northern Cal and Southern Cal. And then the Mid-Atlantic, the Avalon and eaves product is running at a pretty similar pace in terms of year-over-year growth. It's more depending on whether you're in somewhere in Maryland or Northern Virginia or D.C. is really the driving factor right now within the Mid-Atlantic as compared to product type or price point, really, at least for our portfolio, that is. And then in terms of the lease-ups, that's also somewhat market-driven in terms of which are healthier markets, higher price point communities, et cetera. There's not necessarily common thread there in terms of a particular brand outperforming in terms of lease-up pace.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","As a follow-up to Steve's question, I assume that the increase in your expectations for '16 completions is due to your very granular market-level analysis of projects that have been started so far or at least are planned. But directionally, what does this improved job growth environment and the fact that debt costs have stayed quite low, especially with more Fannie, Freddie activity, which access a takeout for developers, what do those factors mean for the outlook for starts in '15 and '16 to you?","Timothy J. Naughton","Dave, this is Tim. As we've said, if you look at the underlying fundamentals, I'm not sure -- and then when you start comparing it to other sectors and where they are in their cycle, I don't know that we see anything that leads us to believe it ought to ramp up dramatically. But we don't see anything that leads us to believe it ought to ramp down dramatically, either. As I said in my opening remarks, I think it's been -- so far, what you've seen is a pretty disciplined market response. And frankly, since the early '90s, that's basically what we've seen in the multifamily rental business. We haven't really seen a period of oversupply, really, since the late '80s in our business. And I do attribute that quite a bit to just the quality of the data and, certainly, the visibility and transparency coming from the public companies. And again, based upon how we're looking at availability of capital, most of the REITs are trading somewhere around NAV. And as we look at the NMHC equity availability index, nothing really points to a significantly increased appetite over the last couple of years for our product.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And another question relates to Page 15 of your presentation, the suburban versus urban performance. Where do you rate Avalon's portfolio on these metrics, urban versus suburban? What percentage of your portfolio falls in each bucket? And what are your long-term objectives for the portfolio on these metrics?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, Dave. In terms of our portfolio, the stabilized portfolio is about 2\/3 suburban today, about 65%, and about 1\/3 urban. What's currently under construction is about 50-50. And then if you look at the development pipeline, it's about 75-25 -- the development right pipeline, it's about 75-25, tilted towards suburban. And I do want to be clear what suburban means for us, because I do think sometimes, it's a bit misunderstood. For the most part, for us, suburban is office center and inside. It's not bedroom, leafy community, and there are very few exceptions to that. And then if you look at just within our suburban footprint, a fair bit of it is TOD -- we sort of classify as TOD suburban, which is on the order of 15% to 20%, depending on whether you're looking at stabilized or developmental portfolios. So right now, about 2\/3 suburban, maybe trending up 200, 300 basis points as the current development starts to lease up, and then probably starting to trend down again as the development right pipeline starts to come through the system.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And the last question relates to your writeup in the management letter on West Hollywood. You mentioned 85 apartments will be marketed via your high-end Signature Collection. I'm not sure that I'm familiar with that. Is that a new brand? Or what is that offering?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","This is Matt. I guess I'll speak to that one a little bit. Really, it's -- the thought is it's a sub-brand. It is within the Avalon brand, but that -- even within the Avalon brand, there is an appetite in the market for kind of a top-niche product that serves a subsegment of the Avalon customer base. And we are actually doing a little bit of this already. There's certainly high-rise communities we have in New York and other locations where we'll take the top 2 or 3 floors, make them penthouse levels, finish them out to a different finished standard. But we're trying to create more of a program around that going forward. So over time, it will have a separate section on our website and bundle it with some other services. And we think it's actually a growing market. We have had great success with it kind of on an ad hoc basis, even in places like Rockville Centre in Long Island, where we have a number of apartments that are finished to that higher standard and -- as well as -- again, I think we'll be able to have some at the top of the building. So it's really a way that we can kind of further evolve the brand and further segment the customer.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","So it's your core customer, but at the very high end?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","Exactly.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And I think that there's senior housing in this project as well. It's not related to that, is it?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","No, it's not. You're right that the entitlement includes 77 units of affordable senior housing that we're actually developing in a partnership with a local nonprofit there, and we're going to build it for them, and then they will buy it on completion.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And is that just a one-off incident, or should we expect to see some more of that from you?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","It's very deal-specific. We do -- as you may know, a number of our communities that we develop have an affordable component. Usually, it's anywhere 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and it's just -- those apartments are scattered within the project. But occasionally, there are sites like this where it's approved as a separate component of the community, in this case because it was seniors. And by doing it in that format, you can avail yourself of federal tax credits and other subsidies that aren't available to us as a normal REIT. So I wouldn't call it a trend. I think it was more of kind of a one-off that we might do from time to time as a way to maximize the value of a site.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","I just wanted to follow up on the suburban, urban breakout. You said suburban is beginning to outpace urban. I was curious which markets you're starting to see that more so. And based on your current revenue growth forecast, where do you see that spread ending the year?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes. This is Tim. I don't know that we have a spread for you as it relates to how it's going to perform. Maybe I'll just share a couple of other statistics, too, just in terms of how we're seeing the markets generally. As I mentioned before, in terms of apartment completions, we're expecting just a little over 5% added over the 2014 to '16 period into our markets. When you break that down between suburban and urban, suburban, we are expecting about a 3.5% addition to stock; urban, we're expecting about an 8% addition to stock. And then when you look back at 2013, those numbers were comparable, where urban added about 2% to stock and suburban a little less than 1%. And so, while we're just starting to see suburban performance outperform, we've been seeing it in the same-unit rent for some time now. You need to seize that before it actually starts translating into performance. And so if we've -- if you've heard us talk about this over the last couple of quarters, we've been talking about it pretty confidently that we expect this to happen, in part because we were seeing it in the numbers that are often, generally, the leading indicators to performance. But as it relates to specific markets, I may let Sean speak to that, but generally, across the board, we were seeing suburban outperform urban when you break it down into same-unit rent growth, whether it's D.C., whether it's New York, whether it's Boston, whether it's Seattle, whether -- even in San Francisco, where East Bay and San Jose is outperforming San Francisco. So I'd say it's pretty much an across-the-board trend.","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Ryan, there's really not much else than there other than what Tim said is that, if you think about all the different markets and where the majority of the supply has been, it's been more in the urban core. And so we have seen that in terms of effective market rent growth over the past couple of quarters that is slowly bleeding into revenue growth.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. Appreciate the color there. And one last one for me, just on Slide 11, just curious how this slide would look in terms of your market-level outlook for the second to fourth quarter for the Avalon and the Archstone assets, if there was any significant differences in terms of your revisions when you tighten the overall same-store guidance.","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Ryan. This is Sean. There are some differences in terms of overall performance. We've not necessarily provided all the detail in terms of the -- all the Archstone-level detail, market by market. We've provided, at this point, the AvalonBay bucket year-to-date, which we'll continue to report on, as well as the combined bucket on a year-over-year basis. But in terms of the differences within the respective markets, I'd say where probably it's most pronounced in terms of the gap is really in the Mid-Atlantic, and that's purely a function of portfolio allocation. If you look at the Archstone portfolio that has come in the same-store, 95% of that is -- based on revenue, is in Northern Virginia and D.C., as compared to about 65% for the legacy AvalonBay portfolio. And what's outperforming right now in Metro D.C. is suburban Maryland. So that's probably the most pronounced difference in terms of performance, just a little bit in New York in terms of -- same thing, portfolio allocation, where we've got 2 big Archstone assets in Midtown West that are exposed to a little more near-term supply as compared to the legacy Avalon portfolio, which is mainly the Bowery, Morningside Heights, Brooklyn supporting a little bit better revenue growth. So without going through every single market, those are probably 2 that are the pretty good examples of where the variance is.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Alexander Goldfarb with sandleroneill.com.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just quick -- 2 quick questions here. First, just following up on the earlier question on the Northeast. If you look at what the environment was like at the beginning of the year, I mean, Fairfield County wasn't in any great shape. Obviously, the development that's going on in Stamford Harbor Area has been going on for quite some time, and the winter was well known and was ongoing. So just sort of curious why you guys thought that New England collectively would do better when it seems to be performing as we'd expect.","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Alex. Sean. I mean, certainly, when we provided our original outlook in January, we didn't necessarily have a sense of what would be happening with the full extent of the winter and the contraction in the economy that occurred in the first quarter that was not anticipated. So our belief is that, particularly in Boston, things would be quite a bit stronger than they are today. In terms of Fairfield, we did not expect to have significant outperformance there by any stretch. And I'd say it's been relatively closer to our expectations. What's underperformed is really Boston. I don't think there's a material change in Fairfield. We thought it'd be a little bit better job growth, to be honest, and there really has been almost 0. So Boston is really the market in New England where it's underperformed our expectations that we originally set back at the beginning of the year.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then going to the heat map, appreciate the changes, especially in equity. I doubt we'll ever see the equity at near 100 on your heat map. But just given how the stock has rebounded, obviously, you guys retapped the HEM. At the same time, market still seems pretty healthy for dispositions. And obviously, a desire -- as you guys did with Danvers and you did with Christie Place, there's still a desire to capitalize lock-in value that you created. How do you balance dispositions, which are still healthy, versus taking advantage of your stock, which is up over 20% year-to-date, and using more equity going forward? The heat map aside, just how do you consider that tradeoff, given where you were not even 6 months ago?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure. I may start out with a couple of comments, and Tim may want to add something. But essentially, the heat map does provide some insight as to how we think about the question, although it's certainly not as positive. And as to the equity component of where we're showing it now, there's actually 4 subcomponents that we track that feed into that overall number. And probably, of those 4 subcomponents, as you might expect, the one that's most important to us from a standpoint of just assessing the relative attractiveness of issuing common equity would be how our shares are trading relative to NAV. And so we look at that relative to consensus NAV, as well as our own estimate, which, as you know, we don't publish. But just tracking it relative to consensus NAV, that green is at a higher level than what you see as the overall rating and more in line with where you see assets trading on the heat map. I guess, for us, it's ultimately not a binary choice of -- between whether we're going to issue equity or fund equity through asset sales. As you know, looking back at our company's history, we've typically traded a slight discount to NAV, call it about 3%. And not surprisingly, over time, we've funded development activity, primarily -- at least the equity component of development activity, through selling assets and recycling the balance sheet. It's an approach that's worked very well for us. It's an approach that we're very comfortable with going forward. But from time to time, when it makes sense to tap the equity markets, we're prepared to do so. So we do look at the relative implied cap rate on issuing shares versus the realizable cap rates that we have on dispositions and take a look at those. We also effect both yields or prices for asset sales versus issuing common equity by transaction costs, which can be meaningful in the case of transaction costs and also meaningful in the case of issuing equity to the extent it's done in a marketed deal where you have both investment banking fees and investor discounts in the equation. So we look at that really on a net-net basis to see what's more attractive. There's also portfolio considerations that come into play in terms of our desirability to sell assets and enhance the portfolio and our exposure to given submarkets. So at the end of the day, there's an awful lot of factors that we bring to the equation. Those are some of the things we think about. But going forward, in an environment where we're trading at or above NAV, it's reasonable to expect that were going to look at both the possibility of issuing equity and the selling of assets as attractive and try to make the best decision from a pricing standpoint and a portfolio perspective.","Timothy J. Naughton","Alex, maybe just one thing I'd add is just the time-to-market, too, on the dispositions, that we take that into account as well, as well as tax considerations. But I think Christie Place is a good example of that, where you need certain agency approvals. And it takes several months to get a -- from the time you actually price the transaction to the point at which you actually can bring the proceeds in. So that is a factor, as well, as we think about how we tap different sources of capital at different points during the year or during the cycle.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rich Anderson with Mizuho.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","So you've shown some willingness to think above -- in front of the curve with your suburban kind of mindset versus urban. Can the same kind of thought process be applied to asset sales? That is, when do you start thinking about selling, actually, in San Francisco and Seattle and investing a bit more in D.C. and making that early-stage trade before things start to turn in the opposite direction?","Timothy J. Naughton","Rich, this is Tim. Absolutely. We actually, as you know, were pretty big sellers in the Mid-Atlantic 2, 3 years ago. And I think we have to remind ourselves that the underperformance in D.C. has been 2 quarters now. We've been talking about it coming for about 2.5, 3 years, I think, as an industry because you could just see the supply kind of coming through the system. But in terms of really actual underperformance, it's been really mostly the last couple of quarters. So we did take -- obviously, we tried to take advantage of it a couple of years ago in the D.C. market in terms of selling. But we'll look to take advantage of it on the buy side, as well. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, most of these markets have -- we think they're great markets. We love them all. Sometimes, we like some of them at different points in the cycle than others. And we should be willing to sort of trade off of when we think sort of market sentiment gets a bit distorted as it relates to asset value. So it -- that factors a lot into how we've been thinking about the fund business, where you're -- it's a real limited-life vehicle. You just really have very few windows to sort of pull the trigger. I'd say it's maybe a little less pressing on -- in terms of the balance sheet, in terms of an open-ended entity like a REIT is. But it's still something that we talked a lot about in terms of which assets and when and how to play the cycle. And ultimately, we are looking to differentiate ourselves in terms of capital allocation, and that's one aspect of capital allocation.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. How close do you think we are to a trigger point in San Francisco?","Sean J. Breslin","Rich, this is Sean. We've been evaluating dispositions in, I'll say, kind of group Northern California and Seattle for some period of time. We've taken a few chips off the table, both directly and indirectly. We sold a large asset in San Jose last year. We sold a fund asset that was pretty large in San Francisco. I think one of the things that we're thinking about for San Francisco proper, if that's what you're really referring to, is there may be some option value there at some point in terms of condo activity. We've not seen that in any meaningful way in San Francisco at this point, but we have seen some activity in New York. We've also seen a couple of deals here in D.C. shift from rental to condo. And particularly, given the TOPA rules in D.C., you want to do that basically when you're completing the building, before you lease it up, so you don't have that restraint. So San Francisco, we're keeping our eyes open. But I'd say at this point, we think there may be good value there in terms of a condo exit at some point for some assets. So we're not hot to pull the trigger in terms of that particular market in terms of near-term dispositions. But, I mean, we're always evaluating all the markets. As Tim said, we look at a lot of different factors. We look at where rents are relative to the long-term trend. We look at forward IRRs on every asset in our portfolio as we develop our disposition pool and how's that capital priced relative to other sources of capital. And we try to be as opportunistic as we can. So you're right. We sold, I think, probably around $400 million in assets in D.C. over the last 2 or 3 years, knowing kind of the current environment was coming. But there hopefully will be a window at some point where we see pricing and expectations change in D.C., and it might be a good entry point. And for acquisitions, I think we think of using them 2 ways. One is to kind of reshape the portfolio in terms of portfolio trading. But also, at certain entry points of the cycle, to be -- to acquire assets when they're trading at discounts relative to where we think they should. So sort of a long-winded answer, but hopefully, that makes some sense. And Tim might have a couple of other things to add.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes. Rich, just one other thing to keep in mind on San Francisco or any California assets, I think the underlying difference between intrinsic value and market value needs to be a bit more distorted because of the whole Prop 13 and the frictional cost that you have with the mark on the taxes. I mean, it can be as -- it can impact cash flow by as much as 10% when you mark these -- when you mark taxes fully to market.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. Next question is, just looking at Slide 5, why is it that the Archstone and conclusion of the Archstone portfolio, at least the math suggested a better operating margin there in that portfolio versus legacy AVB. What's the situation there? Why is that happening?","Sean J. Breslin","Rich, this is Sean. Let me talk just generally about the difference in terms of the portfolio. In terms of the operating margins, specifically, if that's what you're looking at, the main driver of that is taxes. In terms of -- obviously, the Archstone taxes are pretty much reset upon acquisition as opposed to the legacy AvalonBay portfolio. So there are some other subtle differences, but that would be the main driver in terms of margin, if that's the specific metric you're concerned about.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","I was just looking at how it changed from the original forecast. Right, it seems to have...","Sean J. Breslin","In terms of the operating...","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Extrapolate -- exacerbated to some degree since the original forecast.","Sean J. Breslin","In terms of overall expense growth, it's savings on taxes.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay, okay. Okay, got you. All right. And then last question is, the topic of senior housing was brought up and couldn't help but ask the question to Tim about if he's learning anything on his seat at the HCN Board of Directors and if there's any coincidence there.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes. There's -- it has nothing to do with sitting on the board of Health Care REIT. So no, that was just an entitlement requirement when we stepped into the deal that already -- where the approval has already been started by another developer in the case of West Hollywood, if that's what you're talking about, Rich.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Yes. But are you learning anything? Is there anything that you can apply from your experience there to AvalonBay?","Timothy J. Naughton","Absolutely. Any time you step on a board of another company, you learn a lot of things about how -- about their business and how you might apply it. I don't know if there's anything there as it relates to -- which is primarily assisted housing, to market rate rental, where the customer is about 50 years difference in age. But even in terms of how you think about capital and how you think about organizations and strategy, for sure.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Are you thinking about U.K.?","Timothy J. Naughton","Are we thinking about U.K., as in United Kingdom?","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Timothy J. Naughton","We are not considering other markets at this time, if that's what you're asking.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs.","Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a speed round here for Kevin. When you do your capital allocation and you're deciding whether or not to sell shares, I've got $20 on my price target that's associated with, essentially, the value of your development franchise. And do you take that into account? Because when you're selling an asset, you're just selling the income rather than this underlying development business that, as far as I can tell, is adding heck of a lot of value.","Kevin P. O'Shea","When we look at our own NAV, we do take into account the value from -- off of our development platform.","Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Because it just sounded like you were going for a consensus NAV, which just would mark-to-market the existing development rather than treating it like it's a recurring business.","Kevin P. O'Shea","Sure. In terms of -- well, there's -- the methodology that people use in their own NAVs varies from analyst to analyst. But you're correct that most of them typically focus on in-place NOI and the value of development underway and don't necessarily ascribe value to the development platform per se.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes. Andrew, this is Tim. I think I understand what you're getting at. And as Kevin mentioned before, for whatever reason, we've traditionally traded at around 3% discount to NAV. And so just -- yes, we think there's value there. The market doesn't generally give you credit for it. And if we were only to raise equity when we thought the market was giving us credit for it, we'd never be raising equity. We wouldn't be growing. We wouldn't be doing new development. So it is a reason why we use dispositions pretty aggressively in terms of recycling capital, as well as expanding the balance sheet and looking to the unsecured markets, as well as we grow -- as we grow EBITDA and, therefore, are able to expand the balance sheet through debt. But equity just still needs to be part of the equation if we're going to be able to grow accretively, which we have a wonderful opportunity set, particularly this cycle in front of us, to do so through development. So we'd like the market to give us that full $20 credit that you've got in your model, but it -- the market, for whatever reason, has been a little bit of a \"show me\" market, and we get credit for it, it seems like in arrears, not an advance.","Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, it's the problem -- every time you issue that share, what -- that share of that $20 gets split over a larger pool, so I just wanted to ask.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a quick question. Just -- we haven't talked about L.A. here, but just curious if you could comment on what you're seeing there. It does seem like, just looking at the rental rate growth year-over-year, it did slow down there a little bit more than average for the rest of the portfolio. Just curious if you have any commentary on that.","Sean J. Breslin","Yes. Vince, this is Sean. In terms of L.A., it really is a function of where you're playing. And for us, what's outperforming right now is really the eaves product, lower price point communities, as I mentioned earlier in response to another question. So we've got a number of communities in the Claremont and even some of the lower price point communities in the Pasadena submarket that are outperforming, one in Cerritos. What's underperforming a little bit right now is generally areas where we're getting a little more supply. It's a little bit on the west side: Wilshire, Marina del Rey. Some of those submarkets are under pressure a little bit in terms of supply. But in terms of the overall outlook for L.A., I'd say, pretty positive generally for us for L.A. And, frankly, for Southern California overall, it's trending in a positive direction. If you look at what's happening with rent change in that market. Southern California has improved quite a bit as we have moved through the quarter and we get into July. Just to give you some sense, Southern Cal rent change in the second quarter was in the mid-3s. And as we look at what's happening in July, and July is about closed out, it's trending about 5% in Southern Cal. So we're getting pretty good momentum, probably a little bit better momentum in Orange County as opposed to L.A., but L.A. is catching up, I'd say. So it's really a function of where you are as to how you're feeling about L.A. right at the moment.","Operator","And the next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just following up on Boston, if you could talk in particular about the Assembly Row assets and just how those are leasing up relative to expectations.","Sean J. Breslin","Sure. Tayo, this is Sean. I'll talk a little bit about the general velocity. Overall, as you can probably tell from reading through the release, construction has been a little bit challenged at that particular asset. When we initially started the asset, part of the winter was challenged in terms of site conditions. It's also a community they we're building with retail in conjunction with the Federal. So construction has been -- it's probably been one of our more challenging construction executions in terms of the portfolio, in terms of what's happening there. In terms of leasing velocity, now that we have actually delivered product there, it's actually been pretty good in terms of actual leasing absorption velocity. We put 38 a month on the books at that community in terms of leasing velocity and 31 in terms of absorption. So now that we've actually got the product on the ground, it looks good, velocity has been healthy at the product there.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And on rent, kind of trending around $3 per square foot or so?","Sean J. Breslin","Rents for -- there's 2 different product types there, so I'm not sure which one you might be referring to.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","The AvalonBay product, not the...","Matthew H. Birenbaum","Yes. Tayo, this is Matt. I guess the -- what we're showing, this is one of our dual-brand communities. So I know there's been some talk about the rents, and I think even Federal talked about them. But the average rent that we're showing in the release this quarter is $2,405. That number reflects the Avalon component of the project, which is about half of it, which is substantially leased, and that's been running ahead of pro forma by more than that amount. Then the AVA building, which is the back half of the project, we really just started leasing there, and we have not yet marked those rents to market because we haven't leased 20% of the AVA component yet. So I guess what I would say is there's more lift to come in those rents there, and I would expect, next quarter, that number would move up as we mark those AVA rents to market. But we haven't actually -- we've leased 10% of the AVA building, but we actually haven't been able to show anybody an AVA apartment yet. It's all been -- that piece has all been off of plans. And the AVA story, you really have to see it and feel it to fully experience it. So I think that we have good momentum there, and you can expect further growth there as we complete the lease-up.","Sean J. Breslin","Yes. And Tayo, this is Sean again. I think they rents per foot are in the high $2 range. I'm not sure we put $3 yet there. But as we deliver the rest of the product and get the AVA online, we should have a better sense of whether we'll get through that or not and mark the rents to markets.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Any changes in cap rates in recent months in your markets? And as you're weighing changes in construction costs, economic outlook and the decline in your capital cost, can you just update us on your latest thoughts on sizing the development pipeline over the medium term?","Sean J. Breslin","Karin, this is Sean. I'll take the first one, and then I'll let Tim and Matt comment on the second one. In terms of the cap rates, I'd say they're relatively level to slightly down in some markets, probably a function of supply, just availability of deals on the market more than anything else, as well as, obviously, the drip-down of the tenure has supported pretty good access to cheap debt capital, which Kevin showed on the heat map in terms of we can access on the unsecured markets, but also in terms of the secured markets. All of the options are pretty wide open in terms of the GSEs, which were once 90% of the market, are now pretty much about half or less. But banks, life companies, everybody else is pretty much wide open on the debt side and supporting relatively low cap rates overall and still generating nice returns on equity. So the debt markets are wide open. Supply of available deals has been a little bit constrained. So I'd say it's neutral to slightly down, down 10, 20 basis points, depending on a particular market and the availability of assets to trade. And then in terms of the development, Tim can take that.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes. Thanks to Sean. And in terms of targeted net levered IRRs, we're still seeing this kind of mid-6 or so range for core product at our market. In terms of deals that we're looking at, I mean, less are sort of hitting the target return, probably driven a lot by land cost. Matt had spoken to that before. But looking at returns, and target returns are only part of the equation, as you get deeper into the cycle, just the projected basis goes up when you look at the combination of land and construction cost. So just by -- just due to those things, less sort of get through the screen, if you will. And so we do expect it. And you probably notice, on the development right pipeline, it's actually come down by about $500 million over the last couple of quarters as we started to start deals and haven't replaced them at the same level. And that is partly by intention, and it's partly due to the -- frankly, due to the opportunity set. So we do expect, as we said at the beginning of the year, development underway to peak around now will slowly work its way down, I think, over the next couple of years. Probably not going to go to 0, but we're probably at the peak today in terms of what's underway.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just in the interest of time, I just had 2 quick follow-up questions. First of all, you gave new lease rents in the management letter. What were renewals that were actually signed during the quarter? And then also, Kevin, it looks like in July, you sold the last Fund I asset. I know you were holding the debt there to kind of repay that. Is there going to be a promote recognized on that when that's finally wound down?","Timothy J. Naughton","Go ahead, Sean.","Sean J. Breslin","Mike, it's Sean. In terms of the rent change during the quarter, 3.6% was the blended. It's 4.8% on renewals and 2.2% on move-ins, if that was the highlight you're looking for.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Kevin P. O'Shea","And Mike, this is Kevin. In terms of Fund I, yes, you're correct, we sold the last and 20th asset in Fund I in July. So there are no assets left in that vehicle. We'll be winding it up here, distributing final cash in the coming months. In terms of whether there'll be a promote, we do not expect there to be a promote on Fund I. As you may recall, we put that vehicle in place in 2005. So like many funds from that vintage, its returns were not strong enough to realize a promote, but they were still positive. And on a net levered IRR basis to our investors, we expect to give them a mid-single-digit net levered IRR, which would probably for assets -- for closed-end funds of that vintage, would place it in the top third or so of closed-end funds, all geographies, all product types.","Timothy J. Naughton","Mike, if I can just add something to what Sean was saying. I mean, what Sean said was accurate with 2.2% on move-ins for the quarter. But the one chart that showed same-unit rent numbers going up through the course of the year, that is almost all coming from increases in new move-in rents, which I think is important when you're talking about health of markets. In fact, June and July are more in the 2.8% to -- and 3.3% range, so well above what the average was in Q2 and well above the 1% to 1.5% range that we saw at the beginning of the year. Renewals have actually been relatively flat -- healthy, but flat during the course of the year. So that, Slide 14, that upward trajectory is really coming all on the backs of new move-in, which is what we think it's important as you move into the second half of the year and part of what gives us confidence in terms of our outlook for the balance of the year.","Operator","And we'll take our last question as a follow-up from Nick Joseph from Citigroup.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. It's actually Michael Bilerman. Just a couple of quick ones. Just on the $350 million of disposition proceeds in the back half of the year, I've got to assume if that includes the promote in Christie Place. The blended cost of that capital is extraordinarily low, call it, I don't know, 3%. Is that sort of ballpark where we should think about the cost of that capital?","Kevin P. O'Shea","Yes. It -- Michael, this is Kevin O'Shea. So in terms of the promote from Christie, the proceeds that we receive, the cash proceeds that we would receive from selling Christie, are included in that $350 million of net proceeds from dispositions that you referenced. In terms of the cost, in the case of Christie, it would probably be more because, as you'll see in the attachment in our supplemental work that detail NOI from our various ventures, we are and have been for some time in the cash flow promote portion of that promote for Christie. So we've been receiving a cash flow promote off of Christie for some time. So when you blend that all in, while the cap rate itself may be quite attractive from an FFO perspective, the cost of selling Christie is higher than what you are estimating. And from our point of view, certainly, that cost is something we thought about. It's not a positive, if you will. But promotes themselves are very dependent on current market values and are -- themselves can be short-lived and based -- and disappear with changes in the capital markets environment. So from our standpoint, on a net basis, it was desirable to monetize the position in that venture, from our perspective, in order to access that promote in the current environment.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. So on that $350 million, the cost of that capital is what?","Sean J. Breslin","This is Sean, Mike. One piece of it I can address is the dispositions that are in the pipeline. Just to give you a rough sense of those communities, setting aside Christie for the moment, the cap rate is probably in the sub-5% range for a blend of the assets, excluding Christie. And given the status of where we are in Christie Place, we're just not at a point to be too precise as to what we think the real cost of that is until the transaction closes and we can provide a little more detail.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just a clarification, just in terms of the operating expense change between the 2 pools, you've talked about taxes being an impact. But isn't it the weather impact in the first quarter that's impacting the legacy Avalon portfolio now that you've rolled that -- you've updated it, effectively inclusive of the high weather-related expenses in the first quarter that obviously don't impact the 2Q to 3Q -- 4Q in terms of Archstone. Is that the main difference between the 2?","Sean J. Breslin","Well, there's the difference in taxes, as well, so you have a difference in taxes. So if I had to separate them in terms of the expense growth, what's benefiting the Archstone portfolio the most is taxes. And it doesn't have issues associated with the change we have in our business practice related to utilities, which is the pressure that's coming through on the Avalon portfolio. So Archstone, main benefit, call it taxes. AvalonBay legacy portfolio is burdened by a number of factors, including the items that you talked about in terms of weather-related utilities, the change in the business practice that's putting pressure on utilities as well, as well as upward pressure on taxes. So it has the opposite of the Archstone portfolio in terms of taxes, more pressure on taxes in the AvalonBay portfolio that we've seen. Things start to shift as we move into the second half of the year, as you pointed out. The majority of the Archstone benefit in taxes has come through in the second quarter, but there is some remaining benefit in the third and fourth quarter. In addition, on the Archstone portfolio, because of when we acquired the asset and the way we treat certain expenditures, they were capitalized in the first portion of '13, and they were expensed in the first portion of '14. So that put upward pressure on Archstone that we won't have in the second half. So as you go through each one, there's different things driving the year-over-year comparisons. And if you want to talk about it in more detail, certainly, give me a call and I could walk you through it, but those are some of the main highlights.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes. And Mike, just one last -- I think, as Sean -- as you can tell from Sean's comments, there's just some noise -- there's going to be some noise in the Archstone portfolio for -- on a year-over-year basis, may have less of those as you get to the end of the year than we did in the middle of the year. But we thought it was still better to try to provide a more expansive same-store portfolio for the last 3 quarters, despite there are likely to be more noise in those numbers. But we'll do our best to explain the noise as we move through the year and so some people have good terms sense of it.","Operator","This concludes today's Q&A session for your program.

Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton","Thanks, John. Welcome to our fourth quarter call. Joining me today are Tom Sargeant, our Chief Financial Officer; and Leo Horey, EVP of Property Operations. Tom and I have some prepared remarks, and then the 3 of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.","I'll start by touching on some of the operating and investment highlights from last quarter and an overview of 2011. In addition, I'll provide a few comments about our outlook for the economy and our partner markets for the coming year. Tom will then discuss some of the financial highlights for the quarter and review our financial outlook for 2012. Lastly, I'll come back to provide some color on the press release we issued in December in which we announced the launch of 2 new apartment brands.","Last night, we reported FFO per share of $1.19, which was up 18% over the prior year. In addition, we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend of 9% for 2012 based upon this continued strong performance and our outlook for 2012. Results in Q4 were driven primarily by strong same-store NOI growth atop 10% for the quarter, driven by same-store revenue growth of 6.2% and a decline of same-store expenses of 1.8%.","Same-store NOI growth was particularly strong in California, which posted growth greater than 15% in both Northern and Southern California. Northern California continued to be our strongest region, while Southern California is still relatively early in its recovery, with Orange County and Los Angeles leading the way in that region.","In Q4, we continue to be very active across the board in the area of investments. We started 4 new developments, totaling almost $500 million, and now have $1.5 billion underway. Two of the new starts were AVA communities, which is one of the 2 brands we formally launched last quarter. This brand, which is targeted at a youthful urban-minded demographic that craves the energy in the neighborhood, is ideally suited for the 2 neighborhoods where we began construction this past quarter, West Chelsea in Manhattan and the H Street Corridor in Northeast D.C.","We also continue to replenish the pipeline in Q4, adding another 7 deals totaling $500 million in new development rights. Most of these deals are located on the West Coast, where fundamentals are showing the most momentum. We expect that we will continue to add to the pipeline over the next couple of quarters as we have another several $100 million dollars worth of development rights under contract and in due diligence.","The economics of development remain attractive as the average projected yield for the $1.5 billion under construction is close to 7% or around 200 basis points over prevailing cap rates. In addition, the deals in our development right pipeline, as well as those currently in due diligence, add projected yields consistent with those under construction in the 6.5% to 7% range based upon current rents and current construction costs. As a result, we expect that development will continue to be an important driver of growth and value creation over the next few years.","We continue to shape and reposition the portfolio in Q4 through transaction activity and redevelopment. Last quarter we sold 5 assets, 3 that were wholly owned and 2 that were owned by our First Investment Management Fund. Two of the wholly owned assets that were sold, Cameron Court and Rock Spring, are in the D.C. market and were sold for $220 million and an economic gain of over $120 million.","Given the growing permitting activity and the uncertain impact of potential fiscal reform on the D.C. area over the next 2 to 3 years, we thought it was a good time to harvest value. Despite our recent actions, D.C. remains an important target market for us. And over the long term, we expect to increase our exposure in this market.","Finally, during the quarter, we started the redevelopment of 6 existing stabilized communities, including 2 under the AVA brand and one under the Eaves by Avalon brand, which is a brand targeted to a more value-oriented and cost-conscious consumer. We currently have 12 communities under redevelopment that represent a broad mix of assets, containing all 3 brands, including 5 Avalon, 3 AVA and 4 Eaves communities.","For the year, FFO per share was up over 14% and adjusting for non-routine items was up by around 16.5%. This was the strongest growth in FFO per share since 2000. We enjoyed this strong growth despite an economy that didn't live up to expectations as the year began. The corporate sector, now flushed with cash and restored balance sheets, was expected to lead the economy to recovery in 2011 but failed to do so, as companies became reluctant to expand their businesses as confidence faltered. As a result, growth in GDP of under 2% came in below expectations. The economy created only 1.5 million jobs or about half of what was expected at the beginning of the year and not enough to make a meaningful impact on the unemployment rate.","Given this environment, consumers reacted in a predictable manner, reluctant to spend and focused on restoring their own balance sheets, as consumer debt fell to the lowest levels since 1993. Offsetting this tepid job growth and lack of business and consumer confidence though were a number of dynamics that benefited the apartment industry. Homeownership rates continue to fall another 50 basis points for the year and 3x that rate for younger adults age 34 or under. In addition, while job growth was quite modest, it was pretty good for this young adult cohort, up around 2% or about twice the rate for the overall economy. As a result, the rental household growth was much stronger among this important group of apartment renters, which contributed to strong apartment absorption in 2011.","On the supply side, the apartment industry benefited from the lingering effect of the credit crisis of '08 and '09, as new apartment completions of 80,000 for the year were less than 40% of the average experience over the last 15 years. The combination of strong absorption and reduced deliveries worked in the apartment industry's favor in 2011 and helped fuel solid earnings growth in spite of the weak economy. With the favorable fundamentals that emerged for apartments in 2011, rents and valuations largely recovered to their pre-downturn levels.","For AvalonBay, growth in FFO per share for the year was driven in large part by same-store NOI growth of 8.5%. While every region posted healthy growth, markets with greater exposure to technology outperformed, including San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle and Boston. We made significant progress toward some of our portfolio management objectives, with more than $1 billion of transaction activity. We added 8 communities in Southern California, trimmed our position in D.C. and recycled capital out of Boston, where we had a robust development pipeline.","We took advantage of strong fundamentals and cyclically low construction costs by starting almost $900 million in new developments and close to another $100 million in redevelopment. We pre-funded most of these new capital commitments through a well-timed $750 million discrete equity offering in August and by year-end, had ample liquidity to fund all outstanding commitments.","Our balance sheet is the strongest in the sector and is very well positioned to support new external growth opportunities, particularly as we build out our development pipeline of $4 billion plus.","So now that 2011 is in the books, sitting here in early 2012, what are our expectations for the coming year?","After the midyear slump in 2011, the economy started to regain its footing by year end, as GDP growth approached 3% in Q4. Improved job growth in December of around 200,000, combined with positive revisions in prior months, surprised to the upside. Business sentiment appears to slowly be improving as Moody's business confidence survey and small business sentiment have increased in the last few months. In addition, the consumer is in better shape than this time last year, having improved their balance sheets and confidence, while still fragile, has improved in recent months.","While some elements seem to be in place to unstick what has been a stalled recovery, there remain some headwinds that will continue to temper overall economic output. In particular, the public sector, given its own fiscal constraints, has limited ability to provide any further stimulus. And the housing sector, where production levels should continue to run well below historical norms, will continue to be a drag on economic growth. And of course, as we saw last year, confidence can erode quickly, particularly in light of lingering global debt concerns.","Overall, we were expecting still slow to moderate economic growth on the order of 2% to 3% and total U.S. job growth of around 1.5% or just under 2 million jobs in 2012. In terms of industry fundamentals, apartments should begin to benefit or should benefit once again in 2012 from a combination of gradually improving labor market, a weak for-sale market, favorable demographics and modest levels in new supply.","Based upon the current level of starts, which has averaged an annual pace of under 170,000 for the last 3 months, new completions shouldn't pose a threat in most markets for at least a couple of years. In our markets, D.C. will be the exception in 2012, as new deliveries are expected to pick up in the second half of the year. Overall, we expect that demand will outpace supply again this year, which should propel operating performance and result in another strong year for AvalonBay.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom, who will provide some financial highlights for the quarter, as well as an overview of how our expectations for the economy and apartment markets shape our business plan and financial outlook for 2012.","Thomas J. Sargeant","Thanks, Tim. Let me start with an overview of the topics that I'll cover this afternoon, and then we'll go into some detail. First I'd like to discuss the earnings and capital activity for 2011, then I'll provide more color on the 2012 financial outlook that we provided last evening. And then finally, I'd like to talk a little bit about the dividend increase and our general dividend policy.","Tim covered earnings highlights. But in the context of capital activity, earnings growth really stands out. We issued $1 billion of equity capital in 2011 that deleveraged the balance sheet and helps ensure we have the appropriate mix of capital as the investment cycle progresses. And you can see this in the reduction of average leverage as measured by debt to EBITDA, which fell from an average of 7.2x during 2010 to a quarterly average of 5.8 in 2011 and then expected to average between 5 and 5.5 across the quarters in 2012. So a pretty dramatic reduction in leverage paired with pretty robust earnings growth.","We also retired secured debt in 2011 and in early 2012, some at our discretion and some related to pending sales. Charges for early termination of debt were incurred but were absorbed by strong overall earnings from operating assets and new development. Reducing secured debt will also allow us to increase our unencumbered NOI from 68% in 2010 to about 73% in 2012. And importantly, when you look at earnings, floating rate debt did not contribute to earnings growth, as variable-rate debt is less than 15% of all our debt at the end of the year. With about $690 million of cash on hand and $750 million available under our line of credit and a full range of capital market options, our capital plan and liquidity for 2012 is strong.","Turning to the financial outlook that we provided last evening, you will find more detail on these sources and uses of capital, as well as expected operating trends, on Attachments 15 and 16. Our overall outlook for NOI growth at a midpoint of 7% is comprised of about 5.75% revenue growth and approximately 3% expense growth. Northern California will lead revenue growth in 2012, while Washington D.C. will lag the rest of our markets. Operating momentum headed into the new year solid with high occupancy that allows us to push rents earlier in the year for both renewals and new move-ins. And we're already seeing this as renewals and move-in offers are ahead of this time last year.","Cost containment remains a key focus for the company in 2012 but will be a challenge coming off a year where expenses actually declined. We will see less benefit from reduced bad debt in 2012, as the economy recovers, compared to '11 and some expense pressure on property taxes due to tougher comps. Insurance markets are more difficult this year, and we're likely to see upward pressure there as well. But we do have a good track record in constraining expense growth. And for those expense categories, such as insurance and taxes that have an outsized risk of growth, we have seasoned dedicated teams in both our tax department and risk management group to help mitigate that risk.","Turning to investment activity for 2012. It includes new development starts totaling about $1.2 billion and redevelopment spend of about $125 million. We expect to be net positive in acquisitions over dispositions by approximately $100 million in 2012.","In terms of liquidity and the related sources in uses of capital, all of our investment and refinancing capital needs can be met from internal or committed capital sources. But we do plan to raise about $800 million of external capital in '12. Composition of that capital activity depends on capital market conditions at the time we go to market but will likely be a combination of unsecured debt and common stocks.","We don't have any plans for secured debt financing in 2012. But to give you a reference point on the various debt pricing options, I wanted to cover a few data points. Unsecured 10-year debt today comprise between 3.5% and 3.75%. As we sit here today, these are historic lows. Secured insurance source debt would likely be in the 4% to 4.5% range. And GSE or agency financing would probably be in the 3.5% to 3.75% range as well, right on top of unsecured debt.","Finally, Tim noted that our Board approved a 9% dividend increase for 2012, and this level of increase is supported by earnings growth while allowing us to retain a cost-effective source of liquidity at a time where access to liquidity remains important to us. This level of dividend suggests that retained capital from operations will approximate $100 million in 2012, providing an FFO payout ratio of around 72%, which underscores the overall safety of our dividend at these levels. Excluding this announced increase, we've increased the dividend by 40% over the last 10 years, while the weighted average dividend increase for the multi-family sector is actually a decline of 15%.","Finally, we've never cut our dividend, so we're increasing the dividend, not restoring a previously cut dividend. And we have always covered our dividend from recurring cash flow. In terms of dividend policy, our general policy is to present dividend recommendations to the Board once each year, with earnings growth prospects in FFO coverage being the principal drivers in terms of how much of a dividend increase we recommend. These metrics help us determine the margin of safety we have in the dividend and contribute to a sustainable dividend while providing room for growth. Accordingly, this dividend increase is appropriate given our earnings growth last year and the prospects for even higher earnings growth in 2012.","So just to recap my comments. While the capital markets are strong today, we're well prepared for change, with a balance sheet that offers financial flexibility and access to secured and unsecured debt, with both fixed and floating rates. We have clear visibility into our sources and uses of capital for the year, balancing new debt with equity, asset sales and retained cash to fund new development, redevelopment and acquisitions, as well as debt retirements, exercising our financial flexibility, optimize earnings growth and value creation. And finally, our financial outlook provides strong earnings growth, which supports our dividend increase of 9%, while providing one of the lowest payout ratios in this sector and one of the lowest of all REITs.","Tim, that concludes my comments. I'll turn the call back to you.","Timothy J. Naughton","Thanks, Tom. As I mentioned in the introduction, I'd like to take a couple of minutes now to provide a little color regarding the press release we issued in December in which we announced the launch of 2 new apartment brands, AVA and Eaves by Avalon.","AVA is a brand designed to attract the increasing number of people, particularly the younger Gen-Y segment, who want to live in or near high-energy, transit-oriented, urban neighborhoods. AVA communities will generally have small apartments, many designed for roommate living, and feature modern design and technology-focused and amenities that maximize the social experience of residents. The AVA brand will grow through new development and redevelopment. Over the next 2 years, we anticipate having approximately 20 AVA communities in service or under construction.","Eaves by Avalon is targeted to the cost-conscious value segment, seeking good quality apartment living, with practical and functional amenities and service. Eaves by Avalon communities will tend to be older assets, located in suburban areas, with the brand growing through acquisitions and redevelopment. By the end of 2013, we plan to re-flag or redevelop over 40 existing communities to the Eaves brand.","Avalon remains our core offering, focused on upscale apartment living and high-end amenities and services, in leading urban and suburban submarkets. The Avalon brand will continue to grow primarily through new development.","These 3 brands complement one another in terms of target customer segment, submarket focus and method of deployment. This brand framework is a natural extension of a disciplined and time-tested strategy that builds upon and leverages a set of well-established capabilities.","During our history as a public company, we've discussed the structural advantages of our chosen markets, including supply constraints, high incomes, and low housing affordability. During this time, we've been highly disciplined in market selection and portfolio allocation. By investing extensively in local franchises, we've enjoyed a privileged position in these markets that comes with an integrated set of capabilities in the areas of development, construction and operation, as well as the market expertise, business relationships and reputation, resulting from a constant presence and track record of 25-plus years. And it's paid off for investors in the form of strong earnings growth and total shareholder return over an extended period of time.","Over the last couple of years, we've shared with you our desire to expand our concentration of B product as a means of diversification and further penetration of our markets. In addition, we've talked about the importance of submarket selection as a driver of portfolio performance. If markets matter, so do submarkets.","Lastly, we've highlighted the importance of positioning our communities within their respective submarkets to optimize performance, as no single strategy delivers consistent outperformance across all markets or submarkets. To support this sharpened focus in our markets, we have invested significantly in key capabilities, including market research, consumer insight, redevelopment and asset management.","The establishment of a brand framework of distinct offerings targeting unique customer segments further builds upon our existing capabilities, and we believe further extends our competitive advantage across our market footprint. It allows us to further penetrate these advantage markets by segmenting them according to consumer preference and attitude, as well as by location and price. AVA and Eaves by Avalon will help us reach new customers and better serve our existing customers, all while staying within our established geography.","So in essence, our recent announcement is really a refinement and an extension of a strategy that's designed to penetrate and deliver sector-leading performance in what we believe are the best apartment markets in the country.","And with that, Amanda, we're ready to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Rob Stevenson of Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Tom, you were talking about the same-store guidance before. In the supplemental, there's like 6,500 units that you guys have classified as other stabilized, how many of those are rolling into the same-store portfolio this year, and what's the relative impact of that versus the existing same-store portfolio for 2012 guidance?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Rob, in terms how many of those are rolling in the same-store, you can look at the attachment that talks about the number of communities in each basket. We had 37,470 in the basket in 2011, and I think that number is going up to...","Leo S. Horey","About 37,000, Rob, this is Leo, into the same-store's bucket.","Thomas J. Sargeant","So -- but how many in total were increasing going into same store bucket from 37,470 in 2011? My guess is it's a couple of thousand units, but we can get back to you on the detail for that.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Would you expect that those are going to have stronger same store NOI growth in the existing this year or is it going to be relatively stable between the 2?","Leo S. Horey","Rob, this is Leo. It depends on the submarkets that they're in, and they tend to perform pretty consistent with the other same-store assets in those submarkets.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, Leo, did I miss -- did you guys talk about the first quarter or the -- where you were sending out January and February renewals at?","Leo S. Horey","We didn't comment on that yet, Rob, but I'll give you the information. In the fourth quarter, we made a conscious effort to focus on getting availability down and occupancy up. And as you probably saw, occupancy rate at about 96% for the fourth quarter. That's put us in a pretty good position entering 2012. And for the first 3 months of 2012, in essence, the first quarter, we've been sending out renewals between 6% and 7%. To give you some perspective, last year at the same time, we sent them out between 5% and 5.5%. So we're pretty encouraged and is part of the positioning that we did in the fourth quarter as we entered into 2012.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And what are you seeing these days in terms -- as you hit the first part of the year in terms of foot traffic? Are you seeing this sort of normal pickup in foot traffic or is it still slow, et cetera?","Leo S. Horey","Well, I mean, foot traffic in the fourth quarter was up about 10% over the previous year, Rob, and we're seeing it maintain those patterns in January.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then lastly, Tim, I mean, you guys added a bunch to the development pipeline. Nothing is falling out although there's going to be some from falling out on completions here in early '12. What's your sort of tolerance at this point given what you see from economy for the upper end of the portfolio of the development side? Would you go up to $2 billion at this point?","Timothy J. Naughton","Rob, yes, certainly, we'd go up to $2 billion. In fact, we expect the year to end with around $2 billion. I think, as we mentioned on the previous calls, we're geared to do about $1 billion a year right now. As Tom had mentioned, we expect to do -- start upwards of $1.2 billion this year on top of around $900 million last year. The average community has a production cycle of around 8 or 9 quarters so that, just by math, it gets you to $2 billion, maybe a little bit north of that. And put it in perspective, that's close to what it was at the peak in 2007. However, then it was up 20% of total market cap. At the end of this year, just based on current market cap, that $2 billion will only represent about 13% of total market cap, so about 2\/3 of what it was before. Ultimately, our tolerance is going to be gauged by a number of things. One, just the obvious around just balance sheet in terms of how much in unfunded commitments we want to tolerate. And the more that we put in the pipeline, the more conservative we will be about liquidity and how we're positioning that balance sheet. But then also, just in terms of the economics, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the stuff that is currently in due diligence or in the development portfolio continues to look attractive to us. And so that's probably as big of a driver as anything else, just the relative economics of that business relative to what you can buy at so -- Tom, did you have something you want to add?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Yes, Rob, I just want to follow up. We have 37,470 apartments in the total stabilized basket, which includes same-store and other stabilized. You mentioned the 6,000 or 7,000 units in other stabilized. We don't expect any change in the same-store basket, any meaningful change between years because of asset sales, but also just the normal things that come out of the same-store basket when you redevelop an asset. So virtually no change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jana Galan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You mentioned that you're at a higher occupancy starting out this year. How are you thinking about turnover? And are there any of your markets where you think they'll trend up and maybe do more towards homeownership?","Leo S. Horey","With respect to general turnover for the year, I expect it to go back to more normalized levels. So for instance, in 2010, it was about 52%. I believe one of the attachments indicated that in 2011, it was 53%, budgeted between -- we budgeted between 54% and 55%. So that's what we're expecting for turnover. As far as the reasons for move out go, the area that we've been discussing a lot and focusing our time on is -- especially as we're pushing renewal rents so aggressively, what percentage are people -- of our turnover is related to financial or rent increase. For the quarter, the fourth quarter, that ran about 16%, which is above the historical average but has actually come down from about 19% in the third quarter. We've also been watching pretty carefully what's going on with move out to home purchase. Last quarter, that was about 13%. I believe it moved up to about 15%, still well below the historical average that has run in excess of 20%.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I was just curious whether any of the apartment communities in Fund I could be potential Eaves candidates?","Timothy J. Naughton","Jana, it's Tim Naughton. It's not our expectation that they would be converted to Eaves, just given the limited hold period of most of those assets. We only have 2 or 3 years left on the hold period on Fund I.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Bragg of Zelman & Associates.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Leo, you alluded to this as it relates to 4Q, but could you tell us specifically what did you achieve in terms of increases on renewals and new move-ins in the quarter?","Leo S. Horey","Sure. Across the portfolio in the fourth quarter, renewals were about 5%, and new move-in rents were up about 1.5% to 2%.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. And then, that just brings out the topic of looking back to the second half of 2011 and in the hopes of better understanding your outlook for 2012. Thinking back to June, you updated your revenue growth guidance to 5.0% to 5.75% range for the full year. At the time, you essentially had the first half of the year in the books. And now that you're coming in at the low end of that range for the year, can you just talk in general about how the second half of the year played out as compared to your expectations back in June for the midpoint or the high end of that range? It seems as though pricing power was meaningfully less, but I want to understand if that would be attributed to new move-ins or renewals or specific markets?","Timothy J. Naughton","Dave, this is Tim. Maybe I can jump in there. We did -- as you recall, we did increase our guidance last year to about 5.3% to 5.4% at the midpoint. In terms of revenue, it came in a bit less than that. I think at that time, I've indicated we expected the fourth quarter to be up close to 7% same-store revenue on a year-over-year basis, and it came in around 6.2%. So the delta there was around 75 basis points. I wouldn't attribute it to either new move-ins or renewals. Obviously, new move-ins have been a little weaker. I think it's just really a function of what happened in the economy in the summer. And as we talked about, we thought -- on our prior calls, we thought the slowdown we saw at the year end was not just seasonal, but we did think there was a macroeconomic aspect to it as well. But we started to see some improvement here at the end of the year going into the beginning of the year, as Tom mentioned in some of his prepared comments and Leo referenced in what we're seeing in renewals in the first 3 months of the year.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. So then, therefore, it sounds like your view is that, that pricing power has been deferred into 2012?","Timothy J. Naughton","It's our view that the fundamentals have improved again, not just in terms of a seasonal basis, but also some of what we're expecting just from a pure macroeconomic demand and supply standpoint.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. And last question, specific to your transaction activity plans. Can you talk about the expected spread between acquisition and disposition cap rates, especially in light of the fact that you do have the heightened focus on class B?","Leo S. Horey","Sure, Dave. We -- as Tom mentioned, we're expecting to be close to net neutral, maybe a little -- maybe net positive by about $100 million. We have identified most of the assets that we intend to sell next year. Some of them were some of the higher cap rate assets. To be honest, they're strategic sales. They're sales -- they're assets that either where we're looking to trim a position in a market or we think their growth potential isn't as great as the balance of the portfolio. So even though we may be buying more B assets, they're likely to be -- it's likely to be weighted a little bit more on the West Coast and dispositions are likely to be weighted a little bit more on the East Coast.  So we're actually anticipating a bit of dilution through the -- through acquisitions and dispositions on the order of 25 to 40 basis points.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe at Citi.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Obviously, with it being pretty early in the year, you're giving your guidance now without having the benefit of knowing what your peak leasing is going to shape up. So I guess, I'm curious about how aggressive are your assumptions thinking about going into those summer months? Are you expecting growth to accelerate into those summer months, or would you expect it to hold flat or potentially decelerate?","Leo S. Horey","Eric, this is Leo. Obviously, we expect improvement in both new move-in and renewal rents. What we've seen in the past -- we've seen in the past 2 years, is from -- basically January through August, we've gotten some pretty substantial increases in both new move-in and renewal rents. And then toward the back half of the year, as we gone into the slower leasing season, we've given some of that back. To give you some perspective, over the past couple of years, new move-in rents, the absolute rents have moved 10% to 12% to 13% from January through August. And then in that -- from that period to the end of the year, we've given back typically about 5%.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, Tim, I think the last time we talked at NAREIT, you mentioned that in 50% of your markets, it was more expensive to rent than own. In what markets in particular are you seeing those affordability numbers become a little bit stretched? And I guess, how long do you think you can continue to push rents in those particular markets before people just finally make that purchase decision?","Timothy J. Naughton","Eric, I think the answer to that second question is probably somewhat unknowable, just given the interplay of confidence and where we're at in terms of the mortgage business right now, in terms of the discipline that it continues to impose on the market in terms of the kind of down payment it's requiring. In terms of the markets where we've started to see a little heightened increase in move outs related to home purchases, it's been mostly in the Northeast, actually, Boston, Long Island. We've seen it start to creep back up towards longer-term trends, even though for the portfolio overall, it's quite a bit below. And the markets where it appears to be most affordable are the Mid-Atlantic\/Midwest, which has generally always been the case, but increasingly in some of the other Northeastern markets, Boston and Long Island and Fairfield.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And I guess as you think about what's actually best for the apartment business for the next couple of years, so what you're hoping to happen, are you rooting for the housing industry to recover? Are you thinking that it's actually better if home ownership rates continue to drop?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, I think we would take 5% to 6% revenue growth for as long as the eye can see so -- but that can't last forever based upon the dynamics under which it's happened. Right? It's our sense that if the housing market recovers, the for-sale housing market recovers, the factors that would have to be in place for that to happen are going to be good for the entire economy, including rental housing. It's hard to imagine it's going to happen without a decent increase in consumer confidence, without a decent increase in job growth, without just general, just household -- growth in general. And so we think those factors are likely to be good for rental housing as well. And just remember, I mean, we went from the mid-90s to the mid-2000s, where homeownership rates went from 64% to 69%. And the industry did pretty well, particularly in the '90s where you had -- we had a sustained period of economic growth. So it's not -- that's not a scenario we necessarily fear for the -- particularly for the apartment industry, particularly when you consider -- we think the impact is going to largely be absorbed by the single-family rental business, not necessarily multi-family rental.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derek Bower, UBS.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just wanted to get back to the 6% to 7% range on renewals. Was that asking or what you're achieving for February and March?","Leo S. Horey","Derek, this is Leo. That's what we have sent out, the offers that we've sent out. And obviously, if they move in a pretty broad range where they could be well above that or they could below it, the ultimate number is going to depend on the level -- what leases are renewed. We've seen it range from -- I mean, last year, I threw out 5% to 5.5%, and that's what it actually came in at. But it could range anywhere from no decline, like we saw last year in the first quarter, to up to 100 basis points less, depending on whether people took the less aggressive offers and didn't take the more aggressive offers that we put out. So if I had to give you a range, let's say, 50 basis points is the erosion that you might see off that. But it could range anywhere from 0 to 100 basis points.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And I guess with occupancy now at the 96% mark, what are your expectations for new rents to trend in 1Q? And could we see new rents cross new renewals by the end of the year -- I mean, sorry, by midyear?","Leo S. Horey","Derek, to give you some perspective, absolutely, we will push new move-in rents aggressively. Generally, what you find is new move-in rents move much more -- at much more volatility in them. By the middle of 2011, new move-in rents were right on top of renewal rents, and they can certainly go past as long as the market dynamics stay favorable.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And just lastly, could you just provide a little bit more color on the timing of the acquisitions later for this year? Is that just a function of having something that you're currently underwriting but you think may take a little longer to get done?  Or are you just not seeing anything overly attractive today with the expectation that maybe a deal may come to market later in the year?","Timothy J. Naughton","Derek, it's Tim Naughton here. Yes, transactions generally are backloaded in the second half of the year anyway as companies oftentimes start to put kind of their plans together in the first quarter, and you start to see a pickup or close in the second quarter. It's not -- we're not -- it's not backloaded because we have deals under contract that we think are going to take several months to get closed. It's really -- that's where we're -- that's sort of the place holder and the budget is just more in the back half of the year based upon what we're seeing right now in terms of activity. We're starting to see -- we're just starting to see the pickup in listing activity. We do think transaction volume will be up significantly again this year. In '11, it was up about 35% over '10, still below long-term trends. But just based upon chatter in the brokerage community, most brokers are expecting to see 30% to 35% growth again this year just based upon their discussions with the client -- with their clients, but  a lot of it coming in the, call it, the last 7, 8 months of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a question for Leo. The fact that the renewal notices are going out at a higher level than they were this time last year, as you're thinking about this sort of January to August time frame, does that give you some level of confidence that rent growth towards sort of the peak leasing season could reach or exceed where you guys were at that time last year? Or does the comparison issues start to come into play at that point?","Leo S. Horey","I think both factors are at play Karin. Clearly, we're going to bump up against some more difficult comparables. But certainly, the results that we're seeing early in the year are very encouraging, and I can assure you that we will continue to push as aggressively as possible to maximize that revenue stream.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And second question is, can you remind us what percentage of your residents are employed directly in financial services? And have you seen any sign either in New York or San Francisco or any markets seeing any indication that residents are seeing some weakness in that -- layoffs in the banking industry and that's affecting their ability to pay rent?","Leo S. Horey","Karin, this is Leo. Across the entire portfolio, it runs about 9% to 10%. More specifically, in the New York area, it runs about 30%. It can vary anywhere from 10% to almost 50% at various communities. We have not seen any major change. Certainly, we're watching for it because of all the press, but we haven't seen any change. One of the things that has been encouraging is in New York Metropolitan area. Certainly, the technology sector seems to be taking on or moving into that area in a way that can certainly benefit us.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then last question, just on the expense side. Is the relatively mild winter and snowless winter, particularly in the Northeast, having a positive benefit on your operating expenses so far in the first quarter?","Leo S. Horey","Well, we haven't gotten any results for January yet, but I can tell you that I am rooting for 65 degrees straight throughout the year. And certainly, early indications are that this winter should help our operating expenses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky at RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You gave the renewal statistics for January, February and March. Just curious as to the guidance that you guys provided. What is the scenario you guys are assuming for full year renewal growth, as well as new lease rate growth in there? And then also, if you look at where the portfolio today compares, be it on a loss to lease spaces, how far off are in-place rents versus market?","Leo S. Horey","Mike, this is Leo. We don't have that disaggregated for the entire year. And frankly, since we went on to LRO, because market rents move in such a volatile way, a lost lease isn't something that we focus on. We focus more on what is the direction of absolute rent and what is the year-over-year percent change that we're seeing in both new move-ins and renewals as we've been discussing.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can you give us that statistic then for new leases then through the year to date so far?","Leo S. Horey","Right now through January, new leases are running about 2%. And so that you know, both new move-in and renewal rents on an absolute basis turned positive in December. It started moving forward in a positive trend, which is ahead of what occurred last year. That took until February for that really to start to occur last year.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Second, Tom, you walked us a little bit through expense guidance for 2012. Can you give us a sense of what you're budgeting for real estate taxes and a couple of the areas there?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Leo is going to take the real estate tax expense question.","Leo S. Horey","Sure. What's driving our expense forecast is really insurance and taxes. And to give you perspective, real estate taxes is kind of in the 5.5%, 6% range, and insurance is closer to 13%. In both of those cases, we had a lot but there's denominator effect there in that we were very successful, obviously, with tax appeals, which is why 2011 came in favorable, and then we had some success with insurance claims. All other categories, payroll, all those other categories, really are going to be somewhere between 0% and 1%. So it's really being driven by the 2 categories of insurance and taxes.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Third and final question, can you talk a little bit about your growth expectations for Northeast and Mid-Atlantic versus the West Coast in 2012?","Leo S. Horey","Sure. This is Leo again. I would kind of bracket our growth expectations in 3 different areas. First, I'd put Northern California in a 7% to 8% range. And then on the other end of the spectrum, while still healthy and positive, I'd put D.C. around 4%. And then the remainder of our regions are around our average, call it 5.5% to 6%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew McCulloch from Green Street Advisors.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Tim, a question on the branding initiative. Do you expect the new brands to have any positive impact on rent at all? Or are the benefits you're seeing mostly going to be internal, given that it helps climb kind of your operating and external growth strategies?","Timothy J. Naughton","Andy, I think it's our hope over time that we'll be able to drive rents by providing a very differentiated product to the marketplace. But as much as anything, there's an internal benefit, as you alluded to in your question, in terms of not just what you put in the product, but what you don't. And we are finding, increasingly with the Avalon brand, that it's still, as I mentioned, the core brand. And we try to have it appeal to a broader base of customers that, in a sense, we're asking it to do too much. And you're starting to get a little bit feature creep to build -- that gets built in over time where that marginal customer may not be valuing the set of features and amenities you may be providing and therefore, you may be over spec-ing  it. So we think it's -- there's going to be a benefit in terms of hopefully skewing it over indexing towards the target segment that will value appropriately what you're bringing into the market, but then also that you're not over spec-ing  what you are bringing into the market.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And then on the acquisition environment, I'm sure you're following the Archstone saga very closely. After the current bidding process played itself out, do you expect to get a shot at some of those assets at some point in the near future as whoever the eventual owner is begins to rightsize that portfolio?","Timothy J. Naughton","I have no idea. I have no idea. Ultimately, it depends on who the eventual owner is, I suppose.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","One last question. Can you give us an update on the market for land and whether your recent purchases there are entitled or unentitled?","Timothy J. Naughton","Sure. I'm not sure about the ones we just closed on. I think that those are pretty much all entitled. I think those are all entitled. But in general, I think we've talked about in the last few quarters, the land markets have gotten a bit more competitive, particularly on the entitled deals, as institutional capital was sort of anxious to put capital work and new development, just given the fundamentals that were playing out in 2011 and '12. What we're starting to see is those entitled deals have largely cleared the market, in our markets anyway. And our focus, I think, has really been paying off and focusing increasingly in 2011 on deals that require some perceived cost investment. In fact, we increased our development right pipeline by about $1.2 billion worth of new development in 2011, over 18 deals. And I would say of those 18 deals, 11 of them required a fairly significant entitlement work, 7 of which were largely entitled.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Actually, if I could build on that last question. I'm curious, are landholders willing to let you guys cost-effectively option land today or are they getting more stringent on trying to get you to buy it outright?","Timothy J. Naughton","We're not seeing really any pressure to buy it on an unentitled basis yet. The one reason that's always been a bit of a struggle with that, tug-o-war with that is in Southern California, where land historically has traded more frequently on an unentitled basis. But virtually, in all of our other markets, we're getting the requisite time we need to get through the entitlement period during the option period.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And is it a fairly deep, I guess I'll call it, market of opportunity? But also, I guess, you touched on it but how deep is the competition you face at the same time?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, in terms of the offerings that have been brought to the market, that has expanded, I would say, in the last 6 to 9 months. And eventually, we've put over $1 billion of new development rights on the board here over the last year. I'd tell you, we were focused on in 2010 as well. And there just weren't that many opportunities and there were even fewer people out there looking for them. So the markets have started to open up a bit, and there's definitely more competition. But our sense is it's not -- we're talking about 2 or 3 guys we're often competing with on these deals that require some pursuit cost capital, and the landowners are still putting a lot of -- a big premium on sponsorship and track record, particularly for something that are going to get 2 or 3 years to go out and get the entitlements.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I know we still have rents growing, but do you have a sense or do you have a feeling for what the signals are that you'd looked for, for when you might pull back from acquiring land or do you think that's a ways off?","Timothy J. Naughton","It's something that we have talked a fair bit about. One, is just price, right? How much has land recovered in? And on the entitled deals, we have seen a pretty full recovery, again, something where you can get in the ground in 3 to 6 months, deals that are 2 to 3 years to entitle. We're not seeing it. We're really not seeing values anywhere close to peak for the most part, so that's still a good sign. And then the normal metrics we look at in terms of the economics and total costs to have actually develop a deal. I mean, how we feel about that basis relative to where assets are trading, as well as what the yields look like relative to acquisition cap rates. And the signals there are still generally positive, I'd say, as it relates to land.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then the just last question or so was, now that you're developing and redeveloping around the AVA and Eaves brands, can you talk a little bit about maybe the tangible differences that exist between those products and maybe even differences in the return profiles that you guys underwrite for them?","Timothy J. Naughton","Sure. I'm not sure that there's a big difference in return profile because we don't necessarily see one being riskier than the other. But other than Eaves, it's largely through -- likely to be largely through acquisition, which is going to be subject to acquisition cap rates in the market. But in terms of the product, the Avalon I think people are generally familiar with, upscale, high-end to manage, et cetera, but AVA is really geared towards that younger age cohort who want to accept more sort of transitioning neighborhoods. They want urban. They went active. They want transit, but they'll take something that's a little edgier. In terms of service, they want -- they're looking for staff that's knowledgeable, that's sort of, \"of the neighborhood.\" But looking for sort of casual and the fact that dress, that associates that work on the property, at least at the office level. It's more of kind of an urban casual dress code as opposed to the pressed and polished you might expect to see at an Avalon community. Conversely, at Eaves, it's -- the service model there is more sort of friendly, welcoming, respectful, if you will. The dress there is probably more like business casual as opposed to an urban casual, the pressed and polished, likely to be more in suburban bedroom communities. As I mentioned, sort of older assets where residents are looking for sort of mature locations, safe neighborhoods, but where they put a big emphasis on value or generally looking for something that works, that practical. Fitness room is fine. It doesn't need to be a spa-like exercise facility, but they do expect it to work. They do expect it to be neat. They do expect to be treated with respect.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Is it fair to say that the launch of the AVA brand kind of will increase your development opportunities set then because, obviously, those markets probably couldn't have sustained to fall on Avalon products in the past?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, I think that's absolutely a fair statement. We already have several in the pipeline that I'm not sure we would have positioned as an Avalon community. And I guess the other part of it, we think it can strengthen Avalon. We have at least 4 communities we have identified that will be some combination of Avalon and AVA, where there are 2 very different consumer experiences, different lobbies, different offices, in some cases different amenities, but very different unit plans, et cetera. And it allows us to go after maybe, say, a larger deal than we otherwise might have been comfortable with just under one brand. An example of that is the West Chelsea deal, which is roughly evenly split between the Avalon and the AVA brand, both in the 350-unit neighborhood, if you will, as opposed to just doing one large 700-unit Avalon or AVA deal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jade Teng [ph] with Real Estate Buyers [ph].","Unknown Analyst","I'd like to find out how much capital the company used for acquisitions during 2011?","Timothy J. Naughton","I'm not sure we have that right in front of us here, but most of it was through the -- through our Second Investment Management Fund. And I want to say, it was on the order of what we did this year around -- or what we're anticipating doing this coming year, around the $300 million in acquisitions -- through acquisitions. And then we had a -- we also had an asset exchange with another REIT. That represented about another $250 million in volumes. So it ends up being in the -- I want to say in the $500 million to $550 million range, which is about what we're expecting in 2012, just to expect to capitalize it differently, given the end of investment period for our second fund having occurred in 2011.","Unknown Analyst","Great. And also, I'd like to find out as far as the fair value added fund, is that in the works or something we expect with that?","Thomas J. Sargeant","This is Tom Sargeant. We are currently not in the market for a third fund. We have certain portfolio objectives that we want to execute on. And it's a lot easier to execute those portfolio reshaping efforts without a partner and a joint venture partner. Having said that, we do like the fund business. We've had a good experience with it, and we've made money for our investors. And it's something we wouldn't rule out, but we have no current plans to market a third fund.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And finally, my last question for you concerns the Eaves brand and also the drilling into the suburban and veteran communities. I'm wondering which regions the company would be most interested in? The places where you've stated about the growth, and it seems like Northern California would be a prime markets with what you're talking. Will you be looking for that?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, I think I got most of that. You're breaking up there right at the end. But in terms of markets where we're most interested in, at least initially, as it relates to converting some of our existing assets, there'll be more -- actually, in California, both Northern and Southern California. As I mentioned, they're likely to -- they're more likely to be sort of older, vintage assets, if you will, which our portfolio is just older in both Northern and Southern California. So initially, in terms of what we're redeveloping and reflagging, it will be weighted towards the West Coast, in particular, the California markets. Over time, we expect to have a mix -- a broad mix across really all of our regions, maybe a little less so as it relates to Northeast just given the depth of our pipeline, our development pipeline there and our heritage and our ability to -- and track record to create a lot of value through new development particularly in that region. So that region maybe a little bit more weighted towards Avalon and AVA over time.","Unknown Analyst","But I mean, in terms of new acquisitions, the class B product, which regions would the company be most interested in?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, I think again probably all of our regions, but maybe weighted more towards the West. I think as we grow the portfolio on the West Coast, it's got to be somewhat balanced between development and acquisitions, which sets up nicely for some additional Eaves product there. On the East Coast, it'll be probably a little bit more weighted towards new development, which bodes for stronger growth in Avalon and AVA. But we still intend to grow through acquisitions, as well as converting some of our existing portfolio in the East Coast to Eaves as well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Your next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Are you seeing any increase in move-outs in response to rental rate increases? And are you still able to backfill with higher income or better credit quality tenants? And also, as you think about rent-to-income ratios, do you think the ceilings of those could be different between the 2 tenant bases that you're targeting in the 2 branding initiatives?","Leo S. Horey","Paula, this Leo. With respect to reasons for move-out related to rent increase or financial, for the fourth quarter, it ran about 16%. That was down about 3% from the third quarter where it was 19%. But to put it in perspective, that is above the long-term average, which is more in the 8% to 10% range. With respect to income, the income -- the average income for new move-ins in the fourth quarter was about $112,000. That's up about 6% from the same period of the previous year, so we feel pretty good about that. And with respect to rent-to-income, our rent-to-income ratio remains around 19.5%. I will tell you that in the '08 period, it peaked more 21%, 22%, so there's still room there, plus we do expect through the information that we're getting would suggest that incomes will continue to rise in 2012, giving us room in both areas, both in the percentage of income designated to rent, as well as the growth in incomes, which should be positive for us. With respect to a split between As and Bs, I don't see any big issue there, no.","Timothy J. Naughton","Paula, maybe just to add to that. I guess, if we -- I guess we would expect that maybe Eaves would maybe a little bit higher than the average in terms of the percentage of income that they're spending on rent in that they're generally going to be lower, more moderate income. And they're going to be spending a greater percentage of their income on necessities, whether it's housing or healthcare or school whereas in the Avalon communities, we have just more discretionary renters and more discretionary income. And they're going to be spending their income on a broader mix of types of consumptions. So there's not a big difference up and down the income scale as we alluded to, but it's -- there's 100, 200 basis points here and there from higher to more moderate income, typically, is what we see.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's helpful. And on redevelopment investment, what average rental rate pop are you expecting?","Timothy J. Naughton","It really varies. I mean, what's typical is around $150 and -- but what we focused on really is the return on enhancements and return on total capital. A typical deal, say, may have $30,000 in total improvements of that, 50% or 60% of that maybe in enhancements, 40% to 50% of that maybe in the end of user life type components. And we'll typically see a return on enhancements, 12%, 13%, 14%, and a return on total capital at maybe 7% or 8%.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And on the development side, are you seeing any delays anywhere in your ability to just get through the municipality process because the staffs are overloaded like we've reading about here in Fairfax County?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, it's a good question. It's one we're a bit concerned about. We've had 1 or 2 deals where permitting has been delayed. I'm not sure that it's been a result of staffing as much as just unique aspects of those deals, or maybe a little bit of turnover in the building department office. But it hasn't become acute by any means, but it's something we're keeping an eye out because it is a concern looking forward.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then just finally, what drove the cost savings on the development projects in 2011 that you mentioned in your press release? Was that mostly labor or something else? Relative to your initial budgets, I mean.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, I think -- well, one, typically, we've been able to get buyout savings, and we generally let that flush through contingency. And we've been able to save more contingency and get more buyout savings than we have in the past. And what we are seeing in 2010 and -- it was 2010 when we were starting those deals, we're getting a lot of bid coverage around a certain number. And that was -- and that's where we set our budgets to. And then when you actually went out to actually buy it, you could get -- you could extract even a bigger price concession than we typically have been able to see in the past and kind of that last pricing discussion that you have with the subcontractor. So it's really been a combination of that, being able -- just having more leverage with the subs in terms of how we've been able to manage change orders and contingencies that -- and I mean, just the fine work of our construction group.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ren of MorningStar Research.","Jason Ren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could give just a little bit more color on how rental income has grown across your various geographies? I understand it's up 6%, but is there a difference between -- I mean, how close is the difference in -- from one geography to another? And I was also wondering if you could give us a little bit more granularity as to where the rent-to-income ratios are stacking up in your various markets as opposed to the consolidated figure?","Leo S. Horey","Just to give you -- Jason, this is Leo. It doesn't vary too dramatically from market to market. It's the truth. I mean, the high might be in the low 20-point-something, 20.2, 20.3. With respect to incomes, the incomes vary from Southern California in the low $90s to the Northeast, the New York Metro area where it might be as much as $130k. So that's kind of how it ranges. But as my previous comment indicated, it kind of ties back to the rent levels. So the percentages remain fairly constant and fairly consistent from region to region. Obviously, to go from Southern California being in the low $90,000 range to the Metro New York area, which is about $130,000, there is a fairly large range there. To give you some indication of where there's been more significant changes, and this is looking at fourth quarter of 2011, the fourth quarter of 2010, in the New England area, which is Boston and Connecticut, incomes were up 10%, similar in Southern California. Whereas in the Pacific Northwest for that one quarter, it was just slightly down, a couple of percentage points down on a year-over-year basis. So hopefully, that gives you some perspective from region to region and also answers your question about rent-to-income ratios.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, I tried to get off though. My questions were answered.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Andrew Schafer [ph] of Sandler O'Neill.","Unknown Analyst","Going back to real estate taxes, I was trying to get a better feel of what percent of this is going to be attributable to the 421-A burn-off in New York?","Leo S. Horey","None. I don't think any of it is attributable to the 421-A.  To give you a perspective, because I have looked at it, the place where we're seeing the high -- the most pressure on property taxes is in the Washington D.C. Metropolitan area, and that's occurring both in rate and assessments. Obviously, California is constrained, so that works to our benefit. And the rest of the markets are more in the 5% range, kind of in the averages.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, Andrew, just to add a little color to that. Most of our assets, we built in New York and are still within their abatement period. So we're not in that during the phase out, if you will, with the -- of the burn-off of that abatement yet.","Unknown Analyst","And then I was wondering at what markets specifically you got the successful appeals in terms of the refunds?","Leo S. Horey","Give me just a sec, and I'll tell you where we've had success. In the fourth quarter, they came in Massachusetts and Southern and Northern California. And then year to date, you would add New Jersey and Maryland were the places where we had success in the appeals.","Timothy J. Naughton","Maybe just to add to that, just briefly. Where we've seen successes on some of the lease-ups that we had in -- during the downturn, 2009, 2010, where assessors would hit you up with something based maybe on cost but values were actually -- may have been less than cost in certain cases. And it just takes a while, 1 year or 2 oftentimes for those appeals to resolve themselves. So naturally [ph], we benefited a lot in 2011.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And finally, I just want to make sure that for your same-store 2012 guidance off -- kind of basing off of 2011, yet you're moving the full year effect of Rock Spring so the tempo -- with the guided number is kind of a pure comp.","Thomas J. Sargeant","This is Tom, Andrew. We only had 3 quarters of the negative drag from Rock Spring in 2011, so you don't see the full benefit on Rock Spring in 2012. Roughly, if you were just to think about it, we had 3 quarters of excess expense and release payments, which was about -- it's $10 million, full year. It's $7.5 million for those 3 quarters, so that goes away. What also goes away, there was the NOI from that asset, which was cash flowing nicely on a cash flow basis. We had a pretty good yield. So we do lose that NOI. And until we reinvest that capital, that somewhat is a drag. So we're going to pick up $7.5 million or $0.075 per share between years. But once you factor out the NOI loss, it's more like a $0.04 pickup between years. And so I think, it's a lease that we're happy to go away, but we're not really picking up as much as you might think, given the magnitude of the excess expense and release payments.","Unknown Analyst","So when you sort of projecting out for your guidance 2012, so you're keeping that in your base 2011 assumption - full year numbers?","Thomas J. Sargeant","I'm sorry, I don't understand that last question.","Unknown Analyst","Looking forward, so that full year -- the 3-quarter effect in your 2011 analyze, you're not removing that and then...","Thomas J. Sargeant","Yes, correct. We're not removing that, it's just you don't get a full year impact in '12 because you only had 3 quarters of 2011 dragging you.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Naughton.","Timothy J.

There's a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.","As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our first quarter call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin, and Matt Birenbaum. We'll each provide some comments on the slides that we posted this morning, and then be available for Q&A afterwards.","Our comments will include a summary of the Q1 results. We'll highlight a few areas of focus that we discussed in connection with the Archstone acquisition that closed a couple of years ago, but are now starting to pay off for the company, including an increased presence in Southern California, greater efficiencies from increased scale and expansion, enhancement of important strategic capabilities. Lastly, we'll touch on the development funding and activity.","Starting on slide 4. Overall results in Q1 were largely as expected for our business plan and we're off to a strong start as we enter the peak leasing season this spring and summer. Highlights for the quarter include core FFO growth of around 7.5%, which was consistent with what we saw in Q4 of last year. Same-store revenue growth was up 4.3% over Q1 of last year or 4.4% when you include redevelopment, which are both about 20 basis points higher than we saw in Q4.","We completed three communities, totaling $450 million this past quarter at an initial yield of just over 6%. And while that yield is a bit lower than other recent completions, 60% of that capital represents West Chelsea and Manhattan where cap rates have been in the low 3% range, and the other 40% are assets in LA and Seattle where cap rates are currently in the 4% to 4.5% range. So we are still seeing a significant level of NAV accretion from these completions with margins that have been consistent with the other completions this cycle.","We also started two communities in Q1, totaling about $100 million, and we backfilled the pipeline with new development rights of over $400 million or roughly $200 million once you net out projects we decided to abandon at the end of last year.","Moving on and turning to slide 5. Our same-store portfolio has continued to accelerate in early 2015. Year-over-year same-unit rent is up 5% to 6% in the first four months of the year, faster pace than we saw in Q4 and roughly 250 basis points to 300 basis points higher than the same period last year. This is actually the strongest rent growth we've seen in the first quarter of the year over the last couple of cycles.","So the portfolio is well positioned going into the peak leasing season, with renewal offers for May and June actually going out in the mid to high 7% range. Clearly, strong portfolio performance is being driven by healthy apartment fundamentals, which takes us to slide 6. As you can see, over the last several quarters, and I'm sure you know, job growth has been north of 2% nationally, or over 260,000 jobs per month. And it's been even stronger in the young adult cohort of 25-year-olds to 34-year olds who are our prime renters, as you can see there, on the upper right on chart two.","More recently, household formation appears to be rebounding, as you can see in chart three, perhaps showing signs of the release of pent-up demand that many have been expecting since the recovery began. The strong demands against a backdrop of stable housing production over the last several quarters, at least in the multi-family sector, as you can see in chart four, is resulting in rental vacancies that are approaching 30-year lows, as chart five shows. And effective rental rate growth that is at or above what we saw early in the cycle. So we've seen a really nice acceleration really going back to Q4 of 2013 in effective rent growth.","Turning to slide 7. Strong fundamentals are expected to be more evenly enjoyed across our footprint over the next couple of years of the cycle. Over the past four years, as you can see on the left hand graph, the West has outperformed significantly, driven by strong job and income growth in the technology markets of Northern California and Seattle, while supply has been modest in most markets, particularly in the Bay Area.","Over the next couple of years, we expect job growth to be more evenly distributed as more parts of the economy join in on the economic expansion. Secondly, we do expect supply to increase in Seattle and Northern California and, as a result, performance differences between regions should begin to narrow, including in the D.C. area where performance has lagged over the last couple of years. Conversely, Southern California is projected to enjoy the largest disparity in favorable demand greater than new supply over the next couple of years.","Turning to slide 8. This expectation for regional performance to narrow as the cycle matures, this is consistent with what we've seen historically where the West has generally outperformed early in the cycle during the recovery and early expansion periods. And then performance often converges with East Coast markets as the cycle matures.","To be clear, we're not calling the top to the West. It's just that we expect performance trends to begin to narrow between the East and West as we move further into the cycle, and inevitably relative market performance will ebb and flow and market leadership will rotate. As I mentioned before, for example, the D.C. should begin to rise from the bottom and narrow the performance gap we've seen with other regions, and Southern California should become a top performer in the portfolio.","With that, that's probably a good segue to talk a little bit more about Southern California, and I'd like to ask Matt to touch on our efforts over the last couple of years and how we expect that to bear fruit over the next few years. So, Matt?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Thanks, Tim. As we mentioned at the time that we announced the Archstone transaction back in late 2012, the Archstone acquisition really helped us achieve our long-term portfolio allocation goals. Slide 9 shows how the geographic distribution of our NOI across our six regions has changed over the past two years, primarily as a result of the addition of the Archstone assets, but also due to lot of organic growth from the legacy AVB platform as our development activity ramps up early in the cycle.","The region that has seen the greatest growth is Southern California, which grew from 14.5% to 19.6% of consolidated NOI over the last two years. We have been under-allocated to this region for many years and had always been challenged to increase our exposure to the broadly diversified economy and consistent long-term performance that Southern California has delivered for us for decades. By growing our presence here, we were also able to decrease our relative allocations for the Northeast from 50% to 38% of our NOI, which provides better long-term balance.","Turning to slide 10, you can see how momentum has really been building in our Southern California portfolio over the past five quarters, with year-over-year revenue growth increasing each quarter. Right now, we are seeing market rents in all of the Southern California sub-regions accelerate into the 6% range on a year-over-year basis. We are well-positioned for another strong year of same-store revenue growth in Southern California, and that growth will contribute more to overall revenue growth for the company given our increased allocation to this region.","Looking more closely at where our portfolio growth has occurred across the region, slide 11 shows the locations of our communities with the size of the dots proportional to the size of each property. There are a lot of distinct submarkets within the sprawling geography of Southern California. We've increased our presence in all three of the sub-regions: Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Diego, with particular concentrations in the tri-cities area of Pasadena, Glendale, Burbank, and the 101 Corridor from Woodland Hills out to Thousand Oaks.","Of course, for us, it's a lot more exciting to see the actual product and to look at dots on a map, which is why we included slide 12 to give you a sense of the variety and quality of products we're adding to the portfolio in this region. The top row shows some of our larger stabilized assets, including Avalon Studio City, which is an 827-unit community acquired from Archstone located right next door to many of the production studios in Burbank.","The middle row features some of our recent redevelopments, including AVA Burbank, which is one of the oldest assets in the portfolio. This asset was originally constructed in 1961, but it's been completely transformed and energized by the introduction of the AVA brand. And the bottom row includes three of our current development communities, including Avalon West Hollywood, which is a real flagship property, which will feature a Trader Joe's grocery store in the ground floor and 294 apartments above right on Santa Monica Boulevard. We were aggressive about getting shovels in the ground early in this cycle and all of these development communities have a tremendous base at the current cap rates and current replacement costs.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks, Matt. At the time of the Archstone acquisition, we talked about some of the benefits of scale, namely G&A and operating efficiencies as well as the expansion enhancement of important strategic capabilities. Sean is going to take a few minutes to provide a few examples of what we've been able to achieve in these areas. Sean?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Tim. Shifting gears now, we thought it'd be helpful to talk a little bit about the efficiency and effectiveness of our operating platform and, maybe along the way, highlight some initiatives that will continue to enhance our operating performance in the future.","So starting with slide 13, these metrics reflect not only the benefits associated with our larger scale, but also our ability to deliver more cash flow per dollar of revenue generated from the portfolio over time. The chart on the left reflects our operating overhead, which includes G&A as a percentage of NOI both in 2007 and what's expected for 2015. While our portfolio NOI has increased about 250% from organic growth, new development and the Archstone acquisition, we've been able to contain operating overhead growth to about 20% of the rate of NOI expansion over the total eight-year period. The net result is that overhead is now only 7% of NOI, down about 500 basis points or 40% from 2007 levels.","The chart on the right reflects our same-store NOI margins in 2007 and what's projected for 2015. Margins have expanded by about 200 basis points over the last eight years to 70%, putting us essentially at the top of the multi-family sector. And when you think about our NOI margins, you really have to remember two important facts: first, we have not enhanced our margins by simply reshaping the portfolio, that is exiting lower rent markets and acquiring assets in the higher rent coastal markets. And second, rental rates declined during the financial crisis and economic downturn, which put pressure on operating margins. In fact, if you look at the rent levels today compared to where they were in 2007, the CAGR over the past eight years is only about 3%, which is well below current growth rates.","Moving now to slide 14, I thought I would highlight one or two initiatives that have made us more efficient and will continue to pay dividends in the future. This slide highlights a couple of the benefits associated with our recent investments in proprietary technology, specifically our prospect and resident portals. These new platforms came online mid last year and have enhanced not only the efficiency of our operating platform, but also provided a better product to our customers. Leads generated through our new prospect portal have increased by 300 basis points to 27% of all leads today. At the same time, our cost associated with other forms of Internet advertising has declined by about 28%.","In terms of the new resident portal, enhanced functionality has helped us become more efficient with certain back office functions. Online resident payments are now about 90% of total payments, up 12.5% since 2013, and maintenance requests or service requests received online are up to about 50% of all requests, which is an increase of two-third since 2013.","As you move on to slide 15, I'd like to share a few facts about our customer care center located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, which we view as the best in the business and a real competitive advantage for us. We have about 225 associates located at the center and about 70% of them take customer service calls and execute transactions that would have been done onsite at our communities in the past, for example, posting rent, processing move-outs, et cetera.","The cost per transaction is lower than it would have been at the communities because our highly trained customer care associates can handle a much greater volume than any one individual at a property, and these associates are continuously measured and monitored based on their efficiency and effectiveness of processing transactions. The remaining associates handle other corporate functions, accounts payable, cash management, payroll, et cetera.","So I'd highlight that we continue to expand our capabilities with the customer care center with a unique focus on functions that are scalable in a centralized environment, and for which we can reduce the cost per transaction by bringing it in-house. One example of a new capability is reflected in the chart on the right side of the slide, collections.","About two years ago, we developed a collections capability at the center, which is not easy, given the regulatory constraints across all the states within which we operate. We believed, however, that we can materially reduce the cost of collections if we did it ourselves. And if you fast forward to today, our team is currently collecting about 35% of our total bad debt in-house, which has resulted in a net benefit of about $2 million per year. The benefit reflects a reduced third-party collection fees or commissions that we would have paid, offset by the overhead associate with our collections team in Virginia Beach. We expect to realize an even greater benefit as we take on more of our bad debt collections in-house. And we also think there are additional opportunities to expand our capabilities as the customer care center will continue to leverage it through our advantage in the future.","So, hopefully, that provides an overview of some of our operational metrics and initiatives. And now I'll turn it back to Tim.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Sean. As Sean mentioned, we've been able to reduce cost significantly from the system over the last cycle. Part of that's from scale, but importantly part of it's from just reengineering, how we conduct and operate our business.","But lastly, I thought we'd just take a few minutes and highlight development activity and funding, which we believe together position us for outsized NAV and FFO growth over the next few years, while being able to maintain a very strong financial position. And Kevin, do you want to take this?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Thanks, Tim. Turing to slide16, we highlight the current performance of the five communities under construction that are in lease-up. As you can see from the slide, the performance of communities undergoing initial lease-up is quite strong and continues to exceed our original underwriting expectations.","Specifically for these five communities, which represent $455 million in total capital costs, the current weighted average monthly rent per home is $215 or about 9% above initial expectations. In terms of yield performance, the weighted average initial projected stabilized yield for these communities is projected at 6.9% or 60 basis points higher than our original projection of 6.3% for these communities.","Turning to slide 17. Our development activity remains well funded today. In fact, as of quarter-end, our development underway of $3.6 billion was completely match funded by the combination of $2.5 billion in capital spent to-date, plus over $1.1 billion from cash on hand, projected free cash flow, and our equity forward. As a result, funding risk for this investment activity is essentially eliminated while the opportunity to realize a substantial amount of value creation as these communities are stabilized has been locked in for our shareholders.","Turning to slide 18. This slide demonstrates more clearly how our being match funded on this investment activity leaves us exceptionally well-positioned from both the cash flow growth and credit perspective. In particular, the projected NOI from recently completed development and from development under construction totals about $225 million on an annualized basis, as shown in the chart on the left. This represents more than a 20% growth in our annualized adjusted EBITDA for the last quarter.","Moreover, to give insight on how this projected EBITDA growth enhances our leverage metrics, particularly given that no incremental capital is needed to complete construction, the chart on the right shows how our ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter would have declined from 5.9 times to 5.0 times, assuming this projected EBITDA from our development underway have been in place during the first quarter.","Of course, our actual net debt to adjusted EBTIDA will move up and down a bit over time as we start new projects and source new capital to fund these new projects. Therefore, this slide is not meant to communicate that our leverage is going to decrease to 5 times or that our target leverage is five times. In fact, our target range for this metric is between 5 times and 6 times. Instead, the purpose in showing this slide is to convey that unfunded commitments, which happen to be zero today but more often will be positive in the future, should be evaluated in tandem with the projected EBITDA growth from ongoing investment activity. And as we stand today, funding risk is very low on development underway and the profit opportunity is relatively high, reflecting two important attributes of our combined investment of funding strategy.","First, the fact that our investment activity is expected to be accretive both to earnings and balance sheet strength. Second, that this cycle continues to offer compelling value creation opportunities for a development focused apartment REIT, such as AvalonBay.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Tim.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. Obviously, we're off to a strong start in Q1 to the year. As expected, our stabilized portfolio continue to strengthen in the quarter, propelled by some of the strongest apartment market fundamentals we've seen over the last several cycles. The development portfolio is contributing meaningfully, as Kevin just spoke to, and providing additional earnings and NAV growth.","And importantly, I mean, actions that we took early and what we predicted would be a strong and durable cycle are paying off, including the starting and funding of over $5 billion of new development since 2010, acquiring another plus or minus $6 billion in stabilized and development assets in the Archstone transaction in late 2012, early 2013, and investing in important strategic capabilities, which are driving efficiencies and improving the scalability of our operating platform. All these actions are positioning us to take advantage of what we believe could be a long and sustained expansion period for the current apartment cycle and help us achieve outsized growth.","And with that, Augusta, we'd be happy to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from Nick Joseph of Citi.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. I'm trying to reconcile 1Q same-store revenue growth of 4.3%, the growth you saw in January and February. I think in early March at our conference, year-to-date same-store revenue growth was 4.4% to 4.5%. And then from the presentation, the March rent change actually accelerated in terms of the spread year-over-year from February. So what drove the reduction of growth for the quarter relative to where you were in early March?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Nick, this is Tim. You're correct. When we met at the Citigroup Conference, we gave a mid quarter update and we said our expectation would be we'd be at the top end of the range for the year, for the quarter being 4.4% to 4.5%. The reality is numbers like 4.34% and some of it's on the non-rental revenue side that gets rolled up at the end of the quarter. So really nothing is different than what we expected and anticipated in early March when we met \u2013 when we met and spoke with investors at your conference.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. So then in terms of D.C., it looks like the quarterly year-over-year growth was the strongest you've seen since mid 2013. Can you talk more about what you're seeing on the ground there and expectations for the rest of the year?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure, Nick, this is Sean. In terms of D.C., I mean from a broader perspective, it's certainly still a weak market relative to other markets and there's still a fair amount of supply coming online. The expectations for 2015 are still for supply growth somewhere in the mid 3% range, but what has improved certainly is job growth, it's now running closer to 1%. So it's in a position now where from a kind of macro perspective across the region, we're seeing some improvements.","And as you think about it in terms of the three markets: the District, Suburban Virginia, and Suburban Maryland, it does depend on the nature of your portfolio, whether it's higher price point, lower price point, and the distribution within the submarkets of each one of those markets. But for us at least, right now, D.C. is performing the best as producing slightly positive revenue growth in rent change. The two weaker markets are Suburban Virginia and Suburban Maryland, with Suburban Maryland being the weakest right now, particularly given all the deliveries that are coming through in Rockville, Bethesda, Chevy Chase, all in that area.","But if you look at it in terms of maybe trends from the first quarter to what we're seeing in the second quarter, first quarter rent change across the region overall is basically around flat. But as you move into the second quarter, it's trending slightly positive to the tune of about 100 basis points in terms of blended rent change. So we're seeing sort of that second derivative move positively, but at a relatively slow pace, and I'd say with still a fair amount of risk given the supply that's been delivered in the region relative to the anticipated job growth.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning. Your turnover continues to decline and you saw the first quarter homeownership rate drop below 64%. I was just wondering how long do you think you'll continue to see turnover decline, and how that's helping your expenses, and then any changes in reasons for move-outs?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure, Jana, this is Sean. In terms of predicting turnover, it's a little bit difficult to predict. It's really a function of, I'd say, job mobility, probably first and foremost, as well as choices in terms of within a local market what choices people have. They feel like they have more choices at the right price that influences turnover. And the reason I'd say that is relocation is still the top reason for move-outs and our portfolio runs around 20%, I think that's consistent with most REITs. So, as people are relocating for job reasons, et cetera, that really tends to influence the total amount of turnover.","And then on the other topics, home purchases are still running well below long-term averages in the range of 13% and has been pretty flat, not really moved much. It's down a little bit year-over-year, but not really moving the needle. And then the other reasons are really financial, including rent increases as well as intercommunity transfers, rent increases tends to run a little bit higher, closer to 16% to 18%. But at this point in the cycle, you expect it to be trending upwards. But in terms of actually predicting what turnover will be, it's a function of the macro variables that I've mentioned. And so we are not yet at a point where we are predicting it. But given what we're seeing across the portfolio as well as with housing and the single-family market and the production levels, it's not farfetched to assume that turnover will remain below historical averages for the next few quarters for sure.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sean, maybe just add to that. Jana, as Sean mentioned, move-outs and home purchase has been relatively stable. And it's been our expectation that homeownership rates are going to be stabilize roughly in this area in the 64%, 65% range. And so we don't really have a view that homeownership rates are going down meaningfully from here. It's been our view that you are going to see more of a balanced housing picture over the next few years as the housing markets continue to recover and a lot of that's being driven by some of the things we've been talking about, which is demographics and lifestyle behavior in terms of what type of housing choice best sort of fits the need of the emerging population. So we do expect it to be more balanced over the next few years.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And then just maybe on the Southern California expense savings this quarter seemed very impressive. I think some of that might have been benefiting from tax appeals, but maybe if you could talk to what else's in there?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. This is Sean. That's exactly right. The main benefit that came through in the first quarter was a successful appeal of an asset in Southern California and that represented the majority of what you're seeing there in terms of the expense change.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates.","Dan M. Oppenheim - Zelman & Associates","Great. Thanks very much. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit in terms of expectations for some of the pricing power, you talked about the best start in terms of rental growth here at the start of the year and also some prior cycles. As you think about the balance across the regions, do you think this accelerates further as the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast gradually improve here? How are you thinking about that overall in terms of the rental rate power?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. This is Sean. Just a few comments on that. From a macro perspective, certainly across the markets, pricing power is improving at this point. Tim alluded to the rent change in his prepared remarks, not only for the first quarter, which trended higher in each month of the first quarter, but also continue to trend higher into April, where on a blended basis, we're running at about the 6% range.","And, I guess, the way I'd describe it is we're seeing increased pricing power across all the markets, but the rate of acceleration is slightly different. The rate of acceleration is probably the strongest right now in Southern California as well as Northern California, those two markets. Northern California, obviously, has been a discussion point for several quarters now in terms of the momentum there. And it'll be interesting as we move later in the year and more supply comes online, particularly in the submarket of San Francisco, Northeast San Jose, whether that starts to throttle back a little bit of the pace in Northern California, which we saw a couple of years ago when we saw blocks of supply come through San Jose.","Southern California, job growth has certainly ramped up, and supply remains pretty muted relative to other markets. And if you look at a place like Orange County, job growth has really made the difference there, where it's up closer to 2% over the last six months. And so while there's still a meaningful amount of supply coming on in certain submarkets there, Huntington Beach, Anaheim, et cetera, Irvine, the job growth has really caught up to a point where it's pretty healthy. So the momentum in Northern California is strong, Southern California is strong.","Now in the East Coast markets, the Mid-Atlantic, certainly helpful to see a pickup and I mentioned that essentially rent change was flat in the first quarter. It's positive about 100 basis points for the second quarter. And I think it's just going to be touch-and-go in the Mid-Atlantic over the course of the next year depending on how job growth comes out. But assuming we maintain or accelerate on the job front in the Mid-Atlantic markets, we know what the supply is going to be, we'd likely to see pricing power consistent with what we're experiencing now to potentially slightly better as we move through the year, particularly as the household formations start to come through as consistent with what's forecasted for 2015.","So really as you talk through the markets, it depends on where you're located, what your exposure is within certain submarkets to supply, et cetera. But in general, pricing power is continuing to improve at different rates across the footprint.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Dan. Tim here. Just to add a little bit to part of your question, I think. Generally, the West Coast is, if you look historically, has just been more volatile and the East Coast has been more stable. So as the East Coast has tended to outperform kind of later in the cycle, it's been less about it accelerating past the West Coast and more about it being a stabilizer relative to more volatile performance on the West Coast.","I think it's a little bit of open question how things may play out this cycle. As you saw on the one chart, if household formation really does recover to the 1.5 million plus range and housing production levels really just don't respond in a material way quickly, we're already seeing rental vacancy rates at 30-year lows, you're seeing ownership vacancy rates approaching kind of longer-term norms. You get another couple of quarters of the kind of household formation we think we've seen, I think there could be a shortage and an acceleration and impacts potentially all markets from a pricing perspective, whether that's for sale or on the rental side.","Dan M. Oppenheim - Zelman & Associates","Great. And, I guess, looking at the chart where you're showing the new versus move-in, I guess, on page five, showing the improvement in the new movement on the rental rate is certainly positive there. Just thinking about the renewals, especially on the West Coast where the overall growth has been the strongest, how much are you pushing the renewals? Is there any caution about pushing too much and driving turnover higher there?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, this is Sean. I mean, certainly a conversation we have all the time in terms of optimizing the performance of the portfolio. But at this point, we feel pretty comfortable that we're handling it in a way that's not only optimizing the performance, but also is based on what we think the customer's reaction will likely be, given available choices within their specific submarket and general geography.","And one thing to keep in mind is people focus a lot on the renewal numbers versus the move-in rent change. You really have to look at it on a blended basis because it really depends on \u2013 if you talk about same-unit rent change when the last person moved in, if they moved in five years ago, it's very different potential rent they're coming out of five years later as compared to someone who has been there two years. So if you look at it on a blended basis, it's probably more appropriate.","And the other thing that we look at is how wide is the gap getting between the absolute rent that a customer is paying as they move into an apartment relative to someone who is renewing in that same apartment type or the same community. And that spread today on an absolute basis is only about 2%. So when you think about it, it's not that wide in terms of an existing customer going to a website and looking at pricing for their particular apartment home for someone who is moving in. And, obviously, they have switching costs in terms of their move and everything else. So that's a relatively reasonable spread 2%. We'd probably be a little more concerned as that number was approaching 5%, as an example, but across the portfolio, I think we're in a pretty good shape on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico, of UBS.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Tim, I was hoping to just start off with the guidance again. I mean, you guys are at the high-end year-to-date on same-store revenue, above on same-store NOI, you talked about really good trends so far and even in April. So how do we balance that against you guys not deciding to raise guidance? Is there something in the back half of the year that you're concerned about or you just want to take a wait-and-see approach for another quarter?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Nick, I mean, first of all, the first quarter more or less played out the way that we expected, particularly as it relates to the top line. So, that alone wouldn't sort of drive a need to rethink our outlook at this point. We are moving into the peak leasing season. While we're well-positioned and we're off to a strong start, we're going to have a lot more visibility mid-year, and that's typically when we do a more robust re-forecast process and sort of reopen the property budgets, if you will, and feel like we'd be in a much better position to give the investor and analyst community a sense of where we think we're going to end up for the year. So we're neither changing or affirming outlook at this point, but we would look to do so mid-year.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the development pipeline, two questions. One is, should we assume the forward gets settled all in the third quarter, and then how are you thinking about funding the next wave of development? I think you guys were saying you would do $1.4 billion in starts this year, would you consider another forward? How are you thinking about that over the next couple of quarters from a funding standpoint? Thanks.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Nick, this is Kevin. I guess, there's a few questions in there. First, as it relates to when we draw capital down under the equity forward. As I think we indicated in the fourth quarter call, our expectation is that we do so in the second and the third quarters. Really no new news on that front. It's somewhat dependent upon what we do in terms of incremental capital activity going forward over the next couple of quarters otherwise in terms of disposition activity and raising debt capital pursuant to our capital plan that could affect the timing there. I think it's probably fair to assume that probably at least two-thirds of it would be in the third quarter and a third or less would be in the second quarter, but that number bounces around quite a bit. And there what we're looking at is just trying to balance cash on hand and minimizing our costs \u2013 interest expense costs under our line of credit with our other activity on the capital markets front.","The second question, just to sort of answer that, it might be helpful just to give a refresh on our capital plan for the year. If you look back at our initial outlook, we had total sources and uses of $2.35 billion. And in terms of the sources, we had cash on hand and an expected drawdown on unrestricted cash account for about $600 million of that. As you'd probably noticed, we drew down cash by $300 million during the quarter to fund Columbus Circle, so that has happened as planned. That left us with about $1.75 billion of external capital in our capital plan for the year. About $650 million of that relates to the forward, which we just talked about, leaving $1.1 billion. We sold one asset, Stamford Harbor, in the first quarter. That leaves about $1 billion of net incremental capital, which we expect to source predominantly in the form of unsecured debt, and the balance in the sale of assets. So those are thoughts regarding sort of the capital plan for the year.","I guess, the final question is what is our philosophy around the use of the forward. I know we used it for the first time at the end of last year. The reality is we've been aware of the forward for probably more than five years as a tool that was in our tool kit, if you will, that we could potentially use to fund development. And as we talked about in the past, you need to sort of have the right confluence of factors that would justify when to use it again. And certainly, first and foremost is the expectation of elevated funding needs for development.","We certainly have that this year, or have that this year. We saw that by the middle of last year being something we wanted to think about. As we disclosed in our initial outlook, we expect to spend $1.7 million on development and re-development activity. That's a cyclical high for us so far this cycle and a meaningful amount of capital. And that really informed our view about wanting to be more like 100% match funded rather than being more like, call it, 75% match funded, which is where we've really been for the most part throughout this cycle.","So it's a tool in our toolkit. It's something we can potentially use, but it's not something we necessarily feel like we need to use all the time, but really it needs to be driven more by an unusual confluence of factors with elevated funding needs being probably the most important.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, it's Haendel. Good morning. So a couple questions here on development. So first, you guys started a couple of projects, two that I'd characterize as ex-urban or well outside of the core of the MSAs, your Hunt, Chase (41:06) and Lynnwood projects. And you're not seemingly slowing down on your development pace as much in a time period where your peers are slowing more so. But specifically these two projects, what is it about these projects that makes you excited, especially in light of the Suburban Maryland weakness comment? Are you gearing yourselves to capitalize on a perceived pent-up demand in the suburbs? And if so, how much more of your near-term development start could be more suburban in nature versus urban?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Hey, Haendel, this is Matt. I can speak to that one. It was actually a light quarter for us for starts, $100 million, and we're on track to start $1 billion, $3 billion, $3.5 billion for the year, and that is obviously a very small portion of our kind of development activity planned for the year.","The Alderwood deal was just a second phase of the deal that actually completed this quarter, and that deal completed at a yield of around 7%, so \u2013 and again, Seattle market, even there Suburban Seattle, that's probably a mid 4%s cap. So that's incredibly compelling value creation, second phase incremental economics. We just phased that deal, phased the land take-down, which was great.","The other one that we started this quarter, Hunt Valley, that's a bit of a unique asset for us. It is a suburban location, but it's a transit-oriented suburban location. It's actually at the end of the rail line; it's right next to a Wegmans, it's an old mall that has been turned into a town center and it's a submarket that has seen no new supply for probably 30 years. So in some ways, it's a lot like our kind of older Northeastern stuff where we're bringing a luxury product to a submarket that has very high homeownership cost and very high-end homes, estates and such up in that area as well as a decent amount of employment, a lot of other amenities, but just hasn't seen luxury rentals. So we think we're actually creating a bit of a market there and we don't get that opportunity very often. It also increases our exposure a little bit to the Baltimore Metropolitan area, which has done quite well this cycle, and where we're probably a little bit under-allocated in the long-term.","But more broadly, as we look out over our starts for the year, and we have said over the last year or so that we are starting to see our suburban assets perform a little better than our urban assets, and I think you're seeing that in general just because the supply is so concentrated in the urban areas, and also the urban product tends to be more compelling economically if it can be done earlier in the cycle because it's generally obviously higher capital costs when you get into concrete frame.","So when you look at our pipeline going forward, what's currently under construction is about 50% urban versus what's in the pipeline is probably about 25% urban. So it is more suburban than what we currently have underway. But we actually have some near-term starts; we have a near-term start actually in the District of Columbia that we expect to start here in the next quarter. So there's still a decent mix of product. And again, we're generally just driven by looking for where the best total risk-adjusted returns are in the market and, at this point in the cycle, that's where we're finding it.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I appreciate that. Another development type of question. Looks like we're seeing some moderation in certain key input cost, land price costs are going up, but moderating; lumber and gypsum costs coming down, wage growth is moderating as well. Wonder what you're seeing on that front and how you might be factoring that into \u2013 all these lower costs into your prospective project underwriting in new starts?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","We would love to see some of that come through. The subcontractors have been holding on to it so far. Generally speaking, when we underwrite our business, we underwrite everything on a current spot basis. So we don't trend rents, we don't trend expenses and we don't trend capital costs. When we sign up a new deal, we say, if we were building this project today, here's what it would cost us to build it and here is the NOI we would expect to get out of that. And generally speaking, depending where you are in the cycle, we may be looking for a higher or lower spread between where that yield is and where cap rates are; if we're in a market, whereas, earlier in the cycle where we think there's better rent growth ahead relative to cost growth, we might be willing to go in at least to the initial due diligence with a tighter margin than if it was the other way around.","But generally speaking, we're still seeing costs grow at a pretty rapid clip in most of our markets. And again, it's driven mostly by subcontractor, by labor availability, which is getting tighter, and by subcontractor margins and just the volume of business out there. There is a lot of construction out there, the subs are busy, so they can afford to be pretty aggressive in the pricing they offer. And other than in Metro DC, where they're probably coming off of more production ramping into less production, and so they are a little hungrier. Other than in DC, pretty much all of our other markets, it's going the other way still.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And the last one on Edgewater. Now you've had a chance to go through the insurance assessment and recovery process. The $793,000 net loss figure you quote in the press release, is that the final figure? Could there be additional costs? And any updated thoughts on your plan to that project going forward? Could you \u2013 if you could term it if you're going to rebuild, sell et cetera?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Haendel, this is Kevin. I'll answer, I guess, the first part with respect to some of the costs. The $800,000 of costs that you see flowing through with respect to Edgewater were essentially our initial response costs with tenant displacements, fire wash, et cetera. We'll see what rolls forward. There probably are some modest costs, but nothing very significant in that regard going forward since we're clearing the site and the other building has been reoccupied. So not much in the way of Edgewater related costs that we expect.","In the quarter, what we did in the first quarter is we wrote off the net book value of the building that was the story, which was $22 million. It turned out the net third-party insurance proceeds that had been received during the quarter was $22 million, so that was an offset. So that really had no impact on our financials for the quarter. Going forward, we continue to work with the insurance companies on securing the balance of the insurance proceeds that we expect. And in our initial outlook, we indicated that the casualty loss was likely to be, with respect to the story building, greater than $50 million where we have 12% self-insured exposure of about $6 million.","So we're still working on that. It's a matter of just working through the documentation and obtaining final sign-off. And going forward, as we noted in our release, in the event that we receive additional insurance proceeds related to the casualty loss on Edgewater, those additional insurance proceeds will be reflected in the casualty gain, which would flow through in increased FFO, but will be pulled out for core FFO purposes.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Haendel, Tim here. Just in terms of your second question, really our focus in terms of the site itself has really been on clearing the site and cleaning the site to date, also just some salvage efforts that have been undergoing in terms of trying to recover some items from our residents, as Kevin mentioned, obviously the insurance process, which includes trying to help facilitate the settling of resident claims.","We have been evaluating options for the site as well as it relates to rebuilding. There's obviously a number of physical issues to be considered there in terms of the structural capacity of the garage that remains, but there's also political issues that we understand we need to work through with the town in terms of what might rightly be able to be rebuilt there in terms of the form and structure. And then lastly there is a lender on the site. It is subject to a credit pool that would need to be considered as part of this.","So I would say it's premature yet in terms of telling you what exactly our strategy is and timing around the resolution of the site, but something we're actively evaluating at the moment.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Tim, can you talk about how robust the condo development and condo conversion process is in your core markets today?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Rob, I don't know if they want to join in as well. I wouldn't say it's all that robust. You're certainly seeing some signs of it in New York and perhaps San Francisco. If you just looked at where apartment valuations are relative to condo valuations or for-sale valuations, it still really doesn't make sense in most cases to actually convert an asset to condominium and take that market risks and you're just not going to get enough compensation in order to do that. I think in some cases, and DC may be an example where it actually does make sense to think about new ground-up development, and certainly New York and San Francisco that makes some sense.","But we're just not seeing a lot of \u2013 frankly, a lot of unsolicited interest in our assets like we did in the mid 2000s to potentially convert \u2013 it's pretty isolated, I will tell you at this point. And it just makes sense when you go back and you track what apartment valuations have done over the last 10 years to 15 years versus what for-sale condominium values have done during that same timeframe. I think it's really going to be isolated at least over the next couple of years to really micro-locations and really kind of one-off type opportunities.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And then when you look at your redevelopment pipeline today, what's the expected returns on that and how many more projects do you expect to add to the pipeline this year?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Rob, this is Sean. In terms of redevelopment, the pipeline's pretty plentiful, particularly given what we acquired from Archstone. And I think what we've indicated in the past is that we'll probably start somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million to $150 million a year, roughly, in terms of redevelopment activity. Some from the Avalon legacy assets, but also a relatively high percentage of the Archstone assets, would be in that pool.","In terms of the returns, the returns so far this cycle have been actually very healthy. And the way that we look at it is, if you take the overall investment into the enhancements at the assets, we typically look at our returns that are probably underwritten in the 10% to 12% range, but actual results have been more in the mid-teens, and that excludes components that if you just have to replace the roof as part of a redevelopment or something where you're not really getting an economic return, it's more like CapEx. But in terms of the actual redevelopment opportunity, kitchens and baths and other enhancements in common areas underwritten again 10% to 12% and producing mid-teens recently.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And then last question. The 35 projects on the developments right page, I mean how many of those are shovel-ready today, and is there any sort of issue or reason why you guys only started two this quarter? In terms of your thinking, is that that's what was available and that's where the yields were. Is there a situation where the starts are, on some of the stuff that you're planning for the rest of the year, sort of back-end weighted towards more urban, complex deals et cetera? Can you talk a little bit about that?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Sure, Rob, this is Matt. Pretty much when they're shovel-ready, we generally tend to start them. So we're planning a fair number of starts this next quarter here in the second quarter. And it just tends to work out that way; it's as much to do with weather as anything else you wind up with. Generally speaking, the deals in the pipeline, we're bidding them, we're finalizing the plans and permits. When we get the final bid numbers and we find the economics satisfactory, we tend to start them. So I wouldn't read anything into that except this next quarter we should have a pretty healthy amount of starts, and there isn't really anything in there that's ready to go that we're just sitting on.","Robert Chapman Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. I had a couple questions on your asset sale of Stamford Harbor. You provided the unlevered IRR of 11.9%. But can you also provide the leverage return given it's going to have mortgage debt? And also maybe share some of the characteristics of the buyer?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. This is Matt. We generally haven't provided those numbers. The deal was originally developed off the balance sheet; it was put into a pool. When? 2009 or...?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","So it's hard to kind of isolate that. And the buyer, I think it was a private buyer, folks that we've done other business with before.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Regional player.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah, regional player.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Where do you think your dispositions will come in this year versus your average run rate of $380 million?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Well, I think we've provided some guidance at the beginning of the year with our outlook in terms of the total disposition volume.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. John, this is Kevin. As I mentioned in my early remarks, I went through sort of the capital plan that we announced at the beginning of the year, and much of that capital, at least externally, is yet to be formed apart from the equity forward and sale of Stamford Harbor. That leaves about a $1 billion of net incremental capital pursuing to our initial plan for the year.","We don't break it out further than that other than to say that the predominant amount of that capital, we expect, will come in the form of unsecured debt and the balance would be in the sale of assets, partly because we don't really want to be overly precise with respect to our anticipated debt capital markets activity by giving specific amounts and, plus, because the capital market conditions can change and the precise amount may change throughout the course of the year. But it'll be mostly in the form of unsecured debt, at least that's our plan and hope, and the balance would be sale of assets.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Just a follow-up question on Edgewater. According to your disclosure, the lender of the mortgage debt can decide how you use the insurance proceeds, whether or not to repay the loan or redevelop the asset. So if the lender chooses to redevelop, do you have a choice and can you potentially change the scope of the project?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, John, this is Kevin again. As Tim noted, we're still in discussions with respect to \u2013 with the lender and also evaluating what our plans are for the asset. So it's a little bit early to say what's going to happen with respect to whether we're going to redevelop \u2013 whether we're going to rebuild Edgewater and what's going to happen with our discussions with the lender.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then just one final bigger term question. But California continues to be very strong. At what point do you become concerned of the state's ongoing drought and maybe the potential impact on the economy?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure. John, Tim here, I'm not sure how to answer that really just in terms of the drought's potential impact on the economy. It's obviously affecting our properties in terms of we're subject to the same constraints that other homeowners are. And Sean, you might want to just talk about a little bit about that.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I mean...","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But as it relates to its economic impact, it'd be total wild speculation on our part.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, John. This is Sean. I mean there has been plenty of press out there about the state mandated reductions in water usage and higher rates as a result of exceeding the 25% targeted reductions for the state. So I think people are getting their arms around that in terms of how that actually flows through to communities and to residents who ultimately pay the majority of the water bill. But I think the general expectation is certainly that there will be potentially higher utilities cost across the board in that market, which would impact just choices in terms of residential dwellings, whether it's multi-family, single-family, whatever your choices are.","And in terms of our response, our response is, as you might imagine, trying to be as efficient as we can. And before this even came out, we have already started initiatives related to smart irrigation systems and things like that to try and be as efficient as possible as it relates to water usage, because there had already been pressure on rates, water rates, in California as a result of the drought.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","There have been some market reports that developments are slowing down. Are you seeing this at all?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Developments are slowing down as a result of the water issue?","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","I've not heard that.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question. In terms of New England, you outlined the sort of snow removal cost impact on expenses. Just curious what impact you saw on the leasing side? I mean it seems like things did track a little bit higher than last quarter on a year-over-year basis, but just curious how much of an impact you saw on leasing and if there's been a notable improvement since things have started to fill out here?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Vincent, this is Sean. Yes, we did quantify the OpEx impact in New England. And if you had excluded the impacts of those storms on OpEx, our year-over-year growth rate in OpEx was about 100 basis points less.","In terms of the impact on the revenue side, it's a little bit difficult to quantify. I mean you could look at traffic and net leases and things of that sort to try to quantify it as best as you can. We had a difficult winter there last year; it's worse this year. So you know there's some impact, but it's really hard to quantify what that is in terms of who didn't show up.","New England is a market sort of like Seattle that's a little more seasonal than the average market, specifically is relatively soft or quiet in the first quarter in terms of what you might you see in market rent growth and then it ramps up materially as you get into March and April through about July, and that's pretty much the pattern we've seen this year. So it's not terribly different from what we've seen in the past. We structure our lease expirations in New England in the first quarter to be pretty low, lower than the average across the portfolio for the first quarter, and that diminishes the level of activity in the region to begin with.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then just another question, last quarter, I think there was a question about the remaining Houston assets and they're getting ready to be marketed. I was just curious if you had any color on what you're seeing in terms of demand for those assets and pricing and that kind of thing?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah, Vincent, this is Matt. We have two assets in Houston. One of them we did market in the last several months; it is under contract now, so I can't really comment any further than that. I can let you know more when it closes. And we have one other asset there that we are positioning for sale, but we have not brought to the market yet.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I mean, I know it's under contract, but I mean any comment on the demand you saw for that asset, was it better than expected, in line?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","I really can't get into that when it's a pending transaction.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. And thank you for all of your thoughts earlier on your portfolio allocation goals and accomplishments. It's been a very busy period, but I want to revisit one goal or idea that you had suggested back at your Investor Day in 2010. At the time you said that your portfolio was 15% Class B but the efficient frontier analysis indicates that 25% would be optimal. Where do you stand as it relates to that?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Dave. This is Tim. I think as we talked about maybe in the last few calls, we think about really more from a brand allocation standpoint at this point, but you can think just sort of roughly eaves as a Class B generally suburban and Avalon largely is Class A, and AVA can be bit of a mix, but probably more Class A than it is Class B. And what we said is it's less about a target allocation for the entire portfolio than trying to optimize positioning of assets within target submarkets. And that sometimes is going to be a more affordable asset; in other cases, it's going to be more of Class A or newer build type asset.","And we were just trying \u2013 back in November 2010, we were trying to give an indication what we thought the outcome of that strategy might look like. But as we've mentioned in the last few calls, we're active developers right now and we're allocating more capital through new development than we are through acquisition. And so, you might expect that weighting to continue to be a little bit more weighted towards Avalon then eaves over the next couple of years as we build out the portfolio.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Right. That makes sense. I know you've published this many times but I don't see it in front of me. What's eaves as a percentage of the portfolio?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Eaves today is about 17%, AVA is about 6% and the remaining 75%, 76% is Avalon today, and that's by sort of fair market value of the assets, if you will. So, on a unit count, it would be a little different than that.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And the other question relates to the American Bible Society deal, seems really interesting. We're hoping you could provide a little more detail on that including your expectations for Street retail rents in that sub-market.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Hey, Dave. This is Matt. We are actively working that project; obviously we closed at the end of January. We've put the design team together, are working through the concept designs right now, moving it as quickly as we can towards hopefully a start sometime the second half of next year. And as part of that process, we are talking to potential retail partners, and it is quite possible that we'll wind up doing a transaction there to bring in somebody either on a forward sale basis or on a current basis to take the retail.","We do have some estimations of what we think retail rents are there, but ultimately we know that that is a material part of value of that asset, and that is not our area of expertise obviously as much as the residential. So, we may well bring in a partner there. It's about 55,000 feet of retail divided between three levels: the ground floor, the second floor and some cellar space, and obviously the rents are very different, depending which of those floors you're on, and even if you're on the Broadway frontage versus the 61st Street frontage. But we're looking at in terms of what the total value of the retailers and therefore what the total value of our net investment will be after that, assuming that somebody else ultimately owns that.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Okay. So, lot move in pieces, nothing else that you can share right now?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Right.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Ann Weisman of Credit Suisse.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. This is Chris (01:05:33) for Ann. In your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about how you strategically increased your exposure to the West Coast over the last 7 years to 10 years. But when you look at your $3.3 billion shadow pipeline, the vast majority of that comes from your East Coast markets. So, can you talk a little bit about what you're going to do in terms of develop those assets or those land parcels or are you going to be going out to buying more land in order to increase your exposure to the West?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. That's a fair question. This is Matt. I can get into that a little bit. Obviously you're right. Our development rights pipeline is more heavily weighted to the East. I think that's a function of a couple of things. One is the entitlement cycles tend to be very extended particularly in the Northeast, so some of those deals are in there for a long period of time, three years, four years, five years. So that isn't necessarily reflective of the balance of the way the starts will be. The West Coast deals have tended to come in and move out more quickly, particularly early in the cycle where we were buying sites that maybe someone else had entitled. So, some of it is just timing mix, some of it is market timing though that the West Coast markets are more volatile, as Tim had mentioned, and so, we were trying to be very aggressive about getting in early in the West Coast markets, where the development window can be a little narrower. So I think we are more careful about that.","But having said that, we are looking at some pretty significant West Coast land opportunities right now and we're continuing to pursue those. So I think you may see that mix change a little bit over the next couple of quarters. But generally speaking, the deals in the West do seem to come in and out of the pipeline a little bit more quickly.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And, Chris, just one last thing to add. As we feel like we're getting out of balance between the East and West, you can obviously manage that through just buying and selling assets as well. So...","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","While opportunity may not allow us to do that through development based upon where you're in the development cycle in particular markets, we do have a little bit more flexibility as it relates to buying and selling assets.","Unknown Speaker","Great. That's really helpful. I appreciate it. Just now a couple of questions about like impairments and how those hit the income statement. It looks like you have about roughly $5.8 million impairment hitting the income statement where $4.2 million is coming from Northeast weather and then about $800,000 from the loss on Edgewater. What's the remaining $800,000?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Chris, this is Kevin. The remaining $800,000 is an impairment charge on land that is about to go under contract for sale that we expect to close in the second quarter.","Unknown Speaker","Got you. And then in terms of the Northeast storm impairment, it's reversed above NAREIT FFO. Is there any reason why that's the case?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","It's a casualty on depreciable real estate, which under the NAREIT definition of FFO is added back to FFO.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. That's helpful. And then, last, of the $3.2 million you have added back to core FFO, I assume the $793,000 is for the actual impairment and is the balance kind of the opportunity cost of lost trends. And of the, I think $0.09 to $0.11 you have in the guidance for the full year, is that also a mix of opportunity cost and actual cost?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","On the first part, the $3.2 million that is added back in our Attachment 13 of the release is added back to Core FFO from FFO. It consisted about $1.6 million in lost NOI from Edgewater. So, we expect roughly speaking that \u2013 that to recur throughout the balance of the year. $800,000, as you point out, is tied to Edgewater's, the incident response costs that we incurred during the first quarter and the remaining $800,000 is the land impairment costs for the wholly owned parcel that we just mentioned a moment ago. Can you repeat the second question again?","Unknown Speaker","No. I think you pretty much got it, but it sounds like that's going to be recurring throughout the year and that the $0.09 to $0.11 will be a mix of those two things?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think it's probably \u2013 we can follow-up afterwards, but basically just to be clear in terms of what I just was describing. Of the $3.2 million, $1.6 million relates to lost NOI from Edgewater and that will recur throughout the back half of the year.","Unknown Speaker","Right, right, yeah.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","So you just multiply that by three and that's what we expect to receive over the next three quarters. The other two items, the $800,000 in response costs from Edgewater and $800,000 in land impairment costs, those are one-time items that we experienced in the quarter and do not expect to recur over the balance of the year.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. That makes sense. Thanks a lot, guys.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Okay.","Operator","We'll go next to Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hi. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions. Just two that are really quick. First, Kevin, you talked about potential debt issuance. Going back a few months ago, the rating agencies seemed to be indicating they may be looking to upgrade you guys. Although based on the conversations, it's like the debt markets already priced you guys like an A type credit. So, as you are thinking about debt issuance or capital for the rest of the year, are you obligated to change any of your thoughts or this is all the rating agency is doing, you guys aren't asking for any of this, and therefore you're not changing the way you view your capital structure or development spending, et cetera?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Alex, this is Kevin. Our thoughts around our capital structure hasn't changed. The rating agencies have taken their own action of their own accord based on whatever they're seeing in terms of both the evolution of our business and the current capital market condition. So that's sort of the set of actions that are happening independently of us.","In terms of our capital plan for the year, our decisions around how much to raise is a function of how much we expect to expend on development and other activities. So it's driven by our uses. And so, as I mentioned earlier, we expect about another $1 billion of incremental activity on the sourcing front in the form of dispositions and unsecured debt issuance really because of the investment activity we have in our capital plan.","In terms of our choices around what to raise, it's really a function not of the rating agencies but rather what are the most cost-effective sources of capital at any given point in time. And as things stand today, unsecured debt pricing is relatively attractive.","Moreover, as you can see in our initial outlook from the fourth quarter, we have $650 million of debt that we expect to refinance, so that's a use. And on a leverage neutral basis with NOI on stabilized portfolio growing and development NOI coming online, we can add more than that amount in the form of newly issued unsecured debt and still grow on a leverage neutral basis. So that's how we're trying it around our total incremental need and how much of it might be in the form of unsecured debt. But at this point, as you know, we haven't issued anything in terms of debt, so we'll just have to wait and see what happens as we progress through the year.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And Kevin, can you remind us what cap rate they used for your unsecured debt \u2013 for the unencumbered pool \u2013 sorry, what cap rate they use?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","I'm not sure if I'm following your question. We have disclosure in our press release that talks about the cap rate that pertains to our line and I think that's a 6% cap rate, if I'm recalling it correctly, but you can just look through the attachment for that. But in terms of the cap rate that the rating agencies use, I don't have that information. I don't know that it will be something I'd want to share, if I did.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay, that's cool. And then separate question, are you now done with any of the legacy Archstone dispositions or gains or is there still potential for more to come?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I guess, one point I'll mention. This is Kevin again, Alex, and others may want to comment. We expect potentially in the second quarter \u2013 and you probably saw this in the JV income line item \u2013 to receive some additional settlement proceeds related to some pre-acquisition activity that will likely flow through in the second quarter and be included within reported FFO, but it's carved out for core FFO.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","But, I mean, in addition to what you've already disclosed, is there anything future beyond this or versus second quarter basically clears the deck and that's it?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Alex, this is Matt. There is one more asset. There were two parcels of land that went up in the parking lot, one settled earlier this year, there is one other parcel of land out there that it will eventually settle \u2013 may settle this year, it may not settle for a while longer, we'll see how the market plays out on that, but that's relatively minor one-time adjustment if it clears.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Well, it's been actually reflected in the first quarter.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Perfect. Listen, thank you.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Operator","We'll go next to Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Tayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Just along Alex's line of questioning, can you just talk a little bit more about what you're expecting for the rest of the year in regards to acquisitions overall, and generally what kind of pricing you're seeing in most of your key markets \u2013 I'm sorry, dispositions, not acquisitions?","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","Tayo, this is Kevin. I think overall, as I mentioned, there's probably an incremental $1 billion of capital we expect to source pursuant to our plan for the year. Most of that we expect to source in the form of unsecured debt; the balance will be dispositions. In terms of the dispositions that we contemplate \u2013 I think Matt outlined a moment ago that two of them relates to Houston, one we completed in Stamford Harbor in the first quarter. So there is overall and you step back there's not an awful lot of disposition activity that's anticipated within our capital plan and probably those two sources represents the bulk of that.","Tayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Kevin P. O'Shea - Chief Financial Officer","And Matt, anything you want to add just in terms of just the transaction market generally with what we are seeing out there?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","The transaction market has been very hot. There is clearly more demand from buyers to buy high quality multifamily assets and there are assets on the market for sale generally speaking. Obviously, it varies a little bit market-to-market. So like Kevin said, it's our need to fairly model it. We are always looking to transact. On the margin, if we can shape the portfolio, so we make some additional asset if we are using those funds to buy an asset, it may be in a submarket we like better, but right now the market is very active, very liquid.","Tayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Just in the nature of time as this call is going on a little bit long. But just the late additions over the last couple of quarters seems to be a little bit more of an urban focus particularly with the New York asset there. Is there any shift as you think about starts maybe two years, three years down the road kind of moving more urban \u2013 moving more back into that urban core as opposed to the suburban? And then just given the starts in D.C., you guys were among the first to sell out to reduce your exposure to D.C., ahead of the kind of the downturn. Can you just talk about your outlook for D.C. over the next, call it, two years to three years? Has the worst already passed, and do you expect kind of 2016 and 2017, would you expect D.C. to perform more in line with the rest of the portfolio or do you think there is a recovery potential there?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah, Michael, this is Matt. I can speak a little bit to the first part of the question, and then maybe Sean or Tim might want to add some color as well on D.C. longer term. In terms of our development rights, obviously, that Columbus Circle deal is a very large deal, so that does move the needle in terms of when you start looking at the numbers and weighting it by urban, suburban and those things. But, as I mentioned earlier, generally speaking, we're still finding \u2013 just when you look at overall supply\/demands fundamentals and you look at where land is pricing, the cost of construction, we're finding better risk-adjusted returns, generally speaking, on new land deals in suburban markets.","And again, a lot of this is infill suburban transit-oriented in-suburban job centers. Some of it is for that bedroom suburbs, but most of it is that kind of in a ring suburbs, I'll call it. So I would not expect our development rights mix to change materially one way or the other, but it's really bottom-up. So we don't sit here and say to the local teams, go find us five deals in an urban market and now go find us five deals in a suburban market, it's find us the best deals in your market. And they respond to what they're seeing on the ground and sometimes those are more urban deals, sometimes they're more suburban deals. But, at this point in the cycle, they are still more suburban Columbus Circle notwithstanding.","As it relates to D.C., we are planning a couple of starts in Metro D.C. here over the next couple of quarters, some of those are legacy positions, one of them is a large deal in the District that we had inherited the land from Archstone. But as it relates to the development cycle, it's probably a better time than it has been in the couple of years, if you think that D.C. has had several years of basically flat rent growth underperformance relative to the rest of our footprint and if replacement costs haven't moved all that much, it's probably a better time to be thinking about that. In terms of where fundamentals are headed and where rent growth might be two or three years from now, I don't know that we're in a position to predict that other than we know there's still a fair amount of supply coming in the next year or two.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Mike, maybe just add on to that. To be clear, I think I said in my remarks, we do expect the performance gap start narrowing between D.C. and our other markets. But over the next two years, we do expect it still to underperform. When you just look at the supply that's still coming and while job growth has picked up recently in D.C., we do expect it still to be an underperformer relative to our average markets over the next several quarters. But the match point, as it relates to development, you're really focused on the second derivative as well as the kind of the first derivative and that's oftentimes where those good land opportunity is and if you can time it from a construction standpoint, when the labor market is still relatively soft, that those are oftentimes our best-performing assets long-term.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for the color, guys. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to William Kuo of Cowen & Company.","William Kuo - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the color in the presentation. The additional data points are in the development pipeline. Just looking at page 16 where the five communities under construction in lease-up, whether the current projected yield is 6.9% versus the 6.3% original, so about 10% higher. Given your view of the extended nature of the current cycle and, call it, two years to deliver the rest of the pipeline on average, is there any reason to think that the current pipeline \u2013 if I estimate about 6.2% yield that that won't stabilize at 10% higher as well?","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, William, it's Tim. I mean, if you look over the last three or four years, the deals that we completed have all stabilized on average for each vintage year, if you will, above what we had anticipated upon original projection. It's just really just rent growth. So I think it's going to come down to how you underwrite rent growth over the next four or five years. To the extent we continue to see a long sustained cycle where we're getting trend to above trend rent growth, we'd expect stabilized returns to be above what we first report in the release when it initially goes on the schedules.","William Kuo - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just quickly, I know that High Line, West Chelsea is 97% leased. Can you talk about the performance of the two different segments versus original expectations and how splitting up that into the two segments has performed?","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. William, this is Sean. In terms of the performance, we've been happy with both the AVA and the Avalon product. AVA delivered first a little bit bigger building and Avalon followed. But when you look at it just from a lease-up pace perspective and what happened with rents through the course of the different seasons, the lease-up performance relative to the original expectations was pretty similar between the two, both Avalon and AVA.","William Kuo - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Sean J. Breslin - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah.","Operator","We have no other questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to Tim Naughton for closing remarks.","Timothy J. Naughton - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Augusta. Well, thanks for being on today.

Naughton","Thanks, Jason, and I welcome to our Q3 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. I will provide management commentary on the slides that we posted this morning and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterward.","My comments will focus on providing a high-level summary of the quarter's results, discuss apartment cycle and fundamentals. Talk a little bit about portfolio trend and then lastly briefly touch on development performance and funding.","I\u2019m starting on Slide-4 which is an outline of highlights for the quarter. Our quarter FFO growth was just over 6% for the quarter and 9.5% a year-to-date. Our same store revenue growth was at 3.7% for Q3 and 3.9% when you include redevelopment that rate of growth is up 60 basis points from the second quarter. Sequential same-store revenue growth was at 1.9% versus 1.4% we experienced in the same quarter last year.","And we completed eight communities so this quarter totaling 465 million at an initial stabilize of 6.8%. And we started another three deals totaling about 450 million which brings our year-to-date starts right about $1.2 billion. And lastly, we raised about $230 million capital in an addition to that we have sourced another $685 million in the form of the equity forward.","Let\u2019s move to Slide-5 in that let\u2019s take a look at where we are in the apartment cycle versus the 90s cycle which we are think this cycle too. And we\u2019ll look at both the U.S. and our markets. For the broader AVA apartment market which is depicted by the three slides on the left there. Demand, supply and performance are attracting very closely in line with the 90s apartment cycle.","When you look at the job growth, apartment starts and rent growth they are almost identical through the first 19 quarters of this cycle as compared to the 1990s. Our market rents have grown cumulatively approximately 15% since the trough which is somewhere to the 90s when rents have grew by more than 50% by the end of the expansion.","Our core markets which are denoted with the three charts on the right that our current cycle has performed and it tracks the U.S. overall with rents growing about 15% at the center trough but the fundamentals underlying that performance have been very different than the 90s.","Our job growth has been much stronger this cycle with technology markets leading the way and stores have been in line with national averages which is different about this cycle and something we discussed in past calls, suppliers come earlier than normal in our market this cycle just given capital preference for gateway market and also the underlying economic growth in our markets which has been strong so for this cycle.","Moving onto Slide-6, another major difference this cycle than its driving strong apartment demand is demographics and consumer behavior which is driven in part by shifts lifestyle apparent. First demographics are much stronger this cycle shown on the chart number 1 in the upper left with a growth of the (inaudible).","And this demographic is behaving differently than past cycles. They are buying less with rates down 700 basis points from the peak this cycle and lower than what was experienced in the 1990s. Many haven\u2019t even yet formed the household, choosing it\u2019s best to have home at an increasing rate for longer periods. Perhaps or it\u2019s maybe extending out lessons and putting life on hold a bit marrying at an age of starting a family about three years later than the prior generation. So clearly demographics and lifestyle behavior and having profound impact that apartment demand this cycle.","Turning to Slide-7, we talk about supply for a moment, how worried should we all be about supply. No doubt apartment started to have significantly since the trough and are now above their 25 year average but they are in line with prior expansions, periods were underlying demands fundamentals want nearly as attractive as here today.","And starts to appear to be stabilizing based upon three months averages over the last year and shown in the second chart in the upper array. Our company level supplies further supported by broader housing market starts and only running at about a million per year which after (inaudible) is closer to 600-700 net starts per year. Significantly below most third party estimates of net household formation that\u2019s projected over the next several years.","Obviously supply could take another way out and that\u2019s what we\u2019re watching carefully, the recovery, the apartment breach this year in the equity market and the recent approval NMHC Equity Index show them a lower rate, signaled a capital is more confident about forming fundamentals which we understand could translate into higher production levels at some point in the future.","Now however for now, we believe the sector is fine and over the foreseeable future as recent starts turn into new deliveries, but it does bear keeping a close eye in over the next few quarters.","Shifting to Slide-8 let\u2019s take a look at our portfolio, recent trends and performance there. As I mentioned earlier same-store revenues accelerated in Q3 with the rate of growth up 60 basis points what we saw Q2 on a year-over-year basis that was driven by improvements at same unit rents which have accelerated since the beginning for about 2% year-over-year growth in January to 4.5% in September and you could see that on the left hand side of the page. In Q3 same unit rents were up by an average 4.3% which was 50 basis points higher than the same quarter last year, so increasing relative to what we experienced in 2013.","Moving onto Slide-9, we always improvement in rent growth on a year-over-year basis could be \u2013 in terms of the rate of rent growth can be attributed to stronger performance in the last. As growth by the East Coast is more or less has been added just for what we experienced in the third quarter last year. Northern California and Seattle continue to lead the way in the west but rent growth in Southern California was close to 6% in the third quarter which is the strongest we\u2019ve seen so far this cycle in that region.","Moving onto Slide-10, with supply raising particularly in urban markets we\u2019ve seen a shift performance by submarket and price point. And as we mentioned last suburban rent growth is now outpacing urban rent growth and try to waive back, it will continue over the next several quarters when urban deliveries will be more than double that of the suburbs. This is a pretty consistent trend across our markets.","In addition generally value OE product or B product or maybe or EUs in our portfolio is outperforming higher end luxury products. The trends in our portfolio skewed a bit by higher concentration of Eaves in the California markets. There are some markets where A product is still outperforming B, actually of the 20 markets that AXIA covers for us they actually report that A is well performing in 8 of the 20 markets or about 40%. Now well, B is outperforming in the other 12 are roughly 60% of our markets.","Moving on to Slide-11, shift to talk a little bit about development, our development portfolio continues to perform very well. The $450 million development that was completed this past quarter stabilized rents of 8% pro forma and yields that have raised by 70 basis points since the start of the construction.","Turning to slide 12, this transit continuing in our recent portfolio of the nine communities that are currently under construction and have significant release activity for 6% above pro forma or $130 and yields are up by about 40 basis points. So strong leasing and economic performance across the development portfolio.","Moving on to slide 13, importantly, the development portfolio, all the communities are under development and redevelopment of $3.3 billion bucket is fully funded with permanent capital already in place, include that dispositions that are under contract with deposits which totaled $200 million and the (inaudible) from our equity for transaction of almost $700 million. and lastly we continue to raise capital at an attractive cost as you can see in the slide 14 enabling us a lot meaningful accretion on both assets and basis year-to-date we have raised almost a billion capital excluding equity forward. Add initial cost that is approximately 300 basis points below the initial stabilized yield on the recently completed developments.","So for every billion of development, that stabilizes then of about 30 million of FFO accretion adding more than roughly 3% FFO for shared growth and about 400 billion in NAV accretion or about $3 to NAV per share.","So in summary, 2014 is shaped up to be another great year. The fundamental remains very strong and we have seen improvement in the last quarter -- from our stabilized portfolio. We have highly accretion development pipeline that is driving strong, external growth and which is fully capitalized along with the balance sheet that is positioned to provide plenty of flexibility to continue funding projected development starts in a highly cost effective manner.","And so, with that operator we are ready to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] And we will take our first question from Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Go ahead sir your line is open.","Nick Joseph \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks. How did you weigh the decision issue equity on a forward basis versus match funding using the ATM or using another form of capital?","Kevin P. O'Shea","Sure Nick. This is Kevin. In terms of the equity forward versus the CED or the ATM, the ATM activity that we undertook in the quarter of about $100 million was done in August and was done in reference to our capital and for 2014 potentially it was capital that we were looking to raise relative to our target for this year and in raising equity, we essentially substituted that for like amount of disposition that we otherwise would have done.","In terms of the equity forward, the thought process there as you might expect it with a little bit more complex fundamentally however, the purpose in raising that capital was to forward fund capital plan activity scheduled for 2015. So it's really related to next year not this year and so in doing so what we did, we took into account a few considerations. First, obviously as we have noted we faced elevated funding needs not only this year with $1.4 billion to start but also next year which we\u2019ve disclosed we expect the range between 1 billion and 1.5 billion in new development starts.","Second we will look at our principal funding markets which for us the transactions market common equity market on the debt market, clearly the common equity market historically has been our most valuable market to tap, access to \u2013 priced equity capital can sometimes be reduced for extended period of time often have little to do with market factors. Out of that something we took into account. And with our stock trading in early September about $156 a share we were trading in above any of these so pricing at that point time was relatively attractive, certainly relative to our development uses. I guess the final factor was just taking a look at the fact that capital efficiency for our overall funding program benefits and is enhanced by cooperating from time to time for common equity issuance when it is attracted to do so in order to avoid from having to pay meaningful special dividends or excise taxes related to capital gains which would otherwise generated from the funding strategy that\u2019s wholly relying on dispositions.","And so taking all those factors into consideration and looking at the facts of elevated needs this year and next year, common equity price was relatively attractive we thought it made sense to lock in attractive pricing and funding and create some NAV acquisition for investors.","Nick Joseph \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks. With the last investor presentation you put out last earnings you put a help slide I guess with the cost of account for heat map. I am wondering where equity screened at the time you issued the forward equity and where kind of debt assets sales and equity screen today?","Kevin P. O'Shea","I don't have date exactly when it was at that point in time but to give you a sense of assets sales on the heat map on a percentage basis have ranged around 78% to 80% over the last quarter or two. So pretty consistent and supporting the comment I made earlier about being the transaction market is relatively stable market for us for pricing perspective. Equity pricing can be fair a bit more volatile particularly when we look at how we are trading relative to consistent NAV and in terms of the overall equity temperature if you will on percentile basis which takes into account not only how we are trading relative to NAV but also some other factors including our yields and how we are trading relative to bonds in the broader market. Overall equity temperature was probably at that point in time in the high 60% range with our stock premium to NAV trade even higher than that more and more in the early 80% range. So that\u2019s probably where it was at that point in time. It's down a bit today from where it was then because obviously there are stock prices is a bit below it was then and I think our consistent NAV has risen a bit since then.","Nick Joseph \u2013 Citigroup","Right. Thanks and just quick on operations, can you talk about what you are seeing on the ground in southern California and what you expect going forward?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure, Nick this is Sean, as we noted in the management letter, we had expected Southern California to pick up speed and certainly played out that way in the third quarter. Generally speaking Orange County in LA have been the strongest of the three markets if you consider San Diego as well just to give you some data points, we talked a little bit about rent change in Southern California in the third quarter averaged in the mid 5% range as compared to low 4 last year. So overall good momentum and as you look at where we are headed in the October and then what\u2019s renewable look like in November and December in terms of rent change, those numbers are sort of in the mid 5% range for LA and Orange County and then in the high 4% range in San Diego and generally speaking things are solid across the three markets with some exceptions depending on the submarket that you are in and where supplied being delivered.","So just to talk through that for a second to give you some sense of it, in LA as an example, about 20% of the new supplies coming online in Downtown Los Angeles in 2014 and 2015. So, put a little more pressure in Downtown LA we have one asset and leap up there no existing asset and then also we are seeing some pressure in the Warner Center, Woodland Hills sub where there is still delivery underway at this point. A lot of the other sub that we are in are relatively protected and we feel pretty good about that. In Orange County display is really coming online from urban which is various parts of the ranch, little bit of sub county and in San Diego, listed supply is in places like (inaudible) as an example we don't have assets so it does depend on where you are located but generally speaking in Southern California overall.","Nick Joseph \u2013 Citigroup","Great. Thank for all the detail.","Sean J. Breslin","Sure.","Operator","Next we will go to David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Hey guys. Just a couple of questions around with the older pipeline if I might. I noticed that the overall yields on new projects are trending down modestly but you stabilized yields and your recent property are moving up. Is there too much conservative in the original estimates or are it's really just the function of the mix of assets that are in lease up at the moment that are outperforming because of specific market conditions?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","David hi this is Matt, I guess I will try to address that one. As it relates to the overall yield on the pipeline, I guess it's down 10 basis point from the last quarter and that really is a function of just the specific asset that move in and out of that bucket geographically. So we had large rise in Boston in this quarter and we had a few assets to complete it last quarter that are not longer in that number. They were I think the assets we completed last quarter were in the low seven. So it some of it just the math of that overall, I would say we are pretty conservative in our underwriting but we are consistent in our conservative and we always underwrite today's ranch, today's cost, today's operating expenses and that's the yield that we report until we start leasing the asset. So frequently that can be an average year and half, a year in some cases even two years between when we start the community and when we start leasing it so the extend rates have grown in that period, you will get some list of out the yields.","So I think we have been pretty consistent seeing that list when we open for lease relative when we started the job. Having said that, there is more supply out there than there was a couple of years ago. So it wouldn't be surprising if the amount of that list isn\u2019t quite as strong on deals with stabilized in the next year to the ones that are stabilized this year.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful and then my second question just has to do with energy cost. I know this is probably a bit premature but are you underwriting any I guess improvement in total construction costs on products that are being under at the moment? Are you anticipating labor cost, any of that being written to the yields that you are looking at today?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","This is Matt. In terms of the hard cost no, I mean I guess again what we are underwriting every time we update the pro forma which we will do throughout the process until we start construction is what we think would cost to build today. There are markets where we see construction cost pressures moderate particularly in the DC metro where they basically pretty close to flat at this point. The west coast is still moving up pretty strongly although maybe the edges off that a little bit but honestly the construction cost pressures have a lot more to do with labor cost and with some contractor margin just how much business they have got relative to how much business they can handle or they want to take on. It's much more responsive to that than it is to commodity pricing.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then, just ask one more the total dollar value of the right pipeline went down slightly to about $10.9 billion is that just the function of timing and lumpiness or is that an indicator of some contraction in the total size of the pipeline potentially?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","Probably a little bit of both. I mean this is a big year for start. We are starting a billion four this year, a billion three, billion four which would be kind of our peak. So I think we have set pretty consistently that this probably is kind of our peak for development underway. And we also had a lot of development rights that we acquired through the outstanding transaction last year that we moved into production this year. So there was a bit of one time lift there, so I would say now it's probably hopefully over the next couple of quarters we will see as much added to the pipeline as well, take out in terms of the new start but there is definitely \u2013 it's a bit of bottom process and fewer deals have been kind of hitting the target relative to year, two ago.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. It's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jana Galan with Bank of America. Go ahead ma'am.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Is it possible to provide like term when changes after Boston and your outlook there as you had a nice sequential pick up and then maybe offer similar stats for Washington DC?","","Sean J. Breslin","Sure Jana. This is Sean. I\u2019ll give you guideline on New England overall which includes Fairfield, Boston some of it be slightly higher end -- give you but in terms of blended rate change in the third quarter for New England overall average about 3% in the third quarter and what you are probably going to see is as you move \u2013 New England is a pretty seasonal market. You get a lot of lifter in the summer time from short term leasing activity, people come from different regions, water etc. and then it as you go into the fourth quarter it's more seasonal than sort of the average market that we have. So you will see that trail off as you head into the fourth quarter and then as it relates to the bit lag overall a blender rent change for the third quarter was positive about 50 basis points with no move in down about 2.5% and the renewals up about 3.5% and based on what\u2019s on the books today that's the pretty similar pattern for October.","November and December is yet to be total course, but renewals are going out in a range that would indicate that those numbers are sort of in that same mid 3% range maybe slightly higher on renewals as we get through November and December.","Jana Galan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin","Sure.","","Operator","And we will go next to Nicholas Yulico from UBS.","","Unidentified Analyst","Hey Tim its Ross with here for Nick. Can you talk a little bit about some of the mortgage finance, I guess proposals or chatters that's out there from the (inaudible) specifically in their efforts to expand credit to the mortgage single family housing world and some of their plans at least to looking at 95% to 97% loans to values. As you think about your capital plans going forward, how do you think about what you are hearing out as a Milwaukee space?","","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, maybe the one thing that does make sense from my perspective is to what is being discussed with FA as the maybe just some clear rules around loan put backs which I guess probably is good just for maybe helping unstuck some capital and home mortgage market but as it relates to GSEs potentially guaranteeing lower down payment loans I think as you mentioned as low as 3% we have been there before kind of that look like but I think there is a real question at least in the multifamily industry whether it's necessary and how long ship rates are back to 64%, 65% range over there for 30 years before the big run up in the 2000. So when you look at demographics and any impacts of higher leverage which is going to result in higher defaults question whether how much it hurts ultimately the capital markets and the housing markets we will see but you got to speak from our perspective, tax payer and maybe secondly to see of all things that could have been done I am not sure, list as it relates to stimulating the economy it does feel a little bit like real playbook without regard to anything as it relates to underlying fundamental changes in demographic.","So as it relates to how it might affect their business I think now we will see. In our sense that one of the reasons -- much home buy is it's not just about the payment, it is about, we saw in the slide show about people's lifestyles and choices they making around family and marriage which is ultimately what drives that purchases as much as the financial side of it. So we will see in terms of the impact ultimately to multifamily and see the department sector but we are not crazy about the changes to speak and putting my tax ahead on.","Unidentified Analyst","Is it your I guess maybe I paraphrase that the company is not including a size makeshift in the single-family versus multifamily or call it dynamics in the home ownership rate over the next couple of years that\u2019s a fair paraphrase?","Timothy J. Naughton","We are not certainly as it relates to multifamily versus single-family then I think the multifamily decision versus single-family really is a \u2013 is more of a demographic issue chances where he chose to purchase or not a condo that could be a fact of by what\u2019s happening for service related to our branch right now it\u2019s not impacting, it\u2019s not impacting the business by any delay, ultimately have an impact on apartment on condo values which you might see some conversion of existing stock or stock that was plan for to be built as a rental shift over the condominium to the extent more demand materializes as a result of the changing the rules.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, I just if hoping to talk a little bit more about knowing and then the areas they have put better numbers this quarter versus the second quarter you talked a little bit by knowing but and what else is going on in these markets that often there is a bit of pick up in fundamentals as these have been lagging markets?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, sure. This is Sean there and maybe a little my thoughts there, I mean New England, one thing that you keep in mind is the winter was so rough that it says that the borrow is relatively low in terms of being able to pick up steam as we went into the third quarter, so first quarter was pretty challenged which impacted the activity as we went into the second quarter because we won't be able to move the rent roll much throughout the first quarter and no office the rollout is in the February, March timeframe for April and May. So we really had an opportunity to sort of juice it a bit as we moved through the third quarter and then the other thing to keep in mind as the third quarter is typically sort of the peak for shorter term leasing activity in that market you will get little bit of boost just seasonally.","In most markets and as far lower pronounced then the market like New England and another market like Seattle as an example in the third quarter. So in terms of overall supply demand dynamics, I think it exchanged materially they only think that it\u2019s a, that\u2019s reported our improvement is that turnover was down pretty materially and Boston specifically on year-over-year basis so it\u2019s down about 900 basis points, the whole portfolio was down about 500.","So when you have in our pre-sizable reduction and turnover which mainly was attributed to people not buying homes as much in that market that certainly supports pricing power which is less inventory available to lease. So that\u2019s one sort of new answer to leases of England.","In terms of New York, New York is the function of lot of different submarkets that we are in and I\u2019d say we started to see a little bit of improvement in the midtown west submarket of Manhattan where we have two large assets that we acquired as part of the outstanding acquisition midtown west Clinton, we started to get traction on relatively one-third quarter they have been a little more in the week side with two or three lease -- they are competing against and couple of deals, we started to see those stabilize, there is none of assets (inaudible) that stabilized, so we\u2019re starting to see some of those larger assets stabilized but there is still a fair amount of supply in the New York and execution is from more supply who move into 2015. So I think New York is going to be a little bit choppy over the next 3 or 4 quarters as those deals lease up.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks.","Sean J. Breslin","Yes.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Derek Bower, ISI Group.","Derek Bower \u2013 ISI Group","Great. Thanks. How should we think about the development margins going forward especially as it related to the right pipeline you mentioned that 300 bits in the presentation but with that, would be reasonable to assume that narrows of retirement. So where is your expectation and where it trends?","Timothy J. Naughton","Derek, this is Tim, maybe start matter of this may want to jump in, I guess it\u2019s as you look at the margins they\u2019re obviously very, very healthy, it\u2019s not our expectation that that was going to continue just the way capital markets were great. So, with more supply coming in over the next couple of years, roughly, in our view roughly matching demand you will see start to moderate a little bit and then as we talked about last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve construction cost are starting to pace rate growth so two things are going to squeeze margins a bit. Hopefully we will start to help keep a lid on these start activities at the same time so that they can tend to be healthy just not as robust as we see and we always have the benefit of construction cost that are (inaudible) and you are delivering into a \u2013 and accelerating in the right environment and you get the kind of performance we have got where you get 70 \u2013 80 basis points which is dramatic.","You are talking about 10% to 15% improvement in the economics of the transaction for the time you start to time you finish. So we expect that level to moderate as Matt mentioned in his remarks, having said that, we in the 90s, we had a sustained period of time 7 \u2013 8 years where we are able to achieve good couple of hundred basis points above the cap rates in terms of profitability which given the cap rates are higher at the time probably translate into margins that were 10% less.","Matthew H. Birenbaum","Does matter. I just want to add to that which is one way we have responded to that a bit and you will continue to see it a bit of shift in terms of the product type and location characteristics of the deals that we start and that so if you look at our future pipeline starts the next year to only 10% of it roughly as higher and it's probably more suburban and focused where as the stuff it currently entered construction 40% higher rise and 50%+ urban. So and those deals tend to be lower yield. They are lower cap rate so the margin, but one of the way we have responded a bit has been we shifted our development focus on new rights to more of the new density product and suburban locations and we will start to see that come through in the next year to and I think that will help at least preserve the yield even if the margins get compressed a bit based on the cap rates.","Derek Bower \u2013 ISI Group","So you still see market rate growth outpaced construction cost in the suburban markets?","Matthew H. Birenbaum","I would say that margin rate growth has probably little stronger in the suburbs right now and the cost pressures have been a little bit lighter in that product type in some locations maybe not in southern California for the most part of the location. So it's probably keeping in pace there.","Derek Bower \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. Thanks. And then just wanted to clarify on page 13 of the presentation, should we still be thinking about that 700 million of forward equity for next year start, so I guess that implies still 400 left to be funded on the current pipeline.","Matthew H. Birenbaum","Well, I will speak to just the funding on the forward equity. We certainly under the forward contract have the right to issues shares any time now through September 8 to next year but as I mentioned at the \u2013 a moment ago, the reason for undertaking the forward transaction was to walking the funding associated with expenditure next year on funding. So while we might potentially issue here in the fourth quarter it's unlikely we will do so. It's likely we are going to issue at some point next year entirely over the course of the first week or the next year and so I don't know that's probably the answer to the question.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, just equity forward as Kevin said was to fund expenditures against existing commitments, I think we are -- do we have additional funding for existing commitments because that was year marked for our future commitments, future starts. Does that answer your question, right? ","Derek Bower \u2013 ISI Group","Yes it is. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take the next question from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. Go ahead sir your line is open.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Good afternoon. This relates to Derek\u2019s question it sounds like 2014 might not necessarily be the peak for development starts as originally planned and you talked about what factors are most likely to cause you to end up with a billion dollar of start versus the potential 1.5 billion next year.","Timothy J. Naughton","Hi Dave, Tim here. It\u2019s probably \u2013 its function of a several things obviously it's already. Often times we think there is going to be ready taking another quarter or two by the time you really -- 75% of the economics is deal as well. I mean some deals you have to rework at the economic start making sense you might have to value engineer and do some re-planning that can take a couple of quarters. So we try to give a range what we thought was representative of what it could be from a lot of high based upon those factors and capital obviously, always a factor but less of a factor just given our current capitalization and flexibility we have to release the assets markets given lot of our equity need to have already been met. ","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Right and going back to the 300 basis points spread that you have enjoyed year-to-date at what level does that alone cause you to pull back significantly on the starts?","","Timothy J. Naughton","I mean really starts further backing the process with the land commitment if you will and so I think you saw \u2013 you see in the press release that Matt was answering that question earlier about the development rights, we are drawing down development rights and not refurnishing as quickly as we are drawing down in part because of the opportunities that we are seeing in the market are little bit thinner than we have seen in the and not as many as kind of hitting the screen if you will or making it through the filter in terms of underlying economics. So it starts there. The pullback really starts there. If we are doing our job well it starts there so you don't feel yourself in the precarious position later in the cycle. But that doesn't mean that it's on automatic pilot that you are just going to start once you get permitted and approval. There \u2013 we still try to create incremental value on a risk adjusted basis and if we think the deal makes sense it's going to little bit deal dependent but a couple of hundred basis points of accretion or 150 basis points of NAV accretion in terms of yield over cap rate is certainly the ball park of what we consider the funding and moving forward with.","","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thank you for that and the next question is on turnover. Why do think turnover was down so much in the third quarter? Did it surprise you and what are your thoughts about permanently lower turnover in your sector given the secular factors such as later marriage, later home ownership going forward?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes Dave this is Sean. When you look at the reasons for the turnover in terms of what shifted, it's pretty consistent with last year. I mentioned how purchase are down little bit. Down about 110 basis points year-over-year just the total volume effective was down and so if you try to pause that and think about the precise reasons that goes up or down typically to labor mobility, option, things of that sort, I am not sure that there is one specific factor other than I would say last year we did talk about the fact that we are pushing rent relatively hard maybe a little bit harder than we should have at that point which create a little more in sort of all categories to be honest. We are still pushing pretty hard this year but not seen the same level of resistance I would say.","So to me what that translates to is just generally from an economic perspective people are feeling a little bit better about their situations and so whether it's a home purchase or rent increase or relocating somewhere, we are not just seeing the numbers move dramatically just the overall volume that's different. And then as it relates to the sort of broader question about lower turnover I mean you could I guess you get to that conclusion based on a number of the factors that Tim talked about is it relates to people delay in marriages and home purchases and things like that, I am not certain that we would be ready at this point in call that we think there is a permanent shift in that but to be thoughts on that as well.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes to be just clear, the point we are trying to make here is more of a generational issues we compare back to 90s we think sort of what the appropriate levels structure demand cycle versus the prior cycles. I think seeing that chart, it really has been gradual trend over the last generation but it is remarkably thinking just one generation that\u2019s increased by about \u2013 it's increased by about three years. Probably wish the turnover to go up a little bit on house hold based on the kids living there, they anticipated but I think it's probably more going on with the economy less labor mobility and that's probably \u2013 it's probably been the result of this particular cycle on year-over-year basis.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Okay thanks and last question is on DC, what are you looking for in that market to help you foresee a bottom rent growth?","Sean J. Breslin","Dave this is Sean. I will make a quick comment and then I have got Tim and Matt jump as well but I think Dave, essentially what we are looking for is more jobs. We know there is plenty of supply. There is more supply coming as you move in to 2015 pretty high levels here. We are talking about 4% or 5% supply coming on line and you are talking about jobs growth at for this year is projected to be less than 1%, that's not a formula for very positive outcomes so we have seen a pickup recently in this market but it's going to have to pick up much more significantly for adding -- to be in the positions to say that we have kind of bottomed down and we can start to see a line and then move up so when that's going to happen is function of a lot of different things but that's essentially what we need is more job growth out of this market.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley go ahead your line is open.","","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Good afternoon guys. So a couple of quick ones from me here. So first you have seen healthy trends over the last couple of quarters and we saw GAAP wide not a bit further to almost 200 basis points in for October. So my question is do you think you can maintain that 200 spread on new renewals through the weaker seasonal demand periods of 4Q, 1Q and also, can you give us some insight regional insight in some of your major regions on that new renewals that you have expect in October a spread of 200 basis points?","","Sean J. Breslin","Sure this is Sean. As it relates to maintaining the spread that is a little hard to protect. We feel pretty good about the numbers that went out in terms of the offers being at the 6% range for November and December which is up about 150 basis points relative to last year. We did that based on few different things; one momentum we had and where we had in the third quarter where we were up about 50 basis points year-over-year and then in October in terms of where we are trending. In portfolio just well positioned right now. So physical occupancy is around 96%, availability is around 5% when you look at the volumes of contract of lease expirations in the fourth quarter it's down about 20% relative to last year. So you are starting to triangulate into how I feel about those renewal offers based on recent portfolio trends and in general we feel pretty good. We have also made a few adjustments in our revenue management parameters that to the extent that we are pushing too hard. Its kicks in a sooner if you want to think about it that way. But in general we feel good about the numbers we have sent out.","As it relates to the individual regions, I will give you some numbers as it relates to what we did in the third quarter. I have an aggregate for the whole portfolios as it relates to the fourth quarter in terms of the offers that have been out that we are trending in October but just to give you some sense New England third quarter move in around 1% renewal in the mid fours, New York move in about 0.5 renewal just over 5 I mentioned Mid Atlantic earlier down about 2% on move-ins and up about mid 3 on renewals. And then as you move to the west coast obviously it jumps pretty dramatically as Tim mentioned earlier in the slide presentation. So specific North West move-ins around 6, renewal in the mid 8. Northern Cal move-in just over 9 it's actually a market where move-ins are actually ahead of renewals. Renewals are around 8 and in southern California base right on top of each other in the mid 5 and the renewals in the mid 5 as well.","","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Okay. I appreciate that. Couple of clarifications now, first one can you I guess the clarification on the mechanics of your ford equity contract. If you stop below $151.74 per share contract price of the equity forward by the time you settle the contract or before what September 2015, are you responsible to make up that difference or is the risk entirely to underwriters?","Timothy J. Naughton","We are not responsible to make up the risk. It's a fixed share forward equity contracts and so we walked in a $151.74 as the initial forward price. Going forward can only be reduced fairly two things; one is the dividend that we pay between now and then and a minor adjustment for daily interest factor. So we are not exposed to changes in future common equity pricing in terms of funding proceeds under that offering.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","I appreciate that and one more question I have just color or commentary on the land transaction market, I was just wondering given your activity, what are seeing out there the pricing environment for well-located land that meet your criteria or sellers pulling back a bit on pricing given some of that moderating growth sort of a forward outlook that you talked about earlier on your call.","Matthew Birenbaum","This is Mat, I guess I will take a short of that one and \u2013 it varies by market. So the most extreme example would be New York City and Manhattan right now where land prices are so high that rental economics really don't work, almost all the land of trading in Manhattan, any of the other land that is trading in Brooklyn now trading at condo evaluations. You starting to see that a little bit in San Francisco as well where the land values have gotten to a level that is pretty hard to make rental economics work.","In the market, I would say it's not quite that frenzy, Boston is probably flattish compared to may be what it was a year or two ago. There\u2019s definitely been more activity in the suburbs and some of our (inaudible) starting to look more aggressively in the suburbs as we have been for last year or two I would say. So maybe shifting a little bit from the urban to suburban area in Boston.","DC it probably is off a little bit and in terms more favorable deal that you have had to close right away before now, it will give you little more time, obviously there is little bit lesser buyers from DC but not as many fewer buyers that you might think.","Southern California, Seattle that's probably pretty steady land value is increasing, probably as fast as rents, it\u2019s not faster.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","Thanks, good morning, good afternoon, excuse me. Tim, at the start of the call, you said to keep eye an eye on starts activity could have another leg up. Can you say how and where Avalonbay would be prepared to react in a situation like that and sort of order of priority, what would you do? I know you mentioned more of low-rise development, more suburban development, what else might Avalon do to react to rising a pace of supply growth in your markets?","Timothy J. Naughton","Rich, couple of things, the point I was trying make, a lot of times it contained by capital, right amount while that you see in market and just given what\u2019s happened public market as well as the private market we are seeing equity has to be more confident about a product fundamentals, there are a couple of things and may be couple of things that are off about to supply. It has been since the late 80s remarkably stable, but I think a big part of that has been really the required\u2014number one equity requirements the two money equity requiring the sponsor to cover this which does limit the amount of anyone sponsor can do on our balance sheet right and that I think that has had a meaningful impact in terms of keeping it relatively stable. There was a lot of (inaudible) pretty much everybody there that you talked to, are expecting to do about the same that years they did this year and a year before, in terms of starts. So you are hearing a lot of people saying I am going to wrap way up or just cut it off. There are few people trying to get little concern about construction cost maybe not quite as same when on the market as they happen but overall just a picture of stabilizing, supply it feels like they expect the case from our prospective. As it relates to what we would do, in terms of potentially wrapping up. Again, it really comes back to, it happens in a more organic way, in terms of kind of a deal by deal basis. We can always increase our target return thresholds which would maybe choke off the amount of new deals we might see. Or we can lower them. In terms of what we call (inaudible). Lower you have to have a pretty different point of view about the trajectory of the economy and perhaps may be the view that thousand suppliers just talking (inaudible). So that\u2019s not we will have today, that's not a point of view but I think that why would you have to believe in order to think about wrapping it up.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","Okay, so sort of self-policing in a way but what about as a really kind of thinking also about just operationally, will you be trying to shift to a lesser aggressive rent growth policy and more protecting occupancy, I mean I assume that would be the case but how fast you think you could turn that around and do you think it will be necessary any time soon?","Sean J. Breslin","This is Sean. Let me mention a couple of things. One on average side but also on in terms of transactions, I just provide probably reasonable illustration here, the other thing I would think about is to the extent that you are talking about just more supply overall relative to say on supply goes in waves of different markets is probably being a little more nimble on the trading side of house which we were here in D.C.","Over the last three years where we sold about $500 million or so of assets before the reported numbers you start to see, low, flat, negative and reallocating that capital elsewhere into the market that were ramping up, southern Cal development is an example and Northern Cal, so to the extent that you see that you see that sort of choppy from market to market, we might be more opportunistic as it relates to trading and then re-enter our market when we think things have become more fairly valued that's such one thing and then in terms of operations, I think there are number of different things we do, there is a longer list of sort of combat tactics if you want to call that that is quite too long sure on this call but one of the main things that we do is we do look at every lease duration and try to stretch that out by offering longer term leases, which we did here in the D.C. market starting about 18 months ago and so I think average lease duration for example, right now the mid-Atlantic I think is around 15 months to 16 months versus before we started that effort by prior average close to about 11.","So you can always do so much of that in terms of what the customers willing to accept but you price it in a way that you try to get some penetration there and move that averaged lease duration out seeing get get through some of the big bulges and supply which we continue to refine in all of our markets but particularly when you are in little more combat mode, you work heavily on that, so that\u2019s probably the main driver and then you always plan often terms of occupancy and rate and depending on the type of asset and where it is located and the impact on the customer base that shall be attracting, we are kind of walk a fine line there from asset to asset.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","Great, and just one quick follow-up on somewhat unrelated but on Chrystie Place, I assume that you didn't think of the other strategy of buying out your partner, because you don\u2019t want to kind of over-leverage yourself to New York but was that the only reason or was there something about the asset that you think topped out from a valuation perspective?","Sean J. Breslin","Rich this is Sean, just a couple of comment and Mat and Tim in as well. I think first of as you mentioned, yes we do have pretty big presence in New York and I guess about 28% of the portfolio right now. So adding an asset of that size in entirety would be a big chunk for us and consistent with the direction we have had from an overall prospective but the second factor is the joint venture situation, we owned two assets across the street, we talked about redevelop it, you have not redevelop it, things of that sort so you start to get inherent conflicts and sometimes adventures, that it's easier to clean up when you're not 100% clear about which direction which party wants to go and you might have different view based on the portfolio that you have versus your partner.","So I think that probably had a little bit to do for both us as well as just your timing in New York and the cap rates there, if you feel like that you can trade that asset roughly 3% cap rate, that's pretty attractive capital overall.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities Analyst","Was there a condo? Is there a condo application for the buyer there that you know of?","Sean J. Breslin","Not to our knowledge at this point, no.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Ryan Peterson, Sandler O'Neill go ahead sir your line is open.","Ryan Peterson - Sandler O'Neill","Just one clarification question. You noted earlier in the call that during the forward issuance your price was above NAV. Were you talking about your internal calculation of NAV?","Timothy J. Naughton","Ryan, we don\u2019t publish our internal calculations and just to clarify that and give little more context.","A little more context, the reference was true to consensus NAV which was in the higher 140 at the time. So we are not necessarily seeking to validate that NAV, but identify that as a reference point from where we are trying to look at the common equity market. We fundamentally are developing, the funding needs to be made and from an equity prospective where there are only two choices from which to meet them, one is in the transaction market, one is in the common equity market. And so we try to minimize them as best we can and so the reference to where we did the equity forward offering was about a $156 per share which would probably 5% or 6% above that consensus NAV number, and our discount was 2 and 5%. ","And so in doing so, we are able to source equity capital from the common equity market at about consensus NAV and net basis.","Ryan Peterson - Sandler O'Neill","Okay, great, thanks. And then just one more question. It seems like in the back half of the year here, fundamentals accelerated but the economy, while it's doing well, seems to be on the same kind of track. Can you give us some more color as to why you think that might be the case?","Kevin O'Shea","Ryan, to tell I guess we have actually dispute over a few things, the economy is on the same track that has been, it just probably the function of, increase in job growth and income growth. We are seeing decent wage and a salary growth which was a key assumption in our guidance this year that we are going to start to see decent wage growth and like last few months, we are seeing wage and salary growth over 5%, (inaudible) convert over 4% which is roughly consistent with the kind of the rent growth that we are seeing on markets right now. So, we think it\u2019s a good private sector, job growth, ERC and contraction of those job here, a little bit more waver towards the middle and higher income which we hadn\u2019t seen early in the cycle and those things are all good for company that in terms of (inaudible) higher end of the price perspective.","Ryan Peterson - Sandler O'Neill","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies & Company.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company","","Yes, good afternoon. Just two quick questions from my end. The land purchases that were made in 3Q, could you just let us know where those purchases were made?","Matthew Birenbaum","I believe one of them was ability start was deal in Framingham and one of them was actually in suburban Maryland, a deal that might start next year, a smallish garden deal and third one would provide needed the new development right we added in the Riverside San Bernardino MSA. It's actually in Chino Hills. And that was just added that the new development right this quarter but about the way land trades in Southern California that has already got it\u2019s first agent entitlement, you have to kind of land down and then finish your CDs and get your final building permit. So that would be an expected start next year likely. ","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company","Got it, that's helpful. And then in regards to the $200 million of asset sales on the contract, hoping to get a sense of, again, where you're selling assets and what pricing you're expecting?","Matthew Birenbaum","We have two wholly owned assets on the contracts, one is actually one of the legacy assets in Houston, that was part of the auction transaction which is going to be close here very shortly and the other one is in the North East that would cause early in January.","Cap rates on those assets, average is probably high fours.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company","Okay, great thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead sir your line is open.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Hey, guys, just two quick follow-ups. Sean, you gave a whole bunch of leasing statistics. What was the change in new leases and the change in renewals actually supporting the 4.3% rent change in the quarter?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure. Move ins were 3.1 and renewals were 5\/4, blended to 4\/3 during the Q3.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay that's helpful. And then second of all, Kevin, as we think about recycling for next year, I mean does the forward equity issuance take equity off the table next year and or will you need additional equity via asset sales? Or other means to fund the remaining portion there?","Kevin P. O'Shea","We are still early in the budget process. So we haven\u2019t formulated our leases for next year but what we indicated was that we plan on starting $1 billion to $1.5 billion dollar of the developments. We also have the $ 600 million of debt that is coming due next year, most of that is in November and so we do have capital needs that likely to reach $ 2 billion in total, the $700 billion presented is obviously portion of that capital need for the next year. To what degree resource, the equity needs from other sources just remains to be seen, what fraction that comes in debt those questions will be working through here over the next few months. So I don\u2019t really have at this point any inside as to what the remaining capital next year look like and whether it may include equity from the transaction market or otherwise but in our plan is that that $700 million is essentially earmarked for next year even though we potentially issue it now.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, does the ATM, can you issue on the ATM without drawing down the forward equity? Or do you have to draw down the forward equity before you could issue on the ATM?","Kevin P. O'Shea","They're not linked, but the reality is we have got access to equity already today under the forward. So if we wanted fresh equity apart from the transaction market as a practical matter, we go to the four transactions.","Sean J. Breslin","Obviously Mike which is effectively an ATM.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","I appreciate the color, thanks guys.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital. Go ahead ma\u2019am.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to ask about occupancy. It sounded like post quarter end, it had rebounded back up into the 96% range. Do you think you'll be able to, given the turnover trends and the acceptances of the rent increases you've seen, do you think you'll be able to hold that high occupancy level through the winter?","Sean J. Breslin","Based on where we are trending right now, October looks pretty good. But I will say they will probably in the high 95 to 96 range as we go through the fourth quarter, so it may not hold 96% and we are pushing the rents pretty hard and if we are going to get it, (inaudible) taken a little but after occupancy as we continue to move growth potential across the portfolio, particularly in the fourth quarter which is normally seasonally weaker. So I would say here, running the model somewhere between 95.6 to 95.7 and 96 in terms of overall economic occupancy that sort of relevant range we would be targeting.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And we have no additional questions at this time.","Timothy Naughton","Thank you, operator. I just want to thank everybody for being on the call today and I know we will see may be next week at NAREIT in Atlanta. Take care and have a good day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thank you, Melinda, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities' second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially.

The attachment is also available in on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q2 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin, and Matt Birenbaum. I have a few minutes of comments on the slides we posted last night, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterward. My comments will focus on providing a summary of Q2 results, an update to our outlook for the full year. And lastly, I'll touch briefly on how we're positioning the balance sheet at this stage of the cycle.","Starting now on slide 4, results for the quarter include core FFO per share growth of 3%. Same-store revenues grow 2.5% or 2.6% including redevelopment. We completed $400 million in new developments at an initial projected yield of 7%, representing net value creation of close to $200 million. We paid off $1.2 billion of secured debt this quarter that carried an average GAAP interest rate of 4.5% and an average cash rate of 6%. And we refinanced that debt primarily with new long-term unsecured debt of 10 and 30-year maturities.","Turning to slide 5 and our updated outlook for the year, we now expect core FFO growth of 5%, which is down 50 bps from our original outlook of 5.5%. Same-store NOI is forecasted to be a little bit lower at 25 basis points at the midpoint \u2013 25 basis points lower, I'm sorry, based upon on higher operating expenses.","NOI from development and other stabilized communities is expected to be off by roughly $7 million from our original outlook driven by schedule delays at a few developments. Development starts are expected to be about $100 million less than expected. And external funding is expected to be up by about $200 million from our initial outlook, driven mainly by the opportunistic payoff of a $550 million Freddie pool that was schedule to mature in 2019.","Slide 6 shows how these changes are contributing to the revision in our outlook to core FFO growth. The same-store and redevelopment portfolios are expected to be off by $0.02 per share as a result of a higher OpEx I mentioned earlier. Expenses are being driven by a number of factors, but most notably, from uninsured losses and maintenance cost in connection with West Coast storms occurring in Q1 and higher-than-expected bad debt.","As mentioned earlier, the development bucket is expected to be down by $7 million, which equates to $0.05 per share. Our revised capital plan is contributing $0.04 per share of core FFO this year. And finally, overhead is projected to be up $0.01, primarily due to higher professional fees and a true up of long-term compensation metric.","Turning now to slide 7, same-store revenue growth is still expected to be in the mid 2% range for the year with modest revisions across regions. In Northern California, our revised estimate is largely attributable to a new rent control measure recently passed on a retroactive basis in Mountain View, California, where we have three communities that are subject to the new ordinance. Other regions are within 30 basis points plus or minus of our original outlook.","Turning now to slide 8, as mentioned earlier, a delay in deliveries across a few projects is impacting lease-up related NOI in our development bucket for the year. We expect a shortfall of roughly 270 units per quarter on average, with most of the shortfall occurring in the peak leasing seasons of Q2 and Q3, as you can see on the chart there at the left or the graph at the left. This equates to the $0.05 shortfall in the development NOI for the year. The table at the right is really just provides an illustration as to how delivery delays impact earnings growth for the year.","Turning now to slide 9, importantly, lower development NOI this year is not being driven by slower absorption or declining rates. Rather, we continue to see healthy lease-up performance with occupancies running at 34 units per month per community in Q2 and average effective rental rate of 4.5% above pro forma on the $1.5 billion of communities currently in lease-up.","This slide shows two communities that are performing well above expectations. Avalon West Hollywood in LA on the left and AVA NoMa in D.C. on the right, both of which are seeing effective rental rates of around $300 per month above pro forma. The average yield of the $1.5 billion communities in lease-up is currently 6.5%, which is roughly 200 basis points above prevailing cap rates for these assets on average. So, while we may be experiencing some schedule delays that impact current year earnings, we continue to generate strong NAV growth through the development platform.","Now to slide 10, as mentioned earlier, we've been very active in the capital markets in the first half of the year. So far this year, we've raised $1.5 billion of external capital, most of what we had planned for the full year, much of it in connection with the refinancing of maturing debt. We do expect to raise another $400 million or so for the balance of the year.","Lastly, I want to touch on the balance sheet for a minute, turning first to slide 11. The capital activity this past quarter significantly improved our debt profile. Duration is increased with average years to maturity above 10%, an increase of a couple years versus the average so far this cycle. And the average interest rate on total debt has fallen by 150 basis points since the beginning of the cycle and now stands at 3.6%. And lastly, we have little exposure to debt maturities over the next two and a half years, as you can see in the bottom chart, with just over $200 million coming due before 2020.","Turning now to slide 12, in addition to reduced liquidity needs related to rolling debt over the next two to three years, the strength of our credit metrics provides us with plenty of financial flexibility. Debt to EBITDA remains at 5 times, which is the low end of the target range that we've discussed with you in the past. Fixed charge coverage stands at 4.7 times. And unencumbered NOI is up materially to 88% of total NOI. Our balance sheet and credit profile then leave us very well positioned eight years into the current expansion.","So, summary, our outlook for the full year really hasn't changed much. We still expect modest deceleration of fundamentals in the second half of the year with same-store revenue growth in the mid 2% range for the full year. While construction related delays are expected to reduce lease-up NOI somewhat in 2017, we continue to generate healthy NAV growth through development.","And our balance sheet and liquidity give us ample flexibility to support continued growth through new development, while also providing a healthy margin of safety as we move into the latter years of this cycle.","And with that, Melinda, we'd be happy to open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to Nick Joseph, Citi.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Just around the same-store revenue, I'm just curious how things are trending relative to the midpoint just given that we're in early August now and you have some visibility in terms of renewals for August and September?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Nick, it's Sean. Just a couple comments on that; generally speaking, things are trending as we expected. They've kind of been playing out that way for the most part through the first half of the year and now into July and August. So, I'd say we feel pretty confident as to the guidance we provided.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And when you think about \u2013 you narrowed the range, when you think about what the potential drivers could be of either reaching the high-end or low-end of guidance, what are the key variables there, at least where we stand today?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Nick, at this point, it's probably going to really move around occupancy. If you think about where we are in terms of the leasing season and lease expirations, the fourth quarter, not a lot of activity. We kind of know where we are for August. We have pretty good insight for September.","So, where we sit today, if you look at it, current occupancy in August is running 95.5%, 95.6%, that's up about 25 basis points compared to last year. And when you look at availability in terms of what we have available to lease 30 and 60 days out, that's down between 30 and 40 basis points relative to last year. So, our expectation is we're going to pick up a little bit of occupancy on a year-over-year basis in Q3. In Q4 it probably flattens out a little bit. So, for the most part, given where we are with rent offers that are out there, what's being committed and then the expirations that are left as you move into Q4, for the most part, any deviation is going to be around occupancy absent some material acceleration or deceleration in demand which is unforeseen.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And just finally, on supply, obviously, in your portfolio you've experienced some delays; feels like across markets those delays are pretty common. So just curious what you're seeing in terms of expected deliveries in the back half of this year in 2018 and any shifts that you've seen in any specific markets that you'd like to call out?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, it's Sean again. Happy to address that; and then Tim or others may have comments as well. But, at the beginning of the year, our expectation across our footprint is that supply would be just over 2% of inventory, about 2.1%. As we massaged it mid-year, both on a sort of bottoms-up basis and a top-down basis with our teams and third-party data sources, the expectation right now, based on what people are telling us, is that 2.1% is still generally intact, but what's happened is, it shifted pretty dramatically.","There's probably \u2013 out of the roughly 85,000 units that are expected across our footprint for 2017, about 7,000 units have been shifted from the first half to the second half. So the way that plays out is, if you look at the first half of the year, we're running around 44 to 45 basis points in each of the first two quarters, that's going to tick up close to about 60 basis points in terms of supply of stock in each of Q3 and Q4. So, it's basically been back-end weighted, particularly, as you get to Q4, which is north of 60 basis points.","I think what that tells us is, based on what we're experiencing and others, that the number is probably not going to come in at 2.1% for this year, it's probably going to come in shy, because everything that was pushed to the fourth quarter, not all of it's going to make. So, our expectation is it probably will come off of that 2.1%, maybe into the high 1% range, 1.9%, 1.8%, who knows. And some of that inventory will get pushed into 2018. So, the peak for supply probably will be in the back half of 2017, first half of 2018 before you start to see any moderation.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","We'll next go to Nick Yulico, UBS.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, thanks. Just a couple of questions on New York; I guess, first, it looks like your same-store pool got a little bit bigger in New York City. There was an asset added to it or...?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. We had a couple that came out of development, one of which was a two-phased community. The second phase came into same-store this year, correct. And then, in addition to that, there was a change in the basket between Q1 and Q2; there was one asset that was being considered for disposition in the first quarter that was not in the same-store pool. That came into the same-store pool when we pulled it from the disposition list in the second quarter.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I guess, I'm just wondering, as I look at the reported revenue growth of 1.4% this quarter New York City versus first quarter 2.4%, year-over-year numbers, was there any impact for that delta on the change in the same circle?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. The one asset that did come in is trending weaker than some of the other assets in New York City. So it's certainly pulled down the growth rate for the city specifically if that's what you're referring to.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","And then within \u2013 just one other question is, Long Island City, your waterfront assets there. What percentage of your New York City revenue are those assets and how you're thinking about the supply impact still to come, recognizing it's not right in that sub-market in Long Island City, but it's nearby and at rents that are much cheaper than your assets.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, what I can tell you is \u2013 I can get back to you on the specific percentage of revenue from those two assets. I don't have that off of my head. What I can tell you is most of the supply in Long Island City is now coming into more of the central business district, portion of Long Island City as opposed to the waterfront.","There's still some activity on the waterfront, but if you think of it relative to the supply that's been delivered on the waterfront over the last decade, it's relatively immaterial. The Riverview assets that we own there still are the best performing assets that we have within the New York City footprint at the moment in terms of revenue performance.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hey, Nick. This is Tim Naughton here. I think it represents about 1,000 units of roughly 3,000 units. I don't know what in terms of percentage, but I suspect, Sean, a little bit lower.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","It would be a little bit lower rather than that, yeah. Yeah, maybe 20%, something like that, 20%, 25%.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And so, I guess, so you're saying the assets are still performing very well, but is that a function of \u2013 that some of the supply impact still has to come in the back half of the year? I understand they're good assets, very good location, but I'm just trying to understand how they're outperforming within New York City? Is it just a function of the supply impact having not come yet in that market?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Not necessarily. The two assets that we have there are pretty well positioned if you think about it. Really, few things going on; one from a macro standpoint is that specific area on the waterfront in Long Island City has really become a neighborhood over the last decade.","We were bit of a pioneer there early on when we built our first asset and then we built our second asset. A lot of newer, higher price point assets have been delivered into that submarket, sort of buoying the whole environment. And our assets there being a little more value oriented continued to perform pretty well as the supply has abated, in particular along the waterfront, and shifted more to the business district, I would say.","So, there's more of supply to come, more in the business district than on the waterfront, but what comes in the waterfront really is coming at much higher price points than where we are, which just enhances the entire neighborhood.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","And Richard Hightower, Evercore.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. So, Sean, really quickly, it hasn't been asked yet, so I'll ask it just to see if you can run through new and renewals across the major markets for the quarter and then maybe where we are in July and August as well.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, happy to run through some of that for you. So, in terms of the Q2 data, blended rent change was 2.6% for the quarter, which is 4% on our renewals, which has been remarkably pretty flat all year and then move-ins at 1%. It did trend up through the quarter. So, April was 2.2%, May was 2.6%, and then June trended up to 2.9%.","And the range is sort of mid-to-high 1% range in New York\/New Jersey, the Mid-Atlantic, and Northern California. And then it moves up to sort of the low 3% range in New England, high 3s to 4% in Southern Cal, and then sort of mid-6s up to high 7% in Seattle.","And then, if you look at July, July is trending sort of in the high 2% range as well. And offers, if you're looking out for August and September, they're running in the mid 5% range, which is down 30, 40 basis points from where they were in May and June.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. Thanks for the color there. And then, my second question. I know you guys have been doing development for quite a long time and are very, very good at it. I'm just curious, as you kind of look at the development schedule every quarter, how much cushion is baked in, in terms of the delivery cadence just for the reasons that we saw last quarter, where you see some delays, it impacts numbers to some extent. Just how much cushion do you put into those numbers every quarter?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hey, Rich. This is Matt. We do monthly updates on all of our development projects and what we put out there and what we share is essentially what we expect. So, I'd say that's the expected case just like it is on the capital cost side, on the budget side. So we feel like, based on everything we know now, that's our best guess. I will say there's probably more risk in the first turn than in subsequent turns on these projects.","So the hardest thing to peg is always when you're going to get that first certificate of occupancy. That's when the inspections and some of the processes around the local jurisdictions is a little more uncertain. Usually, once you get beyond that first CO, you have very good visibility into when your subsequent turns are going to happen. You know how your subs are performing then. So, when you look at how many communities we first opened for occupancy in the last couple of months, those, I would say, there's not that much risk in the subsequent turns. If there's risk, it's probably in the communities that haven't yet opened the doors.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hey, Rich. This is Tim. Maybe just to follow up on that a little bit. I think, historically, we've actually had a little bit better success as it relates to schedule. I think we've always had deals where you have some struggles as Matt was saying, but they've generally been offset by projects that have been able to deliver early.","I'd say there's a couple other things happening. Some that you probably \u2013 those of you who have (22:04) or whatever, probably been hearing just in terms of just labor shortages, subcontractors getting stretched, not necessarily performing, holding up work. We've actually had some subcontractor failures that have cost us some time.","But a big piece of it, Matt mentioned inspections, the inspectors are stretched as well, and so we're not getting the kind of response that we have maybe earlier in the cycle that you get from them. And the other thing is, when they get out there, they've been more stringent around phased occupancies and, subsequently, on these high-density wood frame buildings where we may have been able to get phases of occupancy in smaller batches, they tended to be in larger batches which have contributed to pushing back that first delivery that Matt talked about. So it's really kind of a confluence of a few things, I think, that are kind of combining here to create more of an issue than we've seen in years pass.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","All right. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And we'll go to Juan Sanabria, Bank of America.","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Just on the supply again, could you talk to when you expect peak deliveries in each of your major markets and has that shifted at all as the year's progressed?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Juan. This is Sean. Each of the major markets going across that's about 16 of them for us, so that might be a better topic to handle offline. I can say it maybe across the larger regions maybe to kind of run through it. We're expecting pretty much flat supply when you look at New York\/New Jersey, and Mid-Atlantic and Pacific Northwest between 2017 and 2018.","Like I said in my earlier comments, some of the 2017 deliveries might get delayed, but net-net probably pretty similar levels; a slight increase in both Northern California and Southern California when we get into the 2018 relative to 2017. And then in New England, we're expecting it to thin out a little bit and come down maybe 50 basis points or so. So there is a lot of deviations at the market level when you run through all those regions, but hopefully, that provides kind of a high level overview for you.","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. That's great. And then, I was just hoping you could talk to expenses. They kicked up in D.C. and Boston. Kind of what's driving that? Is it more discounting going on or anything unusual in those two markets that drove the higher same-store expense growth?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Not necessarily. The things that are really driving our revision to guidance are really three components; two pretty easily identifiable. About the third of its bad debt, about 40% of its uninsured losses associated with the storms we had in the West Coast earlier this year, and then the balance is a whole mix of things. Some of it is maintenance-related cost from the storms, timing of government licenses and fees, a little bit of unusual carpet replacement in some markets, things of that sort. It's not necessarily just one thing either across the portfolio or in the markets you specified that's driving the differences.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","And Sean, maybe one thing. Juan did ask about customer discounts, so to be clear, that doesn't run through expenses, it runs through revenue in our case as it relates...","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","In the case of concessions for new move-ins, that's a contra revenue account for us. The only customer incentives that would be expensed would be for apartments that are not habitable for some related issue. If it's a storm related events or something like that that they can't really occupy their home, then we give them customer service discount for a hotel or a thing of that sort to make sure that they're covered during the duration of the time that their home is not habitable.","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then any color on that bad debt increase?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Bad debt is kind of mix bag of things to be honest. Some of it relates to an increase in identity fraud across the markets. Particularly, it's most concentrated in LA I would say and other parts of Southern California.","It's also related to issues we've had in the court system in the Greater New York Region, particularly, the suburban market where it's not been as easy to get judgments as it's been in the past, where judges have been pivoting on us more. So there's not necessarily one specific factor, but sort of a confluence of factors that are impacting bad debt this year.","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And we'll go to Drew Babin, Robert W. Baird.","Andrew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, good afternoon. A quick question on D.C.; some of the other companies have reported there's been some variability of performance between Northern Virginia, Maryland, et cetera, within the District. I was hoping you could kind of give a breakdown of how that's shaking out, especially as it pertains to leasing in the last few months.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, happy to chat about it. It's Sean. In general, what we've seen is that performance in suburban Maryland has been leading mainly a function of mix of assets. We've got some value-oriented assets there that are performing well. And then that's followed by Northern Virginia and then after that, the District, which has been quite choppy, given the amount of supply that's been delivered.","To give you some sense of indicators, from a rent change basis in Q2, suburban Maryland trended in the 2.5% range, Northern Virginia kind of 1.7% and D.C. has basically been flat. It was positive 20 basis points. So that's somewhat indicative of what we've been seeing and would expect that to continue as you look at the second half in the year and supply is expected to increase pretty meaningfully in the District. So, still expect D.C. to be the softest of the three markets within the Mid-Atlantic.","Andrew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","It's helpful. And then a quick question on New York Metro. How has New York Metro kind of shaken out by submarket this year versus expectations? Has the city itself been a little more resilient than you might have expected. And I did note that from 1Q to 2Q, there was a bit of deceleration in suburban New York. Was hoping you could talk some about that and the dynamics going on there.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, sure. When you look across New York\/New Jersey for us, I think it is a fair statement that the city has performed a little bit better than we might have expected to be honest. And the markets that have been a little bit stronger include New York City, Long Island's been performing well, and then Central New Jersey. Those are the three that are leading in terms of performance in the greater region.","In terms of the issue you identified in New York suburban, one thing you got to keep in mind there is that 1,200 apartment homes in that market. So, if you have a little bit of sneeze at one (29:16), it does affect the basket. And we had couple of assets that normally have nice short-term activity during the summer period that, as you lead up to it in Q2, they kind of kick in late-April, May, and then go through the summer. Just not quite as much demand this year for that short-term activity, which prices at a premium and, therefore, impacted couple of assets in Westchester. So I wouldn't read too much into that when you're talking about a basket of 1,200 units.","Andrew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right, very helpful. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And Austin Wurschmidt, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Was just curious, you mentioned increases in supply in Northern California and Southern California next year. Any particular submarkets that are seeing outsize increases?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","For this year versus next year?","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Correct.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. It's typically the usual places. So, what I can tell you in Southern California, where you typically see it is Downtown LA, and then, if you move down into a \u2013 there's a little bit in the Marina. And then if you move down into Orange County, it's Anaheim and Irvine. You typically see a tick up there. And then if you move down into San Diego, I believe its Mira Mesa and Downtown, you see a little bit of an uptick.","And then in terms of Northern California for 2017 versus 2018, you do see an uptick in the city and there's a few different places where it comes into play. Some of it is not the core part of the city, but you are seeing an increase in \u2013 the Financial District more than doubles as you move into 2018 is an example. There's more in South San Francisco.","But then there's also pockets like Burlingame that there's not any deliveries expected this year, but they're expecting about 500 units next year. So it's kind of spread around, and one thing you do need to keep in mind, as I mentioned, is some of the deliveries that have been pushed into Q4 this year probably will slip into next year. So, it's a little early to make a final call on what 2018 is going to look like.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the detail there. And then, I was just curious if you had the detail on what rent growth would be if you were to include short-term leases in that number?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I don't have that right in front of me. It's a relatively small percentage. And you have to realize that it's a pretty volatile number. It spiked in Q2 and Q3 in terms of pulling up total rent change for all terms, but it's softens materially in Q4 and Q1 and pulls everything down. So, I can \u2013 Jason and I can address that with you offline if you like to.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah, that would be great. Thanks. And then just last one, was curious, when you look at the capital plan through the balance of the year, I'm just curious what the most attractive sources are and how we should be thinking about funding plans for the back half of the year.","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, Austin. This is Kevin. It's really not much change from where it's been over the past six months to a year or so. Obviously, as you're aware, there are three principal markets that we look to tap on the business: unsecured debt, asset sale and common equity. To varying degrees, all are reasonably attractive at a minimum, though among them, unsecured debt ranks as most attractive followed by asset sales.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And Dennis McGill, Zelman & Associates.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman & Associates","Afternoon. Thank you. Just wanted to hear a couple of thoughts relating to the supply delay and then how you think about the year progressing relative to initial expectation. When you look at your own delays and then seeing that in the market as well and still seeing deceleration in the first half of the year, do you look at that as though the risk has just shifted within the year, so the year looks as though you would've thought it would look, but the back half is more decelerated than the front half because of the timing or is the quarterly progression playing out as you would've thought as well?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Dennis, this is Sean. I think, generally, it's playing out \u2013 if you think of the trajectory or slope of what's happening with market rents and, therefore, rent change in our portfolio, it's playing out about as we expected. I would agree that the risk has probably shifted a little bit more to the back half of the year. But the way I looked at is when I see those 6,000 or 7,000 units that have been delayed and pretty much everybody said they're still going to make it this year, I don't think that's likely to occur in that way.","So we had certainly done some things to try and protect the downside going a little bit further out on renewal offers, trying to lockup some people in certain markets where we see an increase in supply in specific submarkets in the third and fourth quarter relative to what we experienced in the first half and things like that that are kind of tactical. So I think we've done a good job of trying to shore it up if you want to think about that way.","As I mentioned already in August, which is sort of the last of the peak leasing months, we're starting out the month about 25 basis points higher on occupancy and about 30 basis points lower in availability that is intentional to try and make sure that we have a slightly more defensive cost share as we encounter more supply and kind of late Q3 and Q4 in some of these places where present some risk.","So, I think your comment about the risk being more in the back half is probably a fair statement if you're addressing it from a supply perspective. And then also the fact that job growth has been a little bit weaker across the footprint in the first half of the year; it's only running about two thirds of the pace of last year. And that would likely manifest itself in demand in late Q3 and Q4, so we're just trying to be thoughtful about how we position the portfolio for those periods of time.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman & Associates","That's really helpful. Thanks. And when you think about pricing power by month when would you typically see the peak seasonally?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Typically, the peak is in July or August depending on the year. Probably would have been July this year.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. And then last question, just on Northern California, when you think more broadly about how that market might recover from early strong increases to moderating, going negative and even probably bouncing back faster in the last quarter or so than we would have expected at least. As you look forward, is that a market where you would be comfortable if it just got back to stability relative to long-term averages or do you think that it can reaccelerate even beyond that just given the demand?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, happy to comment about that and then Tim or others can. I'd say where you could most likely see reacceleration that would be meaningful at some point would likely be in the city just because the nature of the product site that you're building there, which is type one concrete high-rise. There's a pretty long gestation period.","So to the extent that we see supply falling off, say, in the back half of 2018 as an example, going into 2019, that next round of communities that would be built is likely some kind of gap in there, and those have been stressing the system in terms of funding the right kind of land opportunities, blending it with where construction costs are, a constrained financing environment that there is certainly pressure on starts, generally across the country and that is something we've talked about.","But, particularly in San Francisco, with that kind of product type, it might be a little more meaningful than you'd see on wood frame job in San Jose or the East Bay as an example. So, you probably would see the acceleration in that market potentially. It's the core is where people like to live and then it kind of reverberates out from there down to peninsula and then over to the East Bay.","So, Tim, you want to add something to that?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Dennis, certainly, we've seen it in the past. We saw it 2000, 2001, where you had a pretty meaningful reacceleration after a bit of a slowdown in the late 1990s. And obviously, that was on the backs of what was going on in Nasdaq. This is a market that where hiring is a function to a large degree what's happening in the equity markets and it's been a nice run, obviously, in the equity market. I don't think it's as dependant as it's been in the past. But I think that would be sort of the argument or the case in which we might see a more meaningful reacceleration than just sort of getting back to equilibrium.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman & Associates","Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Operator","And we go to Wes Golladay, RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Looking at the development pipeline for next year, I think Matt mentioned that the initial occupancies are where you see the most risk. And how do you see the projects at Avalon Maplewood and AVA North Point kind of going right now? And if there was anything behind at this stage, is there just something you can do to mitigate risk for those projects?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, Wes. This is Matt. North Point is going great. In fact, it's making strong progress. And Cambridge is not perhaps as overwhelmed with supply relative to its history and its context at the moment. So, I don't expect there to be any risk there. There might even be an opportunity, we'll see, to pull forward a little bit.","And Maplewood, that's obviously the rebuild from the fire that we had early in the year and that's also actually gone, if anything, probably a little better than expected. So, I think we're feeling very good about the possibility. That's another one, I guess, the current schedule shows us, opening the doors for occupancy. First quarter of 2018, I would \u2013 we may even be able to get that pulled into the end of this year, but certainly, we feel good about opening the doors there beginning of next year.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So, I guess, would it be fair to characterize what happened this year as more of a transitory issue?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, those are just the two you asked about. There are a couple where there is probably a little bit more challenges. But I think it's a reflection of \u2013 every job has its own unique circumstances, but it's a reflection of where we are in the cycle.","As Tim was saying, it is an industry that is at kind of full capacity. So we have seen some subcontractors fail that we had to replace. We have had some challenges in some of the jurisdictions. So, in years past, we had \u2013 the two you mentioned are two where we might actually have good surprises that might potentially offset if we have slipped somewhere else.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Wes, maybe just add to that, to the extent we can see it coming like months in advance, we're generally able to put together or often able to put together a recovery plan to make up some of the time. It's really in those instances where you don't see it coming like Matt mentioned where it's a failed subcontractor or just an inspection issue, which you just \u2013 there is really no time in which to recover. And that's generally where we run into the biggest schedule issues.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We will go to Alexander Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Oh, good afternoon. Two questions here. First, Kevin, just on the balance sheet, noticed that you have some 1031 proceeds. I'm guessing that's from the Seattle sale. So, two-part; one, do you expect to acquire another asset or is there a potential for special dividend? And two, are there any other Seattle type student housing-oriented assets in your portfolio that you may seek to sell?","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, Alex, this is Kevin. I may start and Matt may want to add here. The 1031 proceeds you see in our balance sheet relate to a sale that was accomplished earlier this year at Avalon Pines in Eastern Long Island. And so, whether or not we're able to use that will be ascertained in the third quarter here. And if we can match with something we will, if we can't, we will retain the proceeds because, based on our current estimate, we can absorb the capital gains that would flow from that prior sale.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then, Matt, on the opportunity for other student-oriented buildings to harvest?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. There maybe one or two others in our portfolio that have a heavy student population. We do have other assets in the market right now for disposition that don't happen to meet that criteria. But that particular one was a little bit unique and a combination of things. So, we'll obviously continue to be selling assets. I don't know that any of the next kind of three, four, five assets we sell probably not likely to be ones that we'd sell to a student housing operator. That was a little bit of (42:29) there.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then the second question is, on the rent control out in Mountain View, I assume this is the standard where there is vacancy decontrol, so you can bring it to market on turn. So, one, just want to verify that and, two, are there any other markets that you think could have this that you'd expect communities to be impacted by further rent control?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Alex. This is Sean. Your first point is correct in that there is vacancy decontrol associated with the Mountain View ordinance. Really, what was somewhat punitive about that one, as Tim alluded to, is there was a rent rollback. The rents were rolled back from current levels to October 2015 levels, and no rent increases were allowed for people that were under leases that remain in their home until September of 2017.","So that's pretty unusual and that impacted our outlook for this year. But, ultimately, as you have turnover activity, you'll get it; the question is what's the duration. So we'll see on that. And then, in terms of other challenges, there has been chatter in Northern California, primarily from other jurisdictions. There's only a couple of locations where it's actually passed, Mountain View being one of those.","And so we continue to keep an eye on it. Typically, at this point in the cycle, last couple of cycles included, there is a lot of this chatter in Northern California and then it slowly abates. So, we'll see how it plays out, but it's right now, sort of addressed at the jurisdictional level in terms of whether it's Mountain View or Richmond or Santa Rosa, et cetera, that pop up from time to time.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And we'll go to Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Just \u2013 I think we probably touched on it already, but just as you look at the changes \u2013 slight changes in the same-store revenue outlook by region, we just talked about Mountain View, but are the other changes that we're seeing here largely driven by the shifts in supply and also, at a broad level, say that job growth has been little softer. I was just curious sort of what are the deltas to what your original outlook was driving some of the change here?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, this is Sean, happy to address that. There's really three regions or markets that are underperforming the original expectation. The first is LA, which is projected to be off about 50 basis points from what we expected, coming in closer to 4% instead of 4.5%. There's really two factors there.","One is job growth in LA in the first half of the year is only running about half the pace of last year. So there has been softness on the demand side. And then, for us, we had a headwind in the San Fernando Valley in terms of some unusual rent premiums we achieved last year that presented a difficult comp for this year. So LA is the first sort of market.","And then in terms of two other regions, Northern California is expected to be off about 40 basis points from our original expectation. About half of that relates to the Mountain View ordinance that I mentioned. The other half relates to performance in the East Bay, which has been a little bit softer than anticipated.","And then, thirdly, in the Mid-Atlantic, the Mid-Atlantic is projected to be off about 20 basis points from what we expected. Just general softness, both the combination of demand where job growth is running about two-thirds of the pace of last year as well as just (45:58) lot of things moving around.","So, fortunately, the other markets, New England, New York\/New Jersey, Seattle, San Diego as an example, are somewhere between 20, 30 basis points ahead of plan, kind of offsetting that. So net-net, we kind of sum it all up and we come out about even.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Great. [Technical Difficulty] (46:19-46:24) is it just the demand side coming in better or is there some supply?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question? You kind of muffled a little bit.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Yeah. Sorry. Just on the markets that are doing a little bit better than expected, the Pacific Northwest being the biggest positive delta, is that more demand driven, just better demand than you thought?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Not really. Pacific Northwest is, to be totally honest, a bit of an enigma to us. Job growth across all the West Coast markets has fallen off pretty materially this year, Seattle included, and Seattle is delivering kind of 4% of inventory in terms of supply. So what it has had is it's had very solid wage growth and it's a very difficult, very tight single-family market. So we're getting disproportionate share there in terms of kind of marginal propensity.","And so, we would've expected a little bit more easing off this year in Seattle. I think us and our peers though have been saying that for three straight years. So there's probably a little more risk in the second half of the year in Seattle, I would say, just given what's happened with job growth in the first half, but it's a little difficult to put your finger on it precisely for Seattle to be honest.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","We'll go to Conor Wagner, Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Good afternoon. Could you comment or give us some color on the land parcels that you bought in the quarter?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, Conor. This is Matt. I think it was two parcels and both of them were suburban Boston. One is in Sudbury, which is a job which will be a start here in the next quarter or two, which is a development that we partnered with a retail group there that's actually developing a Whole Foods-anchored shopping center, and then we're doing, I think, about 250 apartments as part of that same master development. And the second one is the former Hilltop Steakhouse in Saugus on Route 1, north of Boston, where actually there's also a small retail component to that project as well about, I think, close to 300 units, maybe 280 units that should start here before the end of the year.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","And have you seen any changes in land market in the last year?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, it's definitely been more challenging for us to continue to find development rights to backfill. Both of those are deals we've been working on for probably 18 to 24 months at least. So, it's definitely getting harder. I think less land deals are getting struck right now probably, just as a reflection of the fact as we've been saying for a while that construction costs are growing faster than rent. So, it is putting some stress on development underwriting on future deals.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","And given that where you develop these markets are generally perceived to be higher barrier, more difficult to build, that's obviously good from a long-term rent growth perspective, but it can make it challenging for you to replenish your development pipeline. As you look forward to the next couple of years, do you have any thoughts to expanding your market footprint to give yourself more opportunity to develop if you can't make a pencil in the Bay Area, Southern California, et cetera?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Conor, this is Tim. We've talked about this in the past certainly, but we're always looking at whether it makes sense to enter new markets. I think, as we've shared with you and others, we're looking for \u2013 to the extent we do that, we're looking for markets that share a lot of the same attributes in terms of high-value added jobs, just kind of just over-indexing to those parts of the economy, and generally looking for highly educated work forces, attributes that would support new development, and would have pricing that would allow new development to be economic.","So, it is something that we are evaluating, but it's \u2013 I wouldn't say it's not a lot different than \u2013 frankly than we've been evaluating in the past. And then, as it relates to our existing markets, interestingly, the two sites that Matt mentioned, those are both repurposed real estate. And I think that is where the opportunities are going to continue to be in our markets, whether it's repurposing suburban office, which is the case on one of those sites or retail that perhaps is obsolete at this point or not healthy for you in the case of the Hilltop Steakhouse.","But I think that's going to be probably a theme over the next few years. But, as Matt said, I think it is getting a bit more challenged just to make the hurdles work, to clear the hurdles, if you will, just given where construction costs have gone and where rents are today. So I think it's really going to be a combination of things; not meeting underwriting parameters, perhaps getting late in the cycle, and just not a lot of vacant land.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","And have you had any conversations or anything move forward on retail. Again, this opportunity, it's a thought on many people's minds, but have you started to act on that beyond these smaller deals or looking at other retail players or bigger sites?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure. And we have been, actually, in the last couple of years. We've done a number of deals, whether it's Hunt Valley, which was one of the completions this quarter up in Baltimore. Mosaic was certainly an example of that. Assembly Row is an example of that.","But, as you know, there is a lot of whether its office or retail guys out there thinking about their portfolios from an asset management standpoint perhaps even more aggressively than they have in years' past and we just like that there'll be more opportunities to work with them to help repurpose some real estate.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And we'll next move to Rich Hill, Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. Just want to maybe take a step back. You talked about a lot of various different markets, but I want to get your perspective holistically, maybe what markets were surprising to the upside and downside as it relates to demand?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Rich. This is Sean. I kind of ran through the market that we expected to see some outperformance as compared to underperformance this year. It's kind of a function of several different factors. If you look at it purely from a demand perspective and one thing you have to remember is that there's typically some lag, but in terms of where we've seen better job growth, it should lead to better demand in the short run, being the next quarter or two.","Job growth in New England is up on a year-over-year basis, which has been fine and our New York\/New Jersey relatively flat. And number of the other markets, we have seen \u2013 our markets at least, we have seen softening trends recently in terms of job growth, which gives us a little bit of concern about demand in the second half of the year.","So, as I mentioned, we position the portfolio slightly more defensively for the back half when you consider that demand outlook, which is potentially a little bit of softening with the fact that a number of markets are going to see an increase in supply in Q3 and Q4. So that's probably the most crude way to look at demand in terms of what you expect in the next quarter or two.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful. That's it from me. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll next go to Rob Stevenson, Janney.","Robert Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Tim, Fund II is winding down here. I think you can only have like one asset in there now. What's your thought about doing sort of similar type of structures going forward? Is there a situation where you're happy to do it and you see value there? Or given your size and scale and ability to deploy capital at this point, you're going to basically hold all of the best deals which you see on an acquisition side for yourself?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Rob, I guess I'd answer that in a couple of ways. One, as we mentioned in the past, let me \u2013 by being in the fund business, it does create some issues as it relates to being able to be active portfolio managers and we have tried to be more aggressive in that area in terms of repositioning the portfolio. Just given the number of deals that we have in development in the Northeast for instance, we're just going to need to be able to recycle capital there and redeploy that into some other markets at times.","And being in the fund business, when it's an exclusive acquisition vehicle, impacts your ability to do that. So that's one issue. And I guess the other thing I'd say is, when we did the first couple of funds, it really came off of a long extensive period where we were trading at a meaningful discount (56:02) and it was really an opportunity to activate that lever, if you will. And we're able to do so, generally successfully, as it relates to the performance of those two funds combined, but I think, just given some of the other strategic priorities, it's just not likely that we would do it in the near term.","Robert Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. The multi-family partners unconsolidated deals, do those have fund set provisions or are they coming up on sort of end of their life? What's the remaining JV stuff that you have, what's the sort of light at the end of the tunnel there?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","So, with respect to \u2013 I think you're referring to the fund that we picked from Archstone, I believe the termination date on that fund is 2021.","Robert Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","On both of those? There's like one with seven and one with three in it?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. So, the seat fund is more of a straight up joint venture. That doesn't have a fixed termination date, whereas the U.S. multi-family fund with seven assets has a termination date of 2021.","Robert Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","And do you have the ability to, if the market conditions are robust, to sell assets out of there sooner or is it until then?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure. We're in constant consultation with the partners in those vehicles and have been actively, from time to time, selling assets out of one of those vehicles in the past year or so and currently.","Robert Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay, all right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Tim Naughton for any additional or closing remarks.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thank you, Melinda, and thanks, everyone, for being on the call.

Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion, and there are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release, as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. ","As usual, the press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during your review of our operating results and financial performance. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton","Thanks, John. Welcome to our first quarter call. Joining me today are Tom Sargeant, our Chief Financial Officer; Leo Horey, EVP and Chief Administrative Officer; and Sean Breslin, EVP of Investments and Asset Management. I have some prepared remarks, and then the 4 of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.","I'll start by touching on some of the operating highlights from last quarter with a focus on marketing and portfolio performance. In addition, I'll provide some comments on our development portfolio and recent lease up performance. And lastly, I'd like to provide a little color around recent changes and executive responsibilities of a few members of the management team that we announced earlier this year. ","Last night, we reported FFO per share of $1.28, which was up over 18% from the same quarter last year. And after adjusting for nonrecurring items in each period, it was up by almost 23% year-over-year. These exceptional results continue to be driven by solid fundamentals, which in turn are propelling strong portfolio performance. We achieved same-store NOI growth of over 10% for the second consecutive quarter, led by performance on the West Coast, where each region posted double-digit NOI growth in Q1. Revenue growth for the entire same-store portfolio was over 6.5% and was widespread with all 6 regions above 5% for the quarter. Northern California and Seattle continued to lead the way with revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range in Q1. Same-store NOI was also boosted by a 1% drop in same-store expenses in the first quarter, helped in part by mild weather conditions. Reductions in bad debt and marketing related costs also contributed to contain expense growth in Q1. ","Overall, we beat the midpoint of our guidance by $0.06 per share in Q1 with 2\/3 of that coming from community-related NOI and the balance from savings in interest expense. Of the $0.04 per share in community NOI, $0.03 was related to lower than expected operating expenses, with about 1\/2 of that being timing related. Top line or revenue performance accounted for the other $0.01 variance and was largely in line with the expectations for the quarter.","As I mentioned earlier, the industry and our market continue to benefit from strong fundamentals. The nationwide job picture is improving, despite some recent weakness reported in March and higher unemployment claims reported over the last couple of weeks. For the quarter, national job growth averaged over 200,000 per month or around 2.5 million on an annualized basis, well above the pace of 2011. Job growth continues to be driven by the private sector, as companies start to put some of their cash to work in the form of increased hiring. And importantly, most of the job growth experienced over the last year was for full-time positions as the corporate sector converted part-time jobs to full time, reflecting improved business sentiment.","Over the last 6 months, job growth has been stronger in AVB's markets, which grew at an annual rate of 1.2% versus 0.9% for the overall U.S. economy. Northern California is our strongest region, with over 2% annualized job growth during this period as the technology-oriented markets on the West Coast continue to outperform. Markets with a higher concentration of government workers like D.C. are generally underperforming given the current state of fiscal conditions in the public sector. ","Apartment demand is also benefiting from the continued decline in home ownership. In Q4, national home ownership rates were down by another 30 basis points from Q3 and by 40 basis points among young adults. We see this trend reflected in our portfolio as move-outs related to home purchase remained low at 13% in Q1, which is still significantly below historical levels. Against these favorable demand fundamentals, deliveries of new apartments in the U.S. this year are projected to total around $120,000 or about 40% below long term averages. And while the level of starts for 5-plus multi-family is picking up with a 3-month moving average at just under 200k nationally, we still remain below the long term average, which should keep deliveries in check through at least 2014.","And finally, incomes are back on the rise after falling and then flattening during the recession. Median household income is projected to increase by 3% or 4% in AvalonBay's markets in 2012. Combined with rent-to-income ratios that are at or below long term averages, renters should have the capacity to pay higher rents over the next 2 to 3 years. In fact, Witten Advisers estimates that nationally, apartment market rents will grow faster than their long term trend by 150 basis points through 2014.","During the first quarter, year-over-year rental rate performance in our portfolio accelerated from Q4, reflecting the pickup in economic and job growth in late 2011 and early 2012. The average rent change improved by 100 to 150 basis points from Q4, averaging over 4.5% in Q1, with renewals up by 6% to 6.5% and new move-ins by 2% to 3%. Looking forward, these favorable trends should continue to Q2 as offers for renewal for the April to June period are up by 6% to 6.5%, and new move-ins in April are projected to be right around 4%. The West Coast should continue to outperform as offers for renewals are generally in the 7% to 8% range, while offers on the East Coast are in the 5% to 6% range.","Shifting now to investment activity. Our total development underway now stands at $1.6 billion, with one additional community started in Q1. We are active in all 6 regions, and development underway will continue to increase as we expect to start another $300 million plus in Q2 and project to have around $2 billion underway by year end. The average projected yield for those communities under construction currently stands at around 7%. The shadow pipeline continues to expand as well with over $300 million in development rights out of this past quarter and another $400 million in due diligence. While development activity is picking up nationally, our land basis in the shadow pipeline remains very attractive at around $50,000 per unit or approximately 17% of total projected costs. ","For those communities in lease-up, performance has been very strong. Since the beginning of the year, we have started leasing and occupancy on 5 communities and we now have 9 in various stages of lease-up. For those 9 communities, the average achieved lease rent is up over 4%, or around $100 higher than pro forma, resulting in projected stabilized yields of approximately 50 basis points greater than pro forma. With solid fundamentals, rising rents and attractive land and construction cost basis, the next 2 to 3 years promises to be a great time to deliver new communities into the market, bolstering AV [ph] and FFO growth through the development platform.","At Q1, we continued to be active on the transaction front, buying 2 communities and selling 2 more. We completed the final acquisition for Fund II, a $63 million purchase in New Jersey and the total investment of funds stands at over $800 million. The economics and cash flow of the fund are very attractive, with an average initial cap rate in the mid to high 5% range and an average interest rate on the debt in the low 4s. The 2 communities that we sold in Q1 were in Fund I and both were located in the Chicago market. With additional asset and landfills planned over the next 90 days, we will exit the Chicago market by midyear. ","As we've discussed in the past, now that the initial investment period for Fund II has drawn to a close, we plan on increasing the level of transaction activity, both acquisitions and dispositions for our own account as part of our broader portfolio management objectives. The transaction market continues to pick up with total volume currently right around historical norms, and pricing continues to rise with target unlevered IRRs averaging in the low to mid-7% range and cap rates in the low 4s to mid 5s in our markets.","Over the past quarter, we funded new investment activity by drawing down cash from the balance sheet. In addition, we repaid over $200 million in debt from existing liquidity and debt-to-total market cap stands at 20%, which is the lowest level in the sector. In addition, we still have over $300 million in cash on hand and $750 million in unused line capacity. As a result, we have ample liquidity and balance sheet capacity to fund new development opportunities and allow us to grow through the most attractive part of the cycle.","Lastly, in our release, we included our second quarter outlook for FFO of $1.30 to $1.34 per share. At the midpoint of the range, that would represent growth in FFO per share of 17%, continuing the strong growth rate in the high teens we've generated over the past 3 quarters. Most of this growth will be driven internally from the existing portfolio, but over time, as the lease-up portfolio continues to season, we anticipate that healthy FFO growth will be generated increasingly from the development platform, much of which has already been financed with attractively priced capital.","So in summary, we're very pleased with our first quarter results. Our portfolio posted very strong results with double-digit NOI growth. We invested significantly in new development and began to deliver some of the outside value creation we anticipated when we began to ramp up development over 2 years ago. We continue to deleverage the balance sheet, positioning us well to fund our growth and take advantage of additional opportunities as the cycle unfolds. The cycle is still in its early stages, where we have to remind ourselves that so far, we've only experienced positive NOI growth for 6 quarters.","Before opening up the Q&A, I'd like to probably add just a little more color regarding some changes in the executive team responsibilities that we announced earlier in the year. Leo Horey, who's with us today and who's run property operations for over 10 years, has become our Chief Administrative Officer. In this capacity, Leo will continue to oversee many of the centralized portfolio functions, like revenue management, strategic business services and retail. In addition, he'll have responsibility for many of our corporate shared services, like HR, IT and tax. Leo will continue to serve on the company's Management Investment Committee and chair our Executive Committee. This is a key leadership position necessitated by growth, increased organizational complexity and the recent CEO transition. Leo's deep understanding of the business and our company will help make him an excellent leader in this role. ","Sean Breslin is also here today, EVP of Investments and Asset Management, and has expanded his responsibilities to include property operations. With this change, we've consolidated key portfolio and asset management functions under Sean's leadership. Sean will continue to serve on the Management Investment Committee and participate on earnings calls in the future. Sean will be supported in part by Bernard Ward, who will have direct oversight of National Property Operations. Bernard's had leadership responsibilities for virtually every region during his tenure in the Property Operations Group. Bernard's primary responsibilities would be for on-site operations, delivering NOI and outstanding customer service. ","Now Matt Birenbaum, EVP of Corporate Strategy, rejoined AVB late last year. Matt previously served as a regional head in the Development Group and brings a wealth of investment experience in the apartment industry. In his new role, key corporate investment and portfolio strategy functions will report to Matt, including market research, consumer insight, design and sustainability. Matt will serve as Chairman of the Management Investment Committee. ","Other execs will continue to serve in their existing roles, including Tom Sargeant as CFO; Ted Schulman as General Counsel; and Bill McLaughlin and Steve Wilson as EVPs of Development and Construction. I'm confident that this structure and realignment of responsibilities among the executive team will allow AVB to execute on its strategy and meet the demands that will accompany additional growth and complexity over the next cycle and beyond. ","And with that, operator, I think we're ready now to open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Jana with Jeff. I was curious if you could comment on turnover and if -- reasons for move out by the different regions, if you're seeing any changes in those trends.","Leo S. Horey","Jana, this is Leo. Turnover for the quarter was 44%, and it was essentially unchanged from the same period of the previous year. The only region that was down in any material way was the mid-Atlantic, which was down 5% and stood at 36%. The other regions were plus or minus 1% or 2%, so pretty stable. With respect to the reasons for move out, I would tell you that the 2 that we can continue to focus on a lot, and as Tim mentioned, home purchase -- home purchase is about 13%, and over the long-term that's averaged at 20% or in the low 20s. With respect to rent increase or financial for the quarter, for the first quarter, it ran about 18%. The only noticeable changes are that in Boston, Fairfield and San Francisco, we saw somewhat of a tick up on the reasons for move out related to home purchase. And then with respect to rent increase financial, as I mentioned, it was 18% on average. The only big variances from that were Northern California, where it was in the upper 20%, moving out for rent increase, and the mid-Atlantic, which was in the low teens.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I was curious if you could comment on how renters are responding to the new brands. And I know it's early, but are you kind of seeing the rebranding and targeting achieving what you had set out to do?","Timothy J. Naughton","Jana, this is Tim. Really, I probably can only comment at least primarily on AVA. We're actually in the process of starting to really rollout and launch the first Eaves community, so I'd say it's premature there. But in the case of AVA, the feedback has been -- really been very strong. It seems to -- in many cases, at least the initial AVA communities are really, for the most part, redevelopments, with the exception of Queen Anne. And in many cases -- in those cases, the underlying resident profile really matched with the sort of the AVA, with the AVA target customers. So in many ways, it's gratifying to see that the product and sort of service  model that we're delivering there is really resonating with those residents, getting some really positive feedback so far. So leasing has been healthy on each of the new AVA communities, including Queen Anne, which has been the -- which is the one new development ground up AVA that's currently in the system.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Swaroop Yalla from Morgan Stanley.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was just wondering if you can comment on the development yields on your Tysons Corner project, as well as the Vestal Sea deal [ph], basically [ph].","Timothy J. Naughton","Swaroop, this is Tim. When you're -- ask about the Tysons Corner, do you talk about the most recent one that started this past quarter? Because we do have 2. Okay. We do have 2 in the Tysons Corner trade area. Mosaic is actually just south of Tysons by a couple of miles but is in the Tysons submarket. The yields on that deal, generally kind of in the high 6s, whereas, in West Chelsea, and I think we've talked about before, was more of a legacy deal. That's a mid-5s kind of yield. But again, legacy deal from -- in terms of when the land bases there was established back in 2000 -- mid-2006 or '07, I believe.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then just -- I think we've heard from another call that there has been increased turnover in markets which have seen the highest rent growth. Just touching what you answered before, but I mean, so I'm assuming that you're not seeing that in your markets.","Leo S. Horey","Swaroop, this is Leo again. No, as we reported, turnover has been flat year-over-year and I did highlight the fact that most of the markets are 1% or 2% changed on a year-over-year basis, in other words, considering the same quarter of different periods. The only outlier was the mid-Atlantic. It was down a little bit. Certainly, we're watching the reasons for move out carefully. Reasons for move out related to financial is up over historical norms but fortunately reasons for move out related to home purchase is well below historical norms and that's allowed us to keep our turnover constant.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And lastly, what is the job growth projections embedded in your guidance currently?","Timothy J. Naughton","I think the national job growth projection is right around $2 million, Swaroop. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the first quarter was on pace, so a little north of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson from Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Tom, can you talk about what the impact was on the first quarter expense line item from the lack of snow and the warmer weather. I mean, you guys did negative 1.1% year-over-year expense growth, but how much of that is sort of attributable to that and then just how much of it is just your normal sort of expense run rate?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Rob, I'm going to let Leo answer that question.","Leo S. Horey","Rob, with respect to our expenses, the weather really comes through the utilities category. It does not come through the repairs and maintenance, which is where landscaping goes. And just to remind you, in the majority of our markets, in other words, in the Northeast, we're under contracts, so we don't really benefit there. The only benefit that we got from a lack of snow would have been in the mid-Atlantic area. So the majority of it came through where you see our utility results. Overall, on our expenses, I'll tell you that either the minus 1%, which is roughly 3% below what our expectations would have been, was helped by bad debt, which came in slightly lower than we anticipated. The mild weather that you've alluded to. Marketing, we continue to do well with respect to our Internet marketing and that's helping to drive down our costs. And then we had some insurance claims that we received reimbursement for that really held down our insurance costs. When you look at our results in Attachment 7, you'll see that employee benefits costs really is what drove up payroll up little bit, which offset it -- which offset some of the positives that I just mentioned. Did that answer your question?","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Yes. And then just to elaborate on that, can you guys also talk about what you're seeing thus far? You're -- basically, we're at the end of April, so we're 1\/3 of the way through the year -- what you guys are seeing in terms of property taxes?","Leo S. Horey","Sure, Rob, this is Leo again. Property taxes -- as you know, expenses can be lumpy, and we have received some refunds, which have helped. I will tell you that the only noticeable changes -- we've had a couple of assets in the mid-Atlantic market where the assessments have come in higher than we expected and we've had one in New Jersey. But overall, the information that I gave out on the last call, where we expect property taxes for the year to be up between 5.5% and 6%, those expectations are still holding.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then the last question. Can you guys talk a little bit about where you're seeing new rents on your redevelopment units relative to the underwriting? Are you seeing the sort of similar type of trends that you're seeing on the development side? Is it more or less?","Sean J. Breslin","Rob, this is Sean. Generally, the movement on the redevelopment deals is relatively consistent with what you're seeing on development. It sort of depends on what stage you're in. In the early part of the cycle, you're delivering the common areas and leasing spaces and so typically, once that's delivered, which is anywhere from 1 quarter to at most 2 quarters into the job, we start to see a pretty good lift at that point. But to your point, we are seeing a reasonably consistent spread with development.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. So if the -- you guys were talking about $100, and on development your average rent is somewhere I guess around $2400 versus $2,000 on the redevelopment, so it would be somewhere I would say maybe in the $90...","Sean J. Breslin","Yes. Think about it in percentage terms. The 4% to 5% range, in terms of the spread, would be reasonable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe from Citi.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Tim, you mentioned that the 9 assets and lease-ups are projected at a stabilized yield 50 basis points above your pro forma. So I'm just curious what stabilized yield are you expecting now and if we look at the other 11 assets you have under development, would you expect the same level to outperformance from those as well?","Timothy J. Naughton","Eric, hard to tell on the last question, but generally, what we have seen is that the development deals have tracked the market rent growth from the time they started construction. So I mentioned at least for the deals that have started leasing to date, rents are up a little over 4% on average. That's what the rents have been up -- the market rents have been up for Class A assets in those respective submarkets. So they more or less have tracked market rent growth over the last, call it, 4 quarters for those lease-ups. As you recall, our stabilized yields that we quote here before we start lease-up were really -- are not adjusted until we have enough data to suggest that we ought to adjust them. So even if market rents are generally moving within a submarket, we're not updating our rents until generally we have at least 20% or 25% of the leases and sort of cleared the market, if you will. So I guess I'd just say, we're kind of riding the market with respect to the development lease-ups to date. Some are -- some have outperformed sort of the local submarkets and some have underperformed but generally in line with submarket performance, which has been relatively strong just given the fundamentals in the industry.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. Got you. And then for that average of about 7% yield on costs that's in your supplemental literature on current rents, what would be the average margin you're assuming in that calculation?","Timothy J. Naughton","I'd have to look at it but typically, development is higher than our overall portfolio. And my guess is, it's got to be close to 70-plus, as opposed to the balance of the portfolio is in probably mid- to high-60s.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question. Obviously, being one of the largest apartment developers, I'm curious to how much your current developments can cannibalize demand for your existing properties and whether that goes into your underwriting as well?","Timothy J. Naughton","We probably look at it a lot more closely in the case where it's immediately adjacent or a phase deal where the impact is pretty direct. When it's a case of delivering -- in most cases, it's a matter of delivering a community in a market where may -- where we have a presence -- we might have a presence in that submarket. It's not as big of a factor in terms of whether we make the decision as to whether we make that incremental investment. So generally, the cannibalization effect is really taken into account where there's really a local adjacency that really is a direct competitor. In most cases, it's not part of the same competitive set so it's not as much of a factor.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Conor Fennerty from Goldman Sachs.","Conor Fennerty - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Tim, on the uptick in that investment activity later this year, do you guys expect to skew that towards any specific market where you see more upside over the, call it -- the next, call it, 12 to 18 months or skewed towards any particular coast?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, I think you're talking about more on the acquisition...","Conor Fennerty - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Exactly, exactly.","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, I'll let Sean address that.","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, Conor, this is Sean. I mean, we are pursuing opportunities on both coasts, but I'd say in terms of the acquisition efforts probably, we'd skew a little bit more towards the West Coast over the rest of this year. And your assessment is right in that typically, in the transaction market, most of the activity, 60% to 65% of it occurs in the third and fourth quarter. And I wouldn't be surprised if we fit that pattern for this year as well.","Conor Fennerty - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Tom, just on the capital plans, obviously, the cash balance came down quite a bit with the debt repayments. Where do you guys think you could issue today and then how are you thinking about issuance?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Yes, Conor, on that unsecured side, probably you could get a 10-year debt deal done in the 3.5% to 3.75% range, probably the higher end of that range. In terms of secured debt, it's probably 20 to 25 basis north of that, 25 basis points north of that. So I think that we still enjoy great capital markets environment, both on the debt and the equity side. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we have about $800 million planned probably equally split between debt and equity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derek Bower from UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Ross Nussbaum here with Derek. Guys, I may have missed this, but on the disposition front, you didn't do anything in the first quarter. I thought you had previously guided to something around $400 million in the first half of the year. Is that still going to happen?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, I think the $400 million -- first, this is Sean, Russ. The $400 million was what we expected for the full calendar year, not just the first half of the year. And as Tim mentioned, we closed 2 fund dispositions in the first quarter. The pipeline as it stands today is we have about $175 million of wholly-owned assets under contract with our deposits. Those are scheduled to close in the second quarter. And in addition to that, we have one additional Fund I asset for about $35 million. That's also scheduled to close in the second quarter. So that's where we're trending in terms of first half activity at this point and obviously, the balance would be picked up in the second half.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Are there any geographies in particular that you're targeting for exit other than the one that you mentioned in Chicago?","Sean J. Breslin","Not wholesale, no. I mean, most of the other dispositions are more either opportunistic in terms of where we think the going forward unlevered IRR doesn't necessarily match up with what we think it should be, so there's a disconnect in the marketplace, or maybe in select submarkets where we feel like we have a good presence there. We're trying to lighten up in certain areas. So I'd say it's sort of a blend of opportunistic and strategic but not in a wholesale exiting market type situation like Chicago.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on the development pipeline, I thought I heard that the overall size of the pipeline is going to hit $2 billion by year end. Did I hear that correctly?","Timothy J. Naughton","You did, Ross. This is Tim.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I guess the question is, from a risk management perspective, is that as high as it's going to get, number one? And I guess, number two, as you start thinking about these assets that are getting added to the pipeline now, getting completed in 2014, leasing up into 2015, at what point do you start sitting back saying, \"I wonder what the ultimate value creation is,\" depending on what the world looks like, particularly given what the Feds may or may not start doing around that timeframe?","Timothy J. Naughton","Okay. This is Tim again. I'll try to address those. First, in terms of the size of the pipeline, $2 billion -- it's probably going to go a little north of $2 billion. I'm not the one who actually stated the size of development right pipeline. We have about $2.8 billion there. So right now, the organization is geared to do about $1 billion a year in terms of storage and with the total production cycle call of 8 or 9 quarters, that gets you to $2 billion, $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion, something like that. I think just practically that's where it's going to be, Ross, over the next couple of years, assuming market conditions warrant. There's couple of other thoughts about sizing the development pipeline. I mean, a lot of it is opportunity-driven. And by that, I mean, what are the economics of the opportunities, where are we in the cycle, which -- I'll come back to that in a second, given your second question. What's happening with cost trends, both in terms of land and construction costs? The current construction pipeline, average cost is about $275,000 a door and for the development right pipeline, it's actually a little less than $300,000 a door. Now those are -- in the development right pipeline -- and we think both of those are extremely attractive cost bases relative to average rents that are $2,400, $2,500 a month. So based upon the $4.5 billion that we have in the pipeline today, we like it from a land basis and a cost basis, assuming today's construction costs. I mean, one of the things that we're going to focus on as we start to take deals out of development right pipeline and start them is obviously how costs move relative to rents and NOI. So that's one factor and I would say -- I'd say a big factor -- and that's -- obviously another piece of it is as you're getting ready to start, how are you going to finance it, and making sure that you still feel good about the spread of -- both on an unlevered IRR basis, from a long term standpoint. But also just looking at current yields versus new cap rates, that you're being appropriately compensated for the risk that you're taking. And I think -- and then lastly, you asked about deals that's going to be delivering in the 14 to 15 range. We do update our growth rates, literally every 6 months, and these deals need to stand up from an IRR standpoint as well as just an initial yield. Initial yields can change from quarter-to-quarter based upon market dynamics and competitive forces. But in terms of just the economics, we're going -- they need to stand up from a long term basis as well. But I'd point you back to our cost basis. That is a huge factor in how we think about that development right pipeline, whether we're getting overexposed from a risk management standpoint or not. But Tom, did you want to add something?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Yes, just real quick. Ross, I think embedded in your question is -- coming out of the last downturn, we did have a lot underdevelopment and the capital markets turned against us. And one of the things that we learned from that is better matching our capital sourcing with our capital deployment, we've adopted something that we call internally integrated capital management. So as we talk about raising $800 million of debt and equity this year, we do that because we're going to start a certain amount of development. We want to make sure that's better match funded than we were doing in the past. We don't want to have an overhang of commitments to fund without the capital in place to do it. So some of the risk of when you start and when you stop has been taken off the table because how we're managing the capital side, the right-hand side of the balance sheet in a more integrated fashion than we were doing prior to the downturn. So I just wanted to make sure that -- every chance I get to talk about how we're matching the capital with the development, I try to do that because it's important in answering, I think, your embedded question about when do you stop.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And following on that question, how much does $2 billion of development -- how much is that relative to total assets today than it was in sort of '07, '08?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, Rich, this is Tim. I think we actually -- that came up in the last quarter call as well. Market cap today is $17 billion, so it's around 12%. We got up over 20% in 2007. When the pipeline got up north of $2 billion, I think we got about $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. I have a question here. We talk a lot about reasons for move out, and do you guys -- I think more importantly, what's reasons for move in? Do you guys track that and try to compare it with the move out and strategize around that or is reasons for move in kind of the forgotten elements to the story?","Leo S. Horey","Rich, this is Leo. We spend a tremendous amount of time watching our reasons for move in. In other words, the source from which people are coming. It is very sophisticated. It's an area that we invest a tremendous amount of time in. And frankly, it's allowed us to invest our marketing dollars more thoughtfully and more effectively.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So what's the main -- what are the top 3 reasons to move in? Not where but circumstances.","Leo S. Horey","Circumstances. I don't...","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Well, what I mean -- you know the reason to move out is it's the rent's too high or they're going to buy a home. What's the reason to move in?","Leo S. Horey","I mean, it can be family status change. I don't have a specific list. It's typically people relocating into the area making -- taking a job in the location nearby.","Sean J. Breslin","Rich, this is Sean. Sometimes, we just see a lot of it is family status change, job transfer, things of that sort of that are sort of common if you sort of stand back and think about why people move. It's related [indiscernible].","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","But it's not as -- it's not tracked as diligently, it sounds, than move out reasons, right? I guess that's my question.","Sean J. Breslin","Not quite as sophisticated as that, no, but we do have some information available to capture it. It's just not typically as precise as the reasons for move out. So for example, we see it anecdotally as someone's coming in via a foreclosure of a home, as an example, because it shows up in terms of how we screen people. So we have different sort of one-off systems that track that type of information as opposed to the reasons for move out. It's very sophisticated.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then the last question for me is on the Adam and Eve -- I mean the AVA and Eva. What is it, the brand? I'm sorry. I said Adam and Eve. I didn't mean to say that. But...","Leo S. Horey","AVA and Eaves by Avalon.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So, one thing I -- there is a -- you have a property very close to where I live, Avalon in Edgewater, and people in the area say I live at the Avalon. They -- it's very much branded in their minds. Have you thought about how this branding strategy could cannibalize that? Because I think it's fairly common for people to say, \"I live at the Avalon.\" Have you noticed that at all?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, I think that's certainly true in certain markets and locations. I guess it would be our hope that they'd say, \"I live at AVA,\" or, \"I live at Eaves.\" Obviously, Eaves by Avalon is expressly endorsed, so it's little bit more visible. AVA, on the other hand, is a -- it is a different, a very different customer segment, a lot more differentiated in many ways and therefore, it tends to be not -- we purposely don't expressly endorse it. And I guess it's our hope over time, particularly at urban areas, given the nature of that product that they'll resonate the same way with the -- with that target customer.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So what are you -- are you doing like some market testing and seeing how it's going? And what are some of the results, the positive and negative of the brand? You mentioned -- you say it's positive earlier in the call, but where has it fallen short, if at all?","Timothy J. Naughton","It's too early to say on that, to be honest, Rich. But we thought -- we did a lot of testing, before we even started redeveloping or bringing this to market, did a lot of qualitative and quantitative research, ground up consumer research, developed mock units and imagery for residents to -- for prospective residents to view in terms of getting their feedback and literally walk through, do walk-throughs with them, with third-party consumer research firms. Just in terms of understanding the things that they're looking for that drive the decision ultimately in terms of what their needs are. So it's a combination of, I'd say, qualitative and quantitative research. And then you start getting realtime feedback once you actually deliver it to market. So that's what I was talking -- I was talking more about the latter in the earlier response.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Did you -- have you disclosed how much it costs to rollout these brands?","Timothy J. Naughton","It's -- we haven't, but it's really not significant. I mean, in many cases, it's frankly costs that we're going to have, anyway. I mean, from a marketing -- when you think about brand development, I think a lot of times, people think about sort of the investment spend around advertising and making the presence known. In our business, that's done at the local level anyway. You got to do that whether it's an Avalon deal or it's an AVA deal or an Eaves by Avalon deal. So there's some minimal level of cost, just in terms of resigning and things like that, Rich, and having to put a new skin in terms of the website and the presentation to the consumer, but it's not material relative to investment in the deal.","Sean J. Breslin","Rich, this is Sean. Back to your original question about brand awareness. Part of that question probably relates a little bit to scale in the market or submarket where you have one property that sort of stands on its own versus getting some scale in a market, you get better awareness. Just to give you one example, we did open 2 AVA communities in the Seattle market. One's in downtown, in Belltown. One's relatively close to that area in Queen Anne. And those -- in terms of the realtime feedback we're getting from customers has generally been very positive in terms of the look and feel of the spaces of the apartment homes and sort of the vibe, which is what we're trying to create with that particular brand. So I think the sample size is limited at this point, but the feedback we're getting from the market where we've got 2 up and operating at this point is positive, and we'll continue to track that as we rollout AVA in other markets, and Eaves as well.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And just out of curiosity, my verbal slip up at the start, that -- it's not subliminally attached to Adam and Eve, is it?","Sean J. Breslin","No.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sean, you gave a lot of color on the disposition front. Do you guys have anything under contract on the acquisition front? And also, just as you're thinking about the fund [ph] -- I think you mentioned you have one asset under contract. Is there any plans to accelerate that given current asset pricing?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, let's see. In terms of the acquisition front, as Tim mentioned, we acquired about $82 million in the first quarter. One of those was a $63 million asset for Fund II, which was the last acquisition for that fund. In terms of other acquisitions, we do have about $100 million under contract right now that's in due diligence. There's no assurance that they'll make it through due diligence, but under the assumption they do, that activity would close in the second quarter as well. And as I mentioned, the first quarter is typically pretty slow as it relates to transaction activity, so we'd expect to see that accelerate, particularly as you get into Q3 and then ultimately Q4 is where most of the action typically happens. But in terms of the -- when you talk about fund dispositions, I assume you were referring to Fund I dispositions. Is that correct?","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Sean J. Breslin","Yes. So we do have one additional Fund I disposition under contract right now that will close in the second quarter as well, and then we'll be evaluating additional dispositions for Fund I throughout the rest of this year. We have some in mind but we haven't made any firm decisions on those assets just yet.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So it sounds as though you're not as concerned about cap rates rising there in the space in the near term, in terms of pricing.","Sean J. Breslin","What we try to do is take a look at where evaluations are today, but then also take a look at what we're expecting in terms of NOI growth over the next year or 2 and then run some sensitivities as to how much the CAP rates have to move before you get to a point where the bag [ph] and the future looks materially different from today. And we make decisions around those types of analysis as well as just the remaining duration of the fund and how long we plan to hold those assets.","Timothy J. Naughton","Mike, Tim here. The other thing you've got to take into account with the fund assets is just the prepayment on the debt. So that factors in obviously, into the returns in the calculus, if you will.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Well, that makes sense. Second question is more of an operations question. Are there any markets where you're facing greater pricing resistance in the last, call it, 60 to 90 days where you've noticed an uptick? One of your peers had mentioned they were seeing a little bit more resistance in New York and San Francisco. Just curious if you're seeing the same thing.","Leo S. Horey","Mike, this is Leo. The only place where we've seen a significant move in reasons for move out related to financial would be in the San Francisco market or in some of the Northern California. But generally, we've been able to fill it and keep occupancy stable, so it really -- yes, we're seeing some resistance but it's not like we haven't been able to keep our occupancy stable. Through the first quarter, our occupancy remained around 96% and early indications for April are it'll stay in the same level. And then when you look at turnover and conversions -- conversion percentages, we aren't seeing anything that's -- create any alarms for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Martin from MorningStar.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A question on -- just looking at how your underwriting the potential headwinds of -- for example, potential improved home affordability over the next couple of years. I'm just trying to better understand the scenario analysis you might be going through.","Timothy J. Naughton","This is Tim. In terms of -- you're bringing up the issue of home affordability. Obviously, it's fairly attractive relative to historical norms. A lot of that is obviously driven by cost of capital interest rates. So to the extent that changes the home affordability relationship, I'd just remind that in our markets, it's not as affordable relative to sort of national norms. It's one of the reasons why we're in the markets that we're in. It's hard to run in isolation to be quite honest. It's something we talk a lot about. But a pickup in housing affordability doesn't necessarily mean it's going to drive housing demand, particularly what's going on on the mortgage side of the business. I think what's happening a fair bit is renters are saving at this point, and consumers are still in the process of restructuring their balance sheets and deleveraging in terms of the consumer debt, whether it's student loans or other kind of consumer debt that they might have. And I think that's going to continue to be a drag regardless of the housing affordability issue, but that's part of what's a drag on the overall economy. So as that starts to fix itself, you think the economy is likely to pick up and rates are likely to pick up and housing values are likely to pick up. So it's a dynamic process that it's -- we've struggled with how to isolate sort of the one variable in terms of its impact on overall housing demand. It is a variable in terms of what we model, but it's hard to isolate it.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And I guess as you've mentioned, I mean, you're dealing -- I'm thinking about a relatively large development pipeline going forward and having to model and scenario out that pipeline, but also your cost basis provides a bit of downside protection, as well, so...","Timothy J. Naughton","I think that's right. I mean, one of the things we really do focus on is not just the land basis, but fundamentally what product that we delivering into that submarket. If you're the -- if it's towards the end of the cycle and you're the first guy to deliver a high rise in a market which otherwise has been wrap [ph] or wood frame podium product, that's a very different kind of risk profile than being early in the cycle and building a wrap [ph] product where everyone else is building podium. And that's more where we're at right now in this particular cycle.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Now in terms of maintenance level CapEx, would you expect this to rise a bit going forward, at least for a certain percentage of your portfolio, given that arguably there's a higher percentage of renters in the portfolio that historically may have been homeowners? Would it be fair to assume that this group would have different needs and wants that may require a higher level of maintenance CapEx, et cetera?","Sean J. Breslin","Philip, this is Sean. I don't think we're expecting that, and we've had quite a few people move in from homes over a long number of years, but certainly it's been skewed more recently as well. I mean, historically, our CapEx has run somewhere in the neighborhood of about $500 a home. 2011 increased a little bit up to $573 since we started to make incremental investments in refreshing leasing offices and things of that sort. Probably up a little bit in 2012 as well, related to same kinds of things in terms of investing early in the cycle and in our assets, as well as some investments we've made in the area of sustainability in terms of lighting retrofits, cogeneration, et cetera. But I don't think we expect the long term run rate to change because of the customers that are coming from homes, to your point.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. It's just something we think a fair amount about especially given affordability probably gets better going forward here. Rents, arguably in each markets, are closer to their peak than their trough and again, the renter profile is shifting due to just uncertainty that isn't going to go away anytime soon in the single-family housing market. So again, with that renter profile changing and rents being where they're at, I understand the income levels and the demographics of your market are fairly strong, but certainly, it's an issue that you and your peers will have to obviously manage through as you have in the past.","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, maybe just to add a little bit to that. To be clear, rent to income levels and capacity to pay are still at or below historical norms. While housing affordability has gotten more affordable, rent -- multi-family is not less affordable than it's been historically. So I guess I'd offer that. And when you look really over a long period of time, rents are still at or below inflation over a fairly long period of time and so it's our sense that there's still capacity to pay. And they're not going to grow to the sky, but we're still approaching historical sort of norms, if you will.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon from Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just one big picture question. Tim, regarding the realignment of the responsibilities on the management team, do you now feel that you have all the right skills in the right seats or do you still feel like there's some opportunities given your projected growth profile?","Timothy J. Naughton","Paula, I think that the team is settled at this point. It's something I'd wanted to do early in my tenure as CEO is to sort of get the right skills, the right people in the right seats to allow us to really take advantage of what we think is just going to be a great cycle as it unfolds, and not to have sort of a lot of organizational anxiety persist over an extended period of time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A follow-up question on operations. Where does availability stand today here at the end of April? And how does that compare to this time last year? It looked like from your commentary that new leases were accelerating from 1Q levels into April. How does that acceleration compare timing-wise and magnitude-wise versus what you saw last year?","Leo S. Horey","Karin, this is Leo. Availability is probably 30 basis points higher than it was in the same period of last year. It's something that I track very carefully and watch on an ongoing basis. With respect to how rents are moving, on an absolute basis, as we said on the first quarter call, we expected this year to rollout very similar to last year. The absolute rents are following similar patterns. The good news is that last year both when you blend new move-ins and renewals for the first quarter, that blended to around 3.5%, 3.6%. This year, that number is blending more to 4.5%, as Tim had said in his earlier remarks. And then when you move into April, seeing the new move-ins rent step up to 4%, that's very positive. And then when you look for the quarter, the quarter is 6% to 6.5% on the renewals, but when we go out as far as July, it becomes north of 7%. So we feel pretty good about the patterns that we're seeing. We feel pretty good about the forecast that we put out there on the revenue side and our ability to achieve it.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Do you think that that 100 basis points spread that you mentioned on the blend in new and renewals that you saw in the first quarter will persist into the second quarter? Do you think it will be 100 basis points better than last year again in the second quarter?","Leo S. Horey","I think it's going to tighten up some. I believe that the comparable periods are going to become more challenging, but we'll see. But I do believe it's going to tighten up in the second quarter for sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I'll be really quick. First, did you guys already comment on whether or not you're going to seek to do a Fund III to take advantage of some of this strong institutional demand for multi-family?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Alex, this is Tom. I think in the past, and our view hasn't changed, we've basically said that we like the Fund business. We think we're going to create value for our investors. But at this point, being through the second Fund investment period and harvesting in the first Fund, we have some portfolio reshaping objectives that we'd like to achieve and those are best achieved without a partner. I think we'll revisit this down the road. It's a business we like. It's a business that we know well. And I'd say, we're going to hit the pause button for now and stay tuned for future developments. But for this point in the cycle, we're going to acquire and dispose or at least acquire on our own account.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. Second is just in Seattle, with all the development going on there, especially downtown, has that changed your view of developing in that market, either trying to accelerate some deals or taking a pause on some deals?","Timothy J. Naughton","Alex, Tim here. Seattle, as you mentioned, most of the supply or a lot of the supply is coming downtown. When you look -- when you sort of step back and look at the broader market, we'll have elevated levels of supply and deliveries in 2013. It is one of the stronger job growth markets where we think -- generally, when you sort of just look at it from a macro standpoint, the supply will get absorbed. That's unlike sort of our impressions on D.C., just to be clear, where we think supply will rise above levels of absorption for the macro market. So San Jose and Seattle kind of fall -- both fall in the same category there that we think there will be some submarkets that will underperform. But overall, we feel good about the market's ability to absorb the amount of supply that we see coming. So I don't know that that's going to affect the ability sort of -- I mean, generally our desire to sort of push forward on development is being driven more by the construction cost dynamic than anything else. We don't expect costs to go down from this point. We expect them to go up. We've been seeing a little bit of escalation on cost as of late, and we'd like to take advantage of trying to lock in as attractive of a basis as possible by taking advantage of the big construction market as soon as we can.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, and just final -- tom, on your debt side, on the unsecured, I think you guys have a little spacing in the 2018, 2019, so sort of curious your thoughts doing shorter term versus possibly even hitting the 30-year market as Simon and a few others have done recently.","Thomas J. Sargeant","Alex, that's a good question. My guess would be that we would want to -- playing in the middle is probably not where you want to be right now. I think you either be want to be very long or very short. And by short, I mean, we'd like to have more floating-rate debt in the capital structure than we have today. We've done that synthetically through swaps. We have looked at some longer dated paper and I think 10 years is still the sweet spot. But I think if we were in the market, we would seriously look at something of longer date. I'm not sure if 30 years, but we'd certainly look at something longer.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And your next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg from Zelman & Associates.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Just one topic on D.C. specifically. You were -- you successfully ramped up occupancy in that market. I wanted to ask you about your strategy as you seem to be more vocal about the threat of supply at the end of this year than some of your peers. So was the occupancy gain a targeted strategy and what are you experiencing pricing power-wise right now?","Leo S. Horey","Dave, this is Leo. In general, we went into the fourth quarter -- and all our markets are trying to stabilize occupancy as I've talked about in the past. D.C. was no different. And generally, from a strategy perspective, when there is new supply coming in any market that would compete with one of our assets, we would try to get occupancy stabilized going in. D.C. is performing well for us. I mean, the performance to date has been good. The real issue that we're watching pretty carefully is the supply that we've talked about is going to get delivered in the back half of the year more or less, and that's when it's going to start coming and that's when we'll be watching it more carefully. So as we get to midyear, yes, we'll look to ensure that our availability is in check and our occupancy is in check before we experience any additional competition.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Right. And Leo, in that market, can you give us a sense for where you're sending out renewal increases right now?","Leo S. Horey","Sure. Just give me a sec. Renewal increases in the mid-Atlantic went out in May and June, frankly, at about 5%.","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters for any closing remarks.","Bryce Blair","Well, thank you, operator. Thanks for being on the call, and we hope to see many of you at the NAREIT conference in June where we can update you further on our business at that time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] ","Your host for today's conference call is Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investors Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley","Thank you, April, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities' fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release, as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.","As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?","Tim Naughton","Yes. Thanks, Jason. With me today on the call are Kevin O'Shea, Matt Birenbaum and Sean Breslin. Sean is actually joining us remotely. The three of us will -- or the four of us will provide comments on the slides that we posted last night and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.","Our comments will focus on providing a summary of Q4 and the full year results, and then a discussion surrounding our outlook for 2019. Before we get started, I thought I'd just note that we have chosen to eliminate quarterly guidance issue. You may have noticed that in our release.","We've thought about this for some time and have concluded that, so long as we continue providing good disclosure that allows investors to assess our business in a detailed way, which we believe we do, moving away from quarterly guidance is better aligned with how we think about the business and will help discourage undue focus on short-term quarterly results. We will, however, continue to update our annual guidance at the second quarter, concurrent with our internal mid-year reforecasting process.","Starting now on the slide four. Highlights for the quarter and the year include, core FFO growth of 2.7% in Q4 and 4.4% for the full year which was 80 basis points above our initial outlook. Same-store revenue growth came in at 2.7% for the quarter or 2.8% once you include redevelopment. For the full year, same-store revenue growth ended at 2.5% which was equal to what we saw in 2017.","We completed $740 million of new development for the year at a 6.4% initial projected stabilized yield and started another $720 million. And lastly, we raised $1.7 billion in external capital this year, this past year, principally through asset sales at an average initial cost of 4.7%, with more than half of that being raised in Q4, mostly from the closing of our New York JV where we contributed an 80% interest in five stabilized assets to the newly formed venture.","The next two slides provide a little more detail on 2018 performance and I think they provide some helpful context to our 2019 outlook.","Turning to slide 5. As I mentioned before, same-store revenue growth for the year was consistent with 2017. However, some region saw improvement while others actually decelerated from the prior year. Specifically, Boston and Northern California showed significant improvement from 2017, up 60 basis points and 130 basis points respectively, while Seattle decelerated by almost 300 bps as that market began to feel the impact of several years of continuous and elevated supply.","Turning to slide 6. While same-store revenue growth was equal to that experienced in 2017, the cadence of rent growth through the year was not. We saw rent growth accelerate in the second half of the year, outpacing 2017 and Q3 and Q4 by 70 bps and 120 bps respectively benefiting from a strengthening economy towards the end of the year and a cooling for-sale housing market. This provides good momentum for our business going into 2019.","Moving to slide 7, and turning to the development portfolio. We continue to see a meaningful contribution to core FFO growth from stabilizing new development, although at a lesser rate than in years past as we delivered only about a third of the homes as we did in 2017 and completed about half as much in capitalized costs as we had on average in the prior four years. With our starts down by about 40% over the last couple years, we will generate less growth from external investment over the next two years to three years than we did in the early and middle part of this cycle when development economics were particularly compelling.","Moving to slide 8. Of the capital that we raised this year, $1.3 billion came from wholly-owned dispositions and the sale of 80% interest of the New York JV that I mentioned earlier. The initial cost of the capital activity was about 110 basis points greater than the $2.6 billion that we raised in 2017 when about 70% of that was raised in the form of debt. Since much of this higher cost capital was raised in Q4 at the end of the year and 2018 it will also contribute to lower external growth in 2019.","Now on to slide 9. Our elevated disposition activity in 2018 did help drive down leverage. At year-end debt-to-EBITDA stood at a cyclical low of 4.6 times. Our liquidity and credit metrics as you can see are in excellent shape as we move into what will be the 10th year of the current expansion.","And finally, on the slide 10, we excelled and made progress with several of our other stakeholders this last year, including our customers, where we ranked number one nationally among all apartment REITs for Online Reputation for the third consecutive year.","With our associates, we're renamed to Glassdoor's list of top 100 Best Places to Work for the second consecutive year and by Indeed as a Top 5 Workplace in D.C. And lastly, with our communities, where our efforts on the ESG front have been widely recognized by several organizations helping to establish AVB as an industry leader in this area.","And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Kevin who will provide an overview of our outlook for 2019.","Kevin O'Shea","Okay. Thanks, Tim. Turning to slide 11. We provide an outlook for 2019. In particular, we expect core FFO growth of 3.3% same-store revenue NOI growth of 3%. In addition, we expect to start just under $1 billion of new development and complete $650 million of projects.","NOI from development communities is expected to be roughly $27 million at the midpoint, which is down about one-half from last year. This is primarily a function of lower level of completions in 2018 and 2019 and unit occupancies being weighted to the back half of the year in 2019.","Turning to slide 12, which summarizes the major components of core FFO growth. As you can see all of our core FFO growth in 2019 is expected to come from the stabilized and redevelopment portfolio. Internal growth from the stabilized and redevelopment portfolio was contributing around 3.6% to core FFO growth or 170 basis points more than in 2018 and external growth from stabilizing investment and lease-up activity net of capital cost is not projected to provide a net contribution to core FFO growth this year.","The next three slides identify some of the major drivers impacting projected external growth. I'll quickly summarize. And slide 13, demonstrates the impact of a declining level of development completions later in the cycle as we expect 2018 and 2019 completions to be down by about $0.5 billion for the average over the prior four years.","Slide 14, highlights the impact of higher short-term interest rates on $1 billion or so of floating rate debt. And slide 15, shows the impact of higher funding costs on long-term capital raised in 2018. Each of these factors is contributing to a decline in external growth in 2019. Some are cyclical in nature like lower development volume and higher interest rates while others are more of a one-time impact such as the mix of capital raised in the prior year.","Turning to slide 16. The next few slides provide further context to our outlook for the upcoming year. I won't go into them in detail, but in many ways 2019 is expected to be a bit of a mirror image of 2018.","We're starting the year with a strong economy and labor market, but for a number of reasons while we expect the economy to remain healthy in 2019, we do expect economic growth to moderate as we move through the year, driven by a number of factors including a projected slowdown in global growth, the stimulative effects of corporate tax reform beginning to wear-off and heightened uncertainty in volatility surrounding government dysfunction and monetary policy.","As a result, we expect corporate profit growth to decelerate in 2019 but remain at healthy levels. Combined with elevated corporate debt and waning business confidence, we may see a slowdown in business investment as the year progresses.","The consumer on the other hand should continue to propel the economy in 2019. The healthy labor market and accelerating wages are boosting confidence, spending and household formation. Furthermore, demographics and housing affordability should continue to support the apartment market on the demand side of the equation.","On the supply side, we expect deliveries to remain elevated in 2019 at a bit over 2% of stock. And while construction starts have remained elevated over the last year nationally, we've actually seen a decline in our markets, which should provide some relief next year.","Construction cost inflation has been particularly acute in the coastal markets and lenders have begun to take a more cautious stance in the sector. These factors should help constrain supply beyond 2019. So overall for 2019, we expect the macro environment to remain favorable and fundamentals to support healthy operating performance in the apartment sector.","As noted in slide 17 through 23 drill down on these themes in more detail. We'll let you review these on your own. But for now we'll skip to slide 24 where Sean will touch on demand and supply fundamentals in our markets and the outlook for our portfolio in 2019. Sean?","Sean Breslin","Thanks Kevin. I'll share a few thoughts about the demand-and-supply outlook for 2019 and our same-store revenue expectations. Turning to Slide 24, while 2018 job growth of 1.7% or 2.6 million jobs, exceeded most forecasts. The consensus outlook currently reflects a deceleration to roughly 1.2% job growth or 1.8 million jobs during 2019.","The slower pace of job creation is expected in all of our markets, but it is most notable in the tech markets of the Pacific Northwest and Northern California. While job growth is expected to slow, the employees are certainly benefiting from the tight labor market. Wage growth has been accelerating over the past year and is expected to average about 3% during 2019.","Turning to Slide 25 to address supply in our markets, new deliveries for 2018 came in below expectations at 2% of stock, as the tight labor market and constrained capacity at local municipalities resulted in extended construction schedules.","Supply for 2019 is now expected to take up to roughly 2.3% of stock, driven by increases in Northern and Southern California and the Mid-Atlantic. In Northern California, the increase in deliveries will be concentrated in San Jose and East Bay with San Francisco being relatively flat.","In Southern California, the increase in deliveries is expected to occur in L.A. with modest reductions at both Orange County and San Diego. And for the Mid-Atlantic, the increase is driven by new deliveries in the district. While, we're tracking the deliveries that represent 2.3% of stock, our expectation is that the tight labor market will again result in some construction delays. Actual deliveries will likely be in a range of 2% by the end of the year.","Turning to Slide 26. Our same-store rental revenue outlook reflects a midpoint of 3% with the expected improvement in all of our regions except Southern California which should perform relatively consistent with 2018.","We're starting off the year in good shape with roughly 1.2% of embedded revenue growth in the portfolio, based upon rent increases we achieved last year. And for the month of January, same-store rental revenue growth was an even 3%. In addition like term rent change for January was 2.1%, a 150 basis points ahead of last year.","And with that I'll turn the call over to Matt to talk about development. Matt?","Matt Birenbaum","All right. Great. Thanks Sean. I'll start on Slide 27. Our development activity has been moderating as the cycle matures as you can see on this slide. We've averaged about $1.4 billion per year in new starts in the middle part of the decade, but are expecting about $825 million per year for 2017 to 2019, as good deals are harder to find and capital becomes a bit more costly.","This is a good late cycle run rate for development volume for us with starts in the $800 million to $1 billion per year range, keeping our local teams engaged, while preserving our balance sheet strength.","As shown on Slide 28, we also continue to maintain a land-light posture at this point in the cycle. Since 2016 we have managed our land position to be at or below $100 million and we will continue to be disciplined about structuring land contracts, so that we minimize the risk of carrying too much land on the balance sheet when the cycle turns.","At year-end, the only significant land position included in our $85 million in land held for development is a site in Orange County California where we expect to start construction in the second quarter.","In addition to minimizing the drag from land carry, this puts us in a good position to take advantage of any interesting opportunities that might arise, if there is any future disruption in the land market.","Turning to slide 29. We have structured our $4.1 billion development rights pipeline to provide a great deal of flexibility. These development rights represent future growth opportunities for the company, over the next several years. Only about half are conventional land purchase contracts with private third-party land sellers, where we would be expected to close on the land once entitlements are obtained.","The other half are roughly split between asset densification opportunities, where we are pursuing added density at existing stabilized assets and public-private partnerships, which are generally long-term development efforts that span multiple cycles. These types of projects allow more flexibility to align the start of construction with favorable market conditions.","Of the $800 million in new development rights added in the fourth quarter, $500 million came through three new asset densification opportunities located in three different markets. It is also important to note that, we are controlling the entire $4.1 billion future pipeline through a very modest current investment of just $125 million including the land owned and other invested pursuit cost today.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Kevin.","Kevin O'Shea","Thanks Matt.","Turning to Slide 30. As we've discussed before, another way in which we mitigate risk from development is by substantially match-funding development underway with long-term capital. This allows us to lock in development profit and reduce development exposure to future changes in capital costs. As you can see on the slide, we were approximately 75% match-funded against development underway at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018.","On Slide 31, we show several of our key credit metrics and compare these to the sector average for unsecured multi-family REIT borrowers. As you can see, our credit metrics remain strong in both absolute and relative terms reflecting our superior financial flexibility. Specifically, at year-end, net debt-to-core EBITDA was low at 4.6 times, unencumbered NOI was high at 91% and the weighted average years to maturity on our total debt outstanding remained high at 9.7 years. Additionally, as a result of our relative balance sheet strength, we enjoy relatively lower cost of debt funding, which is all the more notable because we issue longer-term debt.","Finally on slide 32, over time we have fashioned a debt maturity schedule that enhances our financial flexibility by reducing the capital needed to refinance existing debt over the next decade. In particular, with over 20% of our debt maturing after 2028, average debt maturities over the next decade represent about $550 million per year on average, which is only about 1.5% of our total enterprise value.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Tim for concluding remarks.","Tim Naughton","Well, thanks Kevin. So, in summary 2018 was better than expected for AvalonBay. We delivered core FFO of $9 per share, which was $0.07 above our initial outlook. We saw rent growth accelerate meaningfully in the second half of the year. We reduced our portfolio allocation to the Northeast and began to make strides in our expansion markets of Denver and Southeast Florida. And we reduced leverage through cyclical low of 4.6 times extended duration and increased unencumbered NOI to more than 90% as Kevin just mentioned.","In 2019, we expect the economy and apartment markets to remain healthy. For us same-store revenue growth is expected to be 3%, up 50 basis points from the prior year. Growth from external investment and capital formation will be lower than past years, due to a variety of factors mentioned earlier. And we'll continue to manage liquidity, the balance sheet, and our development pipeline to pursue growth, but in a risk-measured way as we move further into the current economic expansion.","And with that, April we'd be happy to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll first hear from Nick Joseph of Citi.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Has a final decision to do a condo execution on Columbus Circle been made? And where are you in terms of premarketing and how has it gone so far?","Matt Birenbaum","Sure Nick, this is Matt. I can answer that one. It is our plan and the numbers that were provided are based on the presumption that we do move forward with condos there. Really the next step is going to be opening a sales office. And we expect that'll happen probably in April and then we'll see how it goes as sales go as we hope and we will proceed along that path, but probably, won't be -- yes probably won't be until the third or fourth quarter before we actually see any settlement proceeds. But that is the plan right now. We have a thin website up where we're just collecting names of interested parties but we haven't really started active marketing yet. Again we expect by April we will have a full floor and a tower complete with white-glove ready models to show and a full sales office. So, that's really when we\u2019ll launch.","Nick Joseph","Then how's the lease in retail space going? I think with the last re-lease you are 45% of total retail revenue leased or in advanced negotiations?","Matt Birenbaum","Yes. So there's really no further update since the last quarter. We are those two spaces are spoken for and we're pleased with that. And the retailers in general get pretty focused on sales over the holidays. So not anything more to report since then.","Nick Joseph","When does the retail NOI begin to come online?","Matt Birenbaum","It will start I believe in the second quarter, late in the second quarter when we turn the first spaces over to those first couple of tenants for their build out.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Rich Hightower of Evercore ISI.","Rich Hightower","Hey good morning guys.","Tim Naughton","Hello.","Rich Hightower","Yes, can you hear me?","Tim Naughton","Yes, we hear you fine. Thank you.","Rich Hightower","Okay, yes. Thanks. So, a couple of questions here. Can you -- maybe this is one for Kevin. Could you kindly break down there's $1 billion here it says new capital sourced from a variety of activities included within guidance. Can you -- I see $70 million to $80 million of that is condo proceeds. So, it sounds like you're baking in some level of certainty, at least, with regard to that line item in that $1 billion. But then between other asset sales and then other capital markets activities can you help us understand the detail behind that number?","Kevin O'Shea","Sure, Rich, this is Kevin. There's -- on slide 15, you maybe see a little bit of breakdown on external growth. So, as you pointed out on our earnings release page 23, we have on the top right some summary information with respect to our sources and uses for the year. Essentially, there's about $1 billion of external capital, we expect to source a portion of that. Broadly speaking, there's two pieces of it right now, disposition equity if you will which includes a modest amount from condo sales and the balance from wholly-owned dispositions primarily; and then unsecured debt.","So, that's the capital plan. It's just really capital from those two sources, selling assets if you will and selling debt. What we'll ultimately do of course will depend on how the capital markets and the real estate markets and our business needs evolve over the year. But the current capital plan is to blended mix of debt and equity with the equity coming from asset sales and a little bit of condo sale activity.","Rich Hightower","Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess maybe on a related note, you tapped the ATM the last quarter roughly around where we are today in terms of the stock price. Can you tell us how that source of equity factors into how you view different sources of capital?","Kevin O'Shea","Sure. Well as you know we resourced $1.7 billion of external capital last year. A little less than $50 million or 3% was from the common equity market. So it's been a pretty modest source of capital for us lately. In fact, over the last three years, we've only sourced $150 million of equity out of $6 billion of external capital. So 97% of the activity has been from asset sales and unsecured debt. We're at the part of the cycle where that's a reasonable expectation is that we would be primarily looking at the unsecured debt market and the transaction market for equity. In terms of the ATM usage last year, it was a modest amount. And essentially what we look at is among other factors kind of the liquidation cost of selling assets and what that involves from a liquidation NAV if you will relative to the alternative selling common equity.","And we of course try to be thoughtful and judicious in raising common equity, given the sensitivity that some investors have for that topic. But ultimately, we're making choice on what we think is mathematically the superior choice from capital allocation point of view taking into account the alternative selling assets not merely from a growing concern NAV point of view, but take into account the liquidation cost which from time to time can include property routine costs and tax abatement costs. And going forward, we'll wait and see what the capital markets provide in terms of alternatives and what the real estate markets provide in terms of transaction pricing and what our business uses need. But as I noted before, our capital plan currently contemplates looking to the unsecured debt markets and the transaction markets from a planning point of view.","Rich Hightower","Okay, got it. That is helpful and then one quick last one here. I appreciate the development starts on a trailing three-year average basis are down versus the prior sort of era. But starts are ticking up year-over-year in 2019. So is there anything specifically driving that with respect to specific projects in the pipeline? Or is there anything that may be characterized as the more macro view on development that's driving that? Just any color around that.","Matt Birenbaum","Yes. Rich, it's Matt. It's basically driven by one project, large project the one I mentioned that the one land position we own in Orange County in Brea. We thought that was actually going to start last year. And if you look back to our guidance for last year starts volume was higher. That project is now likely to start in the second quarter. So it's just basically move that one project and it changes the volume from one year to the next.","Tim Naughton","Yes, and Rich, just to add to that. This is Tim. I think we talked in the past that we felt comfortable being in the $800 million to $1 billion range. So that's a level which we think we can start and basically do it on a leverage-neutral basis, based upon what the balance sheet capacity is, when you look at combination of free cash flow, additional debt capacity and amount of asset sales that we're likely to do in any given year before sort of having a trigger any tax-related distribution requirements. So it's kind of -- when you look at it over a couple of years, it's kind of consistent with that that $800 million to $900 million range.","Rich Hightower","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Jeffrey Spector of Bank of America.","Jeffrey Spector","Good morning. Maybe just a big-picture question on strategy possibly for Tim, just trying to think about developments and the comments on fundamentals are healthy, yields remain strong on development. Maybe specifically we can talk about I guess rates. Rates are flattening. Maybe your cost of capital will remain flat and all the forecasts had been wrong. I guess how do you balance between the healthy fundamentals again all the forecasts for higher rates or real weakening economy been wrong. How do you balance that from what you're actually seeing in your markets and how tempting is it to potentially even pickup development or take on more land, just trying to get a feel for that balance when it comes to your strategy?","Tim Naughton","Well Jeff yes, thanks for the question. I mean some of its strategy and some of its opportunity, right? In terms of adding land to our balance sheet or significantly increase in level of development rights beyond what -- beyond maybe some of the densification opportunities that Matt mentioned. The opportunity set just isn't that compelling to really ratchet that up relative to maybe early in the cycle.","I'd say, the way we're managing, it really is really kind of how we\u2019re thinking about risks. We still think it's profitable as long as you match-fund it which we're trying to do. Even the deals that we're starting this year, we think they're sort of comfortably clear cap rates by 150 basis points plus. And as long as we're match-funding, we're basically bringing that capital onto the balance sheet and then it just becomes a matter of execution.","As long as it's match-funded, it shouldn't look that much different than your stabilized portfolio other than the execution risk behind it which is something obviously is a competency of the company. And then lastly, it's just making sure that we maintain as much optionality as we can not much land, try to really manage pursuit cost carefully. If we get caught in the downdraft, we'll have some options. And in the last cycle where you had pretty severe correction, we -- we\u2019re in many cases, we\u2019re able to salvage those development opportunities in part because we didn't own the land and we're able to go back and at some cases renegotiate the basis. But it's really just about maintaining flexibility around the development pipeline.","But I think just given where we are from a capital markets standpoint, we're not -- over the next two or three years, it's not our intent to rely on the equity markets to develop. There may be opportunities from time to time to tap the equity markets and ATM, but late cycle typically the -- I don't think it's a good strategy to rely in the equity markets to being open and available, priced at a level where it's going to be -- where you're going to be able to accrete a lot of value to the development platform.","Jeffrey Spector","Okay, thanks Tim. That's helpful. And I guess just if we can turn to supply, I don't believe you discussed supply by market. Could you talk about that a little bit? And again one of your peers commented that they expect New York City supply to be down 50%. Can you give a little bit more details on supply in your various markets?","Tim Naughton","Sure. I'm going to ask Sean to jump in on that. Sean, you want to take that?","Sean Breslin","Yes Jeff. I'm happy to take that one. In terms of the various regions and given kind of the high-level overview and then talk about the distribution in specific markets if you're interested. But in New England which is pretty much Boston, we are expecting supply to tick down about 40 basis points. It was 2.9% of stock in 2018. We're expecting it to be closer to about 2.5%, which is roughly a reduction of about 1,100 units.","In New York, New Jersey specifically you mentioned that region overall is expected to be relatively flat at about 1.9% of stock. New York City itself, we also expect to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis in terms of deliveries being around of those. As it relates to the comment you made about reductions in specific parts of New York City, just so you know how we look at it. We look at it in terms of the aggregate amount of supply, delivered across New York City as opposed to potentially others may look at it relative to what they think may impact them. We try to look at it more on an aggregate fashion. So sometimes that leads to differences in the way people talk about supply. So that's specific to New York just so you know as well.","In mid-Atlantic, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're expecting an increase in the mid-Atlantic that's all pretty much concentrated in the district, where all that supply's coming online. We're pretty flat in suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia. Seattle Pacific, Northwest so 4% year-over-year both 2018 and 2019 pretty much concentrated in the urban infill markets in and around downtown Seattle, whether it's Forest Hill, downtown Seattle or even South Lake Union as an example. That's where the heavy amounts of supply are located in Seattle. There's not as much in places like downtown Bellevue, Redmond in the north end of Seattle, which has been helpful to us.","And then in Northern California, we are expecting it to tick-up the most in Northern California from 1.6% of stock to 2.7% of stock in 2019 that's all coming as I mentioned in both San Jose and in East Bay. It's relatively flat in San Francisco in terms of deliveries. So it should be pretty much at par there. And then Southern California, ticking up about 30 basis points from 1.4% of stock to 1.7%, which is about 4,200 units. All of that is in the L.A. market, primarily downtown L.A. kind of Mid-Wilshire, Hollywood those submarkets, primarily a little bit in Warner Center, Woodland Hills as compared to Orange County and San Diego we're expecting supply to come down in actually both of those markets. So that's sort of a high-level overview and if you want to talk about specific submarkets happy to chat with you about that off line as well.","Tim Naughton","Hey, Jeff just one thing to add as you probably hear from Sean's comments a lot of it continues to be concentrated in the urban submarkets as it was probably the last year we're expecting urban to basically outpace suburban supply by about two times. In our markets that two, three basically breaks down to about one-seven in the suburban markets and about 3.2% in the urban submarkets. So it's almost about twice as much. Next year, we expect that different scenario quite a bit. So \u2013 ","Jeffrey Spector","Great. Thank you. Very helpful.","Operator","Nick Yulico of Scotiabank.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. A couple questions on the condo project. On Attachment 14 you give some details there, which is helpful. I guess, question is when you talk about the projected gross proceeds from sales expected to be $70 million to $80 million is that the total after-tax profit for the project?","Matt Birenbaum","No. Nick, I think \u2013 this is Matt. I think that's just the number that we have in our budget for settlement proceeds this year. It's cash in the door basically. Okay.","Tim Naughton","And kind of vary a lot based on when the settlements actually happen on how sales actually go. We just had to put something in kind of unexpected case for starters for budgeting purposes. If it winds up being more or less then, we may raise more or less capital from other sources as Kevin mentioned.","Nick Yulico","Okay, yes. I think you said in the past that you expected about $150 million of incremental value above your cost on the project, which is on a pre-tax basis. Is that still a good number to think about?","Matt Birenbaum","Yes. That was last quarter, that was really think about what we think the building is worth as a condo building versus a rental building, not necessarily relative to our basis, although, we do think it's worth more than our basis. But we're saying that based on where we thought the condo values would settle out, if you looked at what the total sell-out would be of that relative to what it would be worth as an apartment building if you leased it up and if you put a cap rate on it, I think that that difference is about $150 million. That is a before-tax number.","Nick Yulico","Okay. So do you have any number you could share on what the ultimate NAV benefit is assuming you hit your sale plans on an after-tax basis?","Kevin O'Shea","Nick, this is Kevin. I mean, I think it's all premature. At this point, we've yet to even commence marketing. So we'll see over time what happens in terms of the sales we closed not only this year, but in succeeding years when most of the sale activity would occur.","If you take Matt's comment about $150 million pre-tax value associated with the residential or condo portion, you just have to apply kind of a tax rate to that which for rough numbers assumed a third is taxes. And then the balance call it $100 million is what we would hope to achieve on a pro forma basis in terms of net profit after taxes to our shareholders when all is said and done when we finally sell everything out. But we're early days in this and we'll see what happens when we go down the path and market this and see if this is a path we ultimately want to pursue and then so what comes from that effort.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then in terms of the FFO impact this year, the guidance is assuming that this project is a $0.04 drag on FFO. Is that right?","Kevin O'Shea","So just to walk through the pieces for the sake of clarity, if you look at Page 23 Attachment 14, we lay out sort of the bottom right of the core FFO adjustments related to Columbus Circle or 15 West 61st Street. So as Matt noted, we only have modest amount of sale activity in our forecast for this year $70 million to $80 million that would generate an anticipated amount of gains of $8 million that would be included within NAREIT FFO, but then excluded when going to core FFO. So you see that negative $8 million shown on Attachment 14.","There are also two other line items that are worth talking about here. The first is expense costs incurred related to condominium homes. Those represent basically marketing costs and operating costs associated with selling condominium inventory. We'll incur those. They'll be part of EPS and NAREIT FFO, but -- and they will burden those items, but then we will add them back and carve that out of core FFO that's $6 million. And then there is the final line, which is the estimated carrying cost of unsold inventory.","Essentially, when we complete this project you'll have call it roughly $400 plus million of condominium inventory that we will have put on to our balance sheet at a cost. We continue to carry those costs and so we will be carving those costs out of core FFO and adding it back. So essentially what we're trying to do with these adjustments is recognize that this is a different business line.","It's not a traditional REIT activity and trying to present our core FFO in a manner that shows our operating performance year-over-year on kind of traditional REIT multifamily rental activities and looking at this Columbus Circle activity as a discrete business and carving those costs and gains out and treating them differently from a core FFO point of view.","Nick Yulico","Right. Okay. That's helpful. But still all the net result here is, it looks like a $0.04 negative impact to your reported FFO in 2019. Is that right?","Kevin O'Shea","No it's just the opposite, adding it back. So look at those items as being sort of a NAREIT FFO to core FFO reconciliation with NAREIT FFO at the top. So adding back to NAREIT FFO $6 million of expense marketing costs, reducing $8 million of gains and then adding $8 million in imputed carrying cost for unsold inventory for net addition to core FFO of $6 million or $0.04.","So the net positive impact going from NAREIT FFO to core FFO when taking into account those are three line items is $0.04.","Tim Naughton","And Nick our guidance difference was $0.05 between core FFO and NAREIT FFO. So basically this is $0.04 of that $0.05.","Kevin O'Shea","Yes.","Nick Yulico","Okay. All right, we get a lag of 0.5. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill","Hey good morning guys. Wanted to maybe spend just little bit more time on your development pipeline, recognize why development might be coming down late cycle and clearly see it as prudent. But there's still likely some markets that need new supply of apartments.","So I'm curious when you're thinking about your development pipeline, what land you have under option, where you're already developing? How do you sort of think about that relative to your existing portfolio?","Matt Birenbaum","Rich, it's Matt. I'll try and take a shot at that one. It is somewhat bottom-up as Tim was mentioning. So it really starts with where we're seeing the best risk-adjusted opportunities? Where are the economics of development still favorable?","Typically that's going to be a wood frame product at this point in the cycle. I don't think we have any -- all of our starts planned for this year are high density wood frame product and everything we started last year, except one, fit that description as well.","Typically they're in kind of infill suburban locations, where demand is strong and there are more supply constraints than the urban submarkets. So it takes a little longer to get through the process and that tends to meet or out supply in a more measured way which is one reason those submarkets aren't necessarily seeing the same pressure on rents, although urban markets actually have seen rents rebound here recently a little bit.","But generally speaking rents have held up a little better over the last couple of years. So, we are seeing some of the suburban Northeast deals still pencil out. This past quarter we added a development right in Long Island. It's probably a 2 year to 3 year entitlement process. Those types of deals tend to be pretty resistant to the cycles. So still be favorable.","And then we're seeing opportunities in our own portfolio, locations where we already are and again as I mentioned we have six densification development rights now which is $1 billion in locations that we love, where we have the opportunity to do more over time.","It's going to take a while to get at those. They're complicated from entitlement point of view, but we have one in Redmond. We have one in Mountain View. We have one in Suburban Boston. So those are great things, where the economics are likely to work through most market cycles.","And then we are also trying to find opportunities in the expansion markets and we started a deal in Florida last year in Doral. We have our first ground-up development right in the Denver market, which is in RiNo, which is kind of a very hot neighborhood outside of downtown there, but it's a wood-frame product that we hope to start this year. So those are kind of the places where it's still making it through the screen.","Tim Naughton","Yes, Rich. I think, sort of, probably the three areas where we haven't been as active, because of just cycle dynamics has been the Bay Area. We just haven't used land and construction costs, generally doesn't make new development feasible from our standpoint. Densification is a different kind of opportunity. So within our portfolio we've been able to do that.","Seattle, I think, is where we haven't been that active in the land markets the last three years. And then most urban submarkets, again, due to concrete, generally doesn't pencil later in the cycles. So those are -- we try to blend sort of where we want to be, where we want to be from a portfolio allocation standpoint, use development to help us get there, but to recognize there are times in the cycle where something just doesn't pencil, which doesn\u2019t make -- this is not as good a use of capital as other places.","Rich Hill","Got it. And what I'm ultimately getting at, sort of, sounds like your development pipeline is nice to have and not need to have. I was struck by your growth being driven by stabilized portfolio with new contribution coming from new investment activity.","So it sounds like, the development pipeline is a nice to have. It's in areas that you think really still need supply. But even if the development went away as we start to think about 2019 and beyond, your stabilized portfolio can grow consistent with peers. Is that sort of fair in the way you're thinking about it?","Tim Naughton","Our outlook. I mean, our outlook for this year probably is somewhere in the middle of where kind of our peers are, just glancing at it real quickly. So we're in 20%, 25% of the U.S. which a lot of our peers are in the same markets. So the notion that we might perform similar in terms of same-store basis, I think, is a reasonable expectation.","I would say on the development, I wouldn\u2019t say it's a nice to have, but we think it makes sense to have. So at this point in the cycle albeit a lesser amount and being judicious about where you're deploying that capital. We think we -- this year is a really, is an anomaly, just for what's happening both on the delivery side and the capital that was raised in 2018.","But we still think it's accretive both on a go-forward basis, accretive to both NAV and FFO, in particular as you consider sort of reinvesting free cash flow which doesn't have at least an initial financial cost to it, accounting cost to it. So we think we can still grow accretively both from an earnings standpoint by continuing with our development pipeline and the opportunity set that we see.","Rich Hill","Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. You guys pointed out that your cost of capital in the past year is up about 110 basis points versus 2017 and I was just curious what are you factoring into guidance for the $1 billion you've assumed in your capital plan in 2019?","Kevin O'Shea","Austin, this is Kevin. We've never commented on that before. We actually typically don't comment on capital markets. So by even showing the 50-50 blend of asset sales and unsecured debt, we're doing something we've never done in our 25-year history. Essentially to bite into our budget process, but we\u2019re essentially assuming that we're going to achieve kind of market rate execution on transaction activity and unsecured debt issuance over the course of 2019.","Tim Naughton","Kevin on the debt, we typically would just look at the forward curve and\u2026","Kevin O'Shea","Make some adjustments.","Tim Naughton","Make some adjustments of that.","Kevin O'Shea","Yes.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks. Appreciate that. And then just curious what the attractiveness today is for redevelopment as you have seen rental rate growth improve albeit gradually, and given the decrease in development starts moving forward.","Tim Naughton","Yes. Thanks, Austin. Sean you want to take that?","Sean Breslin","Sure. Happy to do so. Yes, Austin. I mean, development -- excuse me, redevelopments been pretty active for us. We invested almost $200 million in the past year across about 7,300 homes. A chunk of that related to the rebuild at Avalon headquarters about $70 million, but still around 7,000 units that redeveloped last year.","And in terms of planning forward going forward, I'd probably think about we're going to spend somewhere in the range of $150 million to $200 million a year over the next couple of years on redevelopment activity. And then beyond that it will breaks out a little bit, but the returns have been compelling and the opportunity set has been something that we're comfortable with. So that's kind of where we are.","Austin Wurschmidt","And how do you think about the returns on those and is the majority moving forward more kitchen and bath-type opportunities versus I guess the redevelopment Edgewater a little bit of a different animal?","Sean Breslin","Yes. Edgewater is certainly that was sort of a one-time thing. The rest of it is a combination of either full scale redevelopments where we're doing not only the apartment homes, we're doing the common areas. It includes some projects that are just purely large CapEx projects, that really just not generating any kind of incremental return. It's just CapEx.","And then there are other projects which we call apartment only, which are just touching the apartment homes. And so when you look at the redevelopment activity and the apartment-only activity, typically we're seeing returns that are sort of in the 10% on capital type range based on the enhancements that are being invested in the building. And again, as I said, the CapEx side of it is probably something you just underwrite basically zero, but in terms of apartment-only [indiscernible], they generate nice returns.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thanks for the time.","Sean Breslin","Yes.","Operator","Drew Babin of Baird.","Drew Babin","Hey, good morning. Presumably looking out to 2020 as more of the condos in Columbus Circle are sold the gains on sale number will increase. And I think that the positive add-back between NAREIT FFO and core FFO should go negative, I'm assuming. Will that the apartment NOI that you would have been getting from the project is replaced with these gains, which would be backed out of core FFO. I guess, the difference is now you have more cash coming in that can be reinvested. Do you think the reinvestment of that cash will occur rapidly enough to kind of offset the dilution to core FFO that would be happening in 2020 to see if you sold the condos and kind of how that is cash if that makes sense?","Kevin O'Shea","Yes. Drew, this is Kevin. I'll make a couple of comments and I'll let Tim maybe want to add on top of that. So essentially to extent we generate gains on selling condominiums that will boost NAREIT FFO and of course as it would we would be true for other real estate gains. We will exclude those gains when computing for FFO.","From an underlying cash point of view, certainly all else equal, we would prefer to sell through the condos quickly and receive the capital back so that we can reinvest it, and generate a return on that. And then that return, of course, will flow through naturally as any source of capital would in our earnings.","In the meantime, while we have our inventory outstanding in terms of capital, we created these condominiums. We're marketing them. We're bearing cost for having created those condominiums, but we've not yet sold them. Potentially that creates an inventory cost if you will and we are adjusting for that as you can see on Attachment 14, where we have $8 million imputed carrying costs on the capital associated with the unsold inventory condominiums that were calculating at corporate unsecured borrowing rate, which is about 3.7% today.","So essentially that's in add-back to core FFO from NAREIT FFO during the pendency of the cell process while the inventories and our balance sheet and not otherwise earning a return.","I don't know Tim if you want to add.","Tim Naughton","Yeah. I mean, obviously, as we sell the amount of unsold inventory goes down so carrying cost adjustment would go down with it.","Kevin O\u2019Shea","Yeah.","Tim Naughton","Secondly, Drew, I would just think of this as just more disposition capital. And so just means we're going to sell less assets than we otherwise would. So in terms of how quickly you get to deploy and yeah we get deployed presumably as quickly as any other asset that we sell. So I don't know that you need to really think differently in terms of how you model it's just a source of capital and cash as Kevin mentioned.","Drew Babin","That's very helpful detail. The other question I have here is, if you look on at least my numbers, total NOI for 2018 not same-store was up just over 6%. Corporate overhead, property management, investment management expenses all increased and this is on adjusted for severance and things like that but in the double digits.","And then based on guidance for 2019 it looks like that rate moderates quite a bit. So I'm guessing where the large investments internally, I'm kind of sourcing some of these development projects or things like that in 2018 are explicitly going away in 2019? Or is there anything going on behind the scenes there causing that variability?","Kevin O\u2019Shea","Well, in terms of 2018 there are a number of factors that drove overhead over costs up. You did have as you may recall rent occupancy costs that were included in PMOH, which is part of the overhead that's referenced in our Attachment 14 for our outlook.","G&A increased for a number of reasons. Compensation was part of it but there were some settlements in estate sales used tax accruals and then there was some severance costs. So -- and at the same time there's also been historically some investment in some strategic initiatives, which will certainly and are bearing fruit on the operating side and Sean could speak to.","So there's a number of drivers of growth that we've had over the past couple of years that are starting to abate, which is why you're seeing that relative decline in year-over-year growth in overhead, which I think is about 2% to 7% based on the math in Attachment 14.","Drew Babin","Okay. That\u2019s all very helpful. That\u2019s all for me. Thank you.","Operator","John Kim with BMO Capital Market has our next question.","John Kim","Thank you. So you have development starts picking up this year, but there's still a noticeable gap between the construction costs growth rate and rental growth. So I'm wondering if you believe that gap will narrow as you go through the development pipeline. And if not, how will that impact yield?","Matt Birenbaum","Sure, John this is Matt. It's a good question, and certainly one we've been watching. It does feel like construction costs growth in some markets has moderated somewhat. And again this speaks to the mix of business. As Tim was mentioning before, we signed a very few new development rights in Northern Cal and Seattle over the last three, four years and we have very key starts in those two regions. In fact, we don't have any Northern Cal last year or this year. And that's really a function of the reality, if that's the market -- if those of the markets that have seen the most aggressive hard costs growth relative to their rent growth.","So it does affect the regional mix. And again, I mentioned some of these northeastern markets, a lot more stable and the gap between construction cost growth and rent growth is not nearly as wide, but it does put downward pressure on margins and that's one reason the volume is down.","John Kim","On your dispositions that you've executed last year, it was the highest amount that you\u2019ve sold, the lowest cap rates, but also you have the lower IRR compared to what you achieved historically. Is there anything unusual in what you sold last year that brought down that figure?","Matt Birenbaum","Yes this is Matt again. It really is kind of a mix from one year to another. So I wouldn't kind of infer anything from kind of the basket that happens to be one year versus another.","The one thing that we do tend to see as it gets later in the cycle, there's probably more pressure on us to sell assets with a little bit lower tax gains because we just had kind of a long cycle of realizing gains and that essentially puts pressure on our dividend coverage.","So again, there's plenty of other assets we could sell that would have higher returns, but they might generate enough tax gains that it would require a special dividend. So that's definitely more of a consideration later in the cycle.","And then also to some extent we start looking for assets which may be are little bit more difficult in terms of the execution and calling some of the ones that maybe weren't our greatest successes, where it's easier to do that in a very strong sales market like what we've seen recently.","John Kim","Okay. And then a final question. I guess Tim you mentioned in your prepared remarks at the beginning that you're moving away from quarterly guidance. And I'm wondering if it ended up being too distracting to manage that quarterly number? And generally speaking, what do you think about quarterly reporting and whether or not that's completely necessary?","Tim Naughton","Well, I don't have a view necessarily on quarterly report. We continue to issue quarterly reports. It's just -- it really comes down to how we kind of manage the business.","When we talk amongst ourselves and to our board, we're not talking about managing the business to what's happening in the quarter and try to minimize variances relative to our budget or explain variances relative to our budget on a quarter-over-quarter basis.","When it comes to revenue, we're looking at that, daily and weekly. I mean -- but when it comes to sort of the overall earnings, there's just a lot of noise from quarter-to-quarter. And just -- we don't think it really serves a great purpose ultimately for our investors to be trying to -- always trying to sync up and explain and reconcile, what we think is often times is noise. So that's -- as much anything that\u2019s driving it.","John Kim","Thank you very much.","Operator","Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning down there. So two questions. Just first, on the condo project Columbus Circle or I guess 15 West 61st, just -- with some of the recent articles about sort of weakness I mean today in the Journal they have the article on weakness under the $5 million price point.","Can you just talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking about pricing for the project now versus maybe last year when you were contemplating switching it to condos?","And then how much flexibility do you have once you set price? Or it sort of a fluctuating factor as you go forward with the sales process to try and hit that target number of units that you want to sell before fully committing?","Matt Birenbaum","Yeah. Hi, Alex its Matt. It's definitely a dynamic process. So we can change pricing weekly. You have to file your offering plan with the Attorney General with your initial pricing. And once you've done that, obviously you have the flexibility to meet the market, however you choose to do so and that's just like we change our rents every day. We'll be watching that very closely once we launch for-sale. Yeah, the market is definitely as we talked about last quarter, it's softer than it was, call it 18 months ago. And the slowdown had more been at the higher price points. There might be some softness now a little bit more in the moderate price points.","So I think most market experts would tell you, if the product had been available to sell and settle in 2017, it would probably sell for higher price than where we sell today, but the price \u2013 we believe it will sell today is still very attractive relative to the values of the rental building. But again, we'll know a lot more in probably four, five months once we actually get some sales activity underway.","Tim Naughton","Yeah, Alex, just I don't know if you had a split or remember \u2013 a little over 80% of the units are actually scheduled to be less than $5 million where as Matt mentioned, its kind of the higher end and it's feeling more of the softness. So one of the things that we like about potential condo execution here is we think it's a unique offering particularly in that submarket where units tend to be larger and much more expensive in terms of total price.","So we think we're going to be competing against \u2013 other neighborhoods that maybe offering a little bit larger unit, but not near the location and lifestyle amenities that this site has. So it's \u2013 ultimately, the market will determine whether that strategy is a successful one, but we do think it's positioned relatively uniquely to everything else that's out there. Plus, it's going to be available versus buying off a plan so.","Alexander Goldfarb","Right. Tim, yeah, that's why I asked the question, because the Journal article referenced that under $5 million price point is being now softer. The second question is on the development sort of going back one of the earlier questions was on sort of the external development is \u2013 the benefits for that are offset by the funding. So, assuming that the economy sort of stays as is, would it make sense to curtail the development pipeline even more? I'm just thinking from risk-reward perspective, if you're not being paid for it as far as boosting earnings growth from a risk perspective, why not curtail the development program even more than where it is right now if it's not adding to your earnings growth?","Tim Naughton","Maybe, I'll take \u2013 I mean, I think I did mention earlier this is an unusual year. This is unique year and I mentioned that to an earlier question that we do expect it to add to our earnings growth and NAV growth that we do see it as accretive. And there is just some unusual things about the cadence of deliveries this year. It's only generating the midpoint development NOIs is $27 million, which was half of what was generated, the prior year. A lot of that has to do with the combination of Columbus Circle, but mainly the cadence of deliveries this year, which is largely back-half weighted. So a lot of that capital is already raised and was raised in Q4. It was raised in the form of disposition. It was raised at \u2013 ","Kevin O'Shea","Yeah.","Tim Naughton","As I mentioned, it sort of \u2013 at a 5%. So I think there is some unique things happening. And then, if you look at what \"unfunded or not match-funded\", it's pretty small relative to our remaining liquidity where we have zero out on $1.5 billion line. So we think from a risk standpoint, it's pretty -- it's already pretty measured.","Matt Birenbaum","If you look at Attachment 9, the development attachment, I don't remember the last time, only three of those deals are basically in lease-up right now, and fourth, just starting out of 21 deals. It's just an odd schedule.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Hardik Goel of Zelman & Associates.","Hardik Goel","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just on The Meadows acquisition, I see that 2018 build in relatively suburban sourced area, do you see a situation in the future where there's a lot of merchant built sort of product coming on the market that you could acquire at a small premium to replacement cost and you would rather do that than develop ground up if it's in the right area?","Matt Birenbaum","Yes, hi Hardik, it's Matt. Definitely we're doing that. If you look at what we've been buying in Denver and in Florida and even the one deal we bought last year near BWI Airport, they all fit that description. They were brand-new assets built by merchant builders where the premium to replacement cost was pretty modest. I don't necessarily view it as an either or, I think it's kind of an and.","But those are deals where certainly on the development deals we're doing in those markets, we're looking for a bigger margin, obviously, because there's more risk involved, but we think that's a great way to add to our portfolio and certainly we're doing more of that than we are development in those markets where we're doing some of each.","Hardik Goel","Could there be a trade-off though in the future where you see more of these opportunities come up and you pare back development and maybe put that capital in acquisition? And I understand the cadence is different because of development. It's more a little bit at a time rather than acquisition you need to come up with capital right away.","Tim Naughton","Yes, I think it's a hard one to answer. Not every cycle is the same. This cycle was particularly attractive from a development economic standpoint. Some cycles may not yield quite the development opportunity as others and therefore, you might be inclined to allocate more capital to acquisitions on a risk-adjusted basis. So, if the returns right there on a risk-adjusted basis then we're not going to allocate capital towards that activity. We'll allocate it somewhere else or not deploy it, raise it in the first place.","Hardik Goel","And just lastly, thanks for indulging me. On the Harrison deal, could you highlight how you found that deal and like what the process was like and why you picked that specific location?","Matt Birenbaum","Sure. That was actually a public-private partnership. We broke out the Denver assets that way. Of course for the first time that would have been in the public-private partnership bucket.","Tim Naughton","With MCA.","Matt Birenbaum","We've been showing it that way for the last couple of years. So, it was with the MTA literally at the train station in Harrison. It was a long process. I think we've been working on that deal for at least five years. And there's significant amount of retail there as well as residential, very infill, very high barrier to entry location in Westchester County.","Honestly, we had hoped that there might be more of those at those train stations, but it's just a very, very difficult process between the state and the local jurisdictions. So, I'm not sure how many more of those we're going to see.","Hardik Goel","Perfect. That's all from me. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next we'll hear from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","Yes. Good afternoon. Question, do you guys put any impact of Amazon's HQ2 into the numbers for 2019 guidance? And if you don't, can you just kind of talk generally about how you think about how that could impact numbers?","Tim Naughton","Yes, Tayo, this is Tim. I mean, certainly, when we look at sort of job growth projections, we rely a lot on third parties. And certainly to some extent they're incorporating a little bit of Amazon, the Amazon effect. I think -- honestly, I think potentially, the opportunity may be more in Virginia than the -- may be more in Virginia than D.C. properties, may be some of the knock-on effects of just Amazon coming in, like a lot of other technologies companies already doing, whether it's Apple or Google, Facebook are looking well beyond Seattle and Silicon Valley for talent and establishing beachheads and other markets where there's a depth of technology talent. So I think the HQ decision just sort of validated when you look -- where the finals where ultimately they chose, where they thought there was depth of talent. And ultimately, it'll be more of a magnet I think for potentially other technology companies. So we'll see. I think nationals are huge winner in this as well by the way, its only 5,000 jobs, but I think it might have as big of an impact maybe kind of that market just given the size of the market.","Tayo Okusanya","Got you. And then 2019 guidance while you don't explicitly talk about acquisitions, could you just talk a little bit about kind of what you may expect to see? And then two, if the focus is still on building your presence in Denver and Florida?","Matt Birenbaum","Yes, Tayo, it's Matt. Exactly. We'll see. We don't specifically include any number for acquisitions in our guidance just because it's so unpredictable. To the extent, we find deals we like then we will fund that likely with incremental dispositions, which is what we've been doing the last couple of years and sometimes we do that through tax-free exchanges. So neither acquisitions or dispositions are reflecting the capital plan per se, but our primary focus is going to continue to be Denver and Southeast Florida.","Tayo Okusanya","Got you. So the $1 billion you have is that all in guidance for sources of funding? That's all just condo sales?","Kevin O'Shea","No. So Tayo this is Kevin. So essentially, conceptually, we sell assets for one of two reasons. One is to fund development. The other is as Matt -- related to kind of paired trade basis to help fund acquisition activity. We don't have any acquisitions in our budget for the year and so correspondingly we don't have any related disposition activity paired with acquisitions in our capital plan. However, the external capital of $1 billion which represents roughly a 50-50 blend of disposition equity from selling wholly-owned assets to fund development and unsecured debt is what you see there. So we do have disposition activity related to funding development.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay perfect. And then one more if you could indulge me. The joint venture, could you just talk about the fee structure associated with that? Just trying to get a sense of if we should be building any meaningful fee income into our numbers for 2019?","Kevin O'Shea","There are fees, primarily it's property management fee. There are some other minor fees around kind of deploying renovation capital. But I mean, the way to think about it is there's a kind of a margin rate property management fee that will be added in.","Tayo Okusanya","I guess the guidance was that how do we kind of think about, how much you could be forecasting that?","Kevin O'Shea","I'm sorry in terms of -- what was the question again.","Tayo Okusanya","In terms of 2019 or how -- just kind of think about quantifying just how much fee income could be coming from that?","Kevin O'Shea","So essentially we sold 80% of $760 million or $610 million which will generate a certain amount of revenue and against which we'll generate property management fee of call it 3%. So that's one way to think about the incremental fees associated with the New York City joint venture. It's a moderate amount of fees, but it's not akin to the asset management platform that we had -- where we had a full suite of fees that were property management, asset management and so forth. But it does provide good economics for the activity we expect to do for this venture.","Q \u2013 Tayo Okusanya","Okay, thanks. That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll hear from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors.","Q \u2013 John Pawlowski","Thanks. Kevin just two quick ones for you. Your comments that lenders are becoming more cautious on the sector, could you provide more details because everything we heard at the NMHC meeting was that lenders love multifamily.","A \u2013 Kevin O'Shea","I think on a relative basis, you're right. I think probably both comments are probably true. It's just -- I think there's increased caution in the later stages of the cycle that you want to make sure with respect to non-recourse financing that you're not over levered, that there's appropriate equity support, that there's not a lot of flexibility on terms. I do think there's -- while there is cautiousness around structuring to your point, there is relatively higher interest by construction lenders in multifamily. And pricing is relatively competitive from what we hear. We're not in the market as you\u2019re well aware because we don't fund our construction from the construction market provided on our line. What we understand is, pricing for construction financings on non-recourse basis is 55% to 60% LTC is kind of more on the L plus mid-200 basis points range.","A \u2013 Tim Naughton","And John just to be specific, this is Tim. Just refer to slide 23, we provide the one chart to the right which speaks to senior loan officer sentiment.","A \u2013 Kevin O'Shea","So there's interest, but I think that lenders are just being a lot more judicious which is probably a good sign for the markets overall the discipline.","Q \u2013 John Pawlowski","Okay. On the expense guidance, can you provide the property tax and payroll growth assumptions that are baked into 2019 guidance?","A \u2013 Tim Naughton","Sean, do you want to handle that?","A \u2013 Sean Breslin","Yes absolutely. John, property tax growth we're expecting is about 3% and then payroll is 2.4%. Just to give you some perspective about 60% of the total OpEx growth we expect for 2019 is coming from property taxes and insurance, control blocks base growth is really projected at 2% for payroll utilities, R&M and everything else.","Q \u2013 John Pawlowski","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Tim for any additional or closing comments.","Tim Naughton","Thanks April, and thanks everyone for being on today. And we look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months over the course of the spring. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would like to now introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jason Reilley, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley","Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There's a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release, as well as the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.","As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during your review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Tim Naughton, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton","Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our third quarter call. Joining me today are Sean Breslin, EVP of Investments and Asset Management; and Tom Sargeant, our Chief Financial Officer. Sean and I have some prepared remarks, and then the 3 of us will be available for questions.","I'll start by summarizing our results for the quarter and then discuss our recent development and financing activities. Sean will provide color on operating performance and current trends in our portfolio and discuss recent investment at redevelopment activity.","To begin, last night, we reported EPS of $0.89 and FFO per share of $1.44, a 23% increase over the third quarter of 2011. This past quarter marks the fifth consecutive quarter of 17%-plus FFO per share growth, driven by a strong performance in our operating portfolio, as well as new communities coming online through redevelopment. FFO per share exceeded the midpoint of guidance provided in July by $0.04, which was a result of a promoted equity interest in connection with the buyout of our joint venture partner at Avalon Del Rey. In Vision, revenues outperformed expectations during the quarter by about $0.01 per share, but was offset by higher interest expense from our September bond offering, which occurred about 2 months earlier than planned.","Overall, the year continues to track more or less as expected, and we've upped our full year FFO per share outlook modestly to account for some of these nonrecurring items. Portfolio performance continues to be strong, as same-store rental revenues increased 5.6% in the third quarter and are up 6% year-to-date. Occupancy for the quarter was 96.3%, positioning us well as we move into the slower winter leasing season. And while there's been pressure on real estate taxes and insurance, we've been able to mitigate expense growth in a number of other areas such that year-to-date expenses are up only about 1.5%.","Despite slower-than-expected job growth and the uncertain political and economic environment, we continue to see healthy demand across the portfolio. The third quarter marks Northern California's fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit NOI growth. Seattle, New York and Boston are all benefiting from hiring within the tech sector. Meanwhile, Southern California is now seeing year-over-year employment gains in the 2%-plus range. On the supply side, completions are up year-over-year, but in the aggregate, 2012 deliveries within our footprint remain in line with the long-term average of about 0.7% of existing stock. As we noted, the mid-Atlantic and downtown Seattle are experiencing the most new supply this year. So far, in the mid-Atlantic, these deliveries have impacted a limited number of communities. And at Seattle, job growth is driving healthy demand for apartments, thereby absorbing new supply.","Looking ahead, if forecasts for job growth in 2013 and '14 materialize in the range of 2 million to 3 million as expected, the resulting demand should continue to support healthy rental market conditions in most of our major markets. Demographics remain favorable, as population growth in the prime renting 25- to 34-year-old cohort is running close to 800,000 annually. In addition, this cohort is even less likely to purchase a home today than they have been in the past, as their home ownership rate has declined 500 basis points since 2002 to around 42%. And while 2013 completions are expected to rise towards 15-year averages nationally, this level of new supply is significantly below levels absorbed the last time demographics were as favorable.","Moving onto development activity. During the quarter, we started 4 new communities, 2 in the East Coast and 2 on the West Coast, totaling $260 million. We also completed 2 communities totaling $100 million this past quarter. Total development underway stands at $1.8 billion, which amounts to roughly 11% of total market capitalization. The projected stabilized yield for the development portfolio is almost 7%. And for those communities in lease up, rents are generally at or above pro forma, and yields are exceeding expectations by about 30 to 40 basis points. In addition, execution remains excellent, as total development costs remain at or below original budget and standing inventory contained, as absorption keeps pace with new deliveries.","Despite a more competitive land market, we've been able to replenish the pipeline over the course of the year. This past quarter, we added 2 development rights at a projected cost of about $145 million, and year-to-date, we've added a total of $730 million in new development rights, with another $450 million in due diligence. The initial projected yields for our Development Rights pipeline of over $2.5 billion, average 6.5% to 7%, are roughly consistent with those communities currently under construction. Land inventory remains modest at just over $300 million.","Lastly, I want to turn to financing activity, where we were very active this past quarter. In July, we completed our second continuous equity program, and initiated a third CEP in August with capacity of $750 million. For the quarter, we issued around 1 million shares, raising just under $150 million at an average stock price of $142 per share. For the year, we've raised $300 million of equity through the CEP at an average price of $141. In September, we completed a 10-year, $450 million unsecured offering at a coupon of 2.95%. The effective rate is 4.3% after accounting for the impact of fees and hedges. The sub-3% coupon established the record for the lowest 10-year unsecured offering by a REIT, and stands as the sixth lowest BBB-tenured coupon executed by any issuer in any sector. Including this issuance, average years to maturity for all fixed-rate debt increased to 5.9.","This $600 million of financing activity during the quarter underscores the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to raise multiple forms of capital at very attractive pricing. In addition, we have ample liquidity to continue to fund our development business well into 2013, with $700 million in cash and nothing drawn on our $750 million line of credit.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sean for his remarks. Sean?","Sean J. Breslin","Thanks, Tim. As Tim mentioned, I will comment on portfolio performance during the quarter, current trends and our investment in redevelopment activity.","Starting first with portfolio performance. Same-store NOI increased 7.1% year-over-year. Revenues increased 5.6%, consisting of a 5.1% increase in rate and a 50-basis-point increase in occupancy. Sequentially, revenues increased 2.4%, driven by a 1.9% increase in rate and a 50-basis-point increase in occupancy. Northern California and Seattle continues to outperform, posting year-over-year rental revenue growth of 10.5% and 10%, respectively. On a sequential basis, each region generated greater than 3% revenue gains. It's worth highlighting that year-over-year rental revenue growth in Seattle has now been north of 8% for 4 consecutive quarters, NOI was up nearly 20% year-over-year in Q3 and momentum remains healthy.","Both Northern California and Seattle continue to benefit from job growth that remains well above the national average. In Northern California, the tech sector is driving employment gains, generating high-quality jobs that support increased rent levels. New supply has not been a material issue in Northern California this year, but we are expecting more deliveries in San Jose as we move into 2013. In Seattle, the economy is also performing well, benefiting from growth in not only the tech sector, but also from retail trade, which is being driven partly by Amazon's expansion and aircraft manufacturing at Boeing. New supply will come online next year in Seattle, but is highly concentrated in the downtown or near downtown submarkets, where we have very little presence.","Metro New York, New Jersey, New England and Southern California all posted year-over-year revenue gains in the 4% to 5% range, with sequential growth of 2% to 2.5%. In the New York Metro area, tech hiring is having a meaningful impact on apartment absorption, both in downtown and in Northern New Jersey. Steady demand, coupled with modest new supply, is supporting occupancy rates close to 97%, and has provided a boost to pricing power.  Boston is also benefiting from job creation along the 128 corridor, where TripAdvisor, Google and others are adding jobs, and although with new supplies on horizon, particularly in the urban core, it is not impacting current fundamentals in the market.","In Southern California, as job growth has accelerated, as Tim mentioned earlier, and is now running at an annualized rate of greater than 2%. San Diego, which lagged the region in job growth earlier this year, is now producing jobs at an annualized rate of about 2.5%, third strongest of any market in our footprint over the past 6 months. While some of the job gains are military-related, the market is also benefiting from robust job growth in the leisure, hospitality and warehouse distribution sectors. As job growth ramps up, the Southern California region will continue to benefit from very low levels of supply. In fact, the Southern California markets are projected to have the lowest level of supply of any of our markets over the next couple of years.","Moving lastly to the mid-Atlantic. The region produced year-over-year revenue growth of 3.8%, 1.8% sequentially. It's no secret that reduced stimulus and fiscal uncertainties continue to limit job creation in the region as new supply comes online, impacting our ability to push rents.  As indicated in our earnings release, turnover was 65% during the quarter, down 200 basis points from Q3 2011.","Move outs due to home purchases increased about 20 basis points from Q2 to roughly 15%, and remained well below the long-term average of 20%. Move outs related to rent increase declined by about 200 basis points sequentially to 17%. As you might expect, we continue to see the highest move out percentage due to rent increase in Northern California and Seattle, which is in the low 20% range, but we're clearly backfilling with new prospects able to pay higher market rents, and these new residents don't appear to be stretched financially since their average rent to income ratio remains consistent with historical levels in our portfolio at 20%.","Shifting to operating expenses. Year-over-year expenses were up 2.6% during the quarter. As we have mentioned in the past, operating expenses can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter based on a number of factors, so judging  operating expense growth on a year-to-date basis tends to give you a better picture of where we are headed. Year-to-date expenses have increased 1.4%, with property taxes putting the most pressure on overall expense growth. The most significant tax increases are occurring in the mid-Atlantic, New York, New Jersey and Pacific Northwest markets, which are seeing 8% to 10% bumps this year for both increased rate and assessments. We benefited from 2 successful tax appeals in Southern California, which contributed to the favorable year-to-date expense variance in the region.","Overall, rent change averaged about 4% during the third quarter, roughly 5% on renewals and 3% on new move ins, while we increased occupancy each month of the quarter from 95.9% in July to 96.6% in September and reduced availability. The portfolio is well positioned right now, with economic occupancy trending in the mid-96% range or 400 basis points above where we were at this time last year. Additionally, availability is about 5%, roughly 50 basis points below last October. October's committed renewals are in the high-4s. And given our healthy occupancy and low availability, November and December renewal offers went out in the low- to mid-6% range, which is similar to the offers we made in Q4 2011.","Shifting to investment activity. We completed the purchase of our partner's 70% interest in Avalon Del Rey during the quarter. We developed a community in 2006 for approximately $70 million and, as a result of the transaction, we gained control of an attractive asset on the Westside of L.A. while unlocking the value of our $4.1 million promoted interest. Looking forward, we have several assets in our acquisition and disposition pipeline. On the disposition front, we currently have about $375 million of assets under contract, the majority of which are owned by Fund I. We filed a pending Fund I disposition settle in Q4. We would have 10 assets remaining or about half the Fund's value to sell in the next couple of years. From an acquisition point of view, we have about $100 million under contract and in due diligence. Assuming the properties clear diligence, they would close in Q4.","In terms of the transaction market, year-to-date trading volume is down about 15% in our markets, and the markets with increased volume like Seattle have not been targets for us. As a result of the reduced volume and healthy pricing, acquisition volume remains below our original plan for the year. Currently, we expect transaction activity to total approximately $950 million for the calendar year, which includes roughly $300 million in acquisitions, 80% of which is for the parent entity, and $650 million in dispositions, about 40% of which is for the parent entity and 60% is for Fund I.","Moving finally to redevelopment activity. We completed 5 redevelopments during the third quarter for an incremental total capital investment of about $32 million. These 5 projects were all completed via our occupied turn program and outperformed our performer end projections by about 5% or $100 per home, resulting in a weighted average return on enhancements of roughly 20% as compared to our original expectations of 12%. Execution has been strong, as each project was completed on schedule and either in line or below our original capital budget.","Now I'll turn the call back to Tim for a few comments.","Timothy J. Naughton","Thanks, Sean. So in summary, 2012 continues to track largely as planned. Attractive fundamentals continue to support strong performance. The portfolio is well-positioned headed into the seasonally slower fourth quarter, and we continue to deploy cost-effective capital into attractive development and redevelopment opportunity.","Now with that, operator, we are ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe from Citi Financial Group.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I know you're probably not ready to give guidance for 2013 quite yet, but obviously, with one of your peers giving guidance, someone's probably going to ask about it. So I'm just wondering if there's anything you can say anecdotally about how 2013 should stack up relative to this year, and whether some of the -- I know the commentary you heard on the call earlier today in terms of 4% to kind of 5.5% rent growth sounds like a reasonable number.","Timothy J. Naughton","Eric, Tim here. Yes, I am aware that one of our peers did, I think,  give preliminary outlook as related to same-store revenue growth. And obviously, we had not done that and don't intend to do so until January. But maybe provide a little bit of color in terms of how we're generally looking at the market and how 2013 might shape up. And I would say, generally, from a fundamental standpoint, we expect demand and supply to be roughly in balance with the job growth and new supply being at added about a rate of about 1.5%. Obviously, that's an elevated level for supply, but -- relative to what we see in the past, but at a time where we see job growth increasing to around 2 million nationally, about 1.5% across our markets. Sean mentioned, obviously, we have a very high occupancy platform, which I think is important consideration, in the mid-96% range. And from my perspective, in terms of how 2013 will play out, I think it's somewhat a question about how -- what happens with homeownership rates and, frankly, the marginal propensity of rent for those incremental households that are created over the next year. I think the consensus is that homeownership rates will continue to trickle down a bit. I think that will be good for the sector. And then I think the second issue is really this notion of pent-up demand, and whether any of that is really released into the market, which would shift that balance of demand and supply in favor of more demand. A number of third parties have estimated there's around 2 million households that are out there that are pent-up and that are likely to get released over the course of the cycle, and we haven't seen it yet. But to the extent you start seeing that in 2013 and '14, I think that can bode well for the outlook for 2013.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's very helpful. And I guess one of the points you brought up there in terms of thinking about how changes in home ownership is going to affect the apartment business next year and moving forward, it seems like most of your peers don't really see much of a risk from people moving out from your apartments into single-family homes. I mean, would you say that you share that opinion, that you don't see in the near-term or medium-term that as a risk?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, I think housing has bottomed, is my view, and I think -- Sean mentioned that we've seen a marginal increase in the order of 20 basis points of people moving out to purchase homes. But still, around 500 basis points lower than long-term average. I suspect that we'll see that drift up over time as consumer confidence takes hold. This is all assuming an economy that stays on a moderate, slightly better than 2012 growth trajectory, but I suspect -- you've seeing savings rates improve. They're not getting much return from any alternative investments. And so I think you will see some folks at the margin take those savings and become homebuyers as we move further into the cycle, but I don't know anybody that's really anticipating a strong turnaround in home buying, and then when you sort of couple that with the amount of excess inventory that's been -- that's already been absorbed. And I think just the builders, the reduction in capacity that you've seen in the buildings -- and so I think it's likely to translate more in the form of increased home prices than it is maybe in volume.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then just one last question. You started a couple of developments in New Jersey this quarter. Looking at your New York sort of Northeast portfolio, you have a decent amount outside of the 5 boroughs, so just curious whether you could talk about your strategy around allocating capital between the more immediate New York City area versus going outside of the 5 boroughs, investing in Connecticut and New Jersey, Long Island City and places like that.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, Eric, I would tell you, we've always been relatively agnostic between urban and suburban investment. I think I talked about this last quarter. I mean, clearly, over the last 10 years, urban has outperformed suburban. On the other hand, that hasn't gone unnoticed by the market, and it's being reflected, certainly, in asset pricing and in land pricing and so -- and our view is more of a mixed strategy, is probably hedging our bets -- hedging your bets is probably the right approach to our markets. And particularly, when you look in the New York area, when you look at places like Connecticut and Westchester and New Jersey and Long Island, we're seeing opportunities there that we have never seen, really, in our history in terms of -- that would have gone condominium. We can build wood frame, relatively close and very high-end bedroom communities that really have outstanding economics, 7%-plus-type yields. New York, the -- Manhattan certainly doesn't give you those kinds of initial economics, but perhaps gives you a little bit stronger growth over the long run. But we think sort of a mixed strategy with respect to urban and suburban across all markets probably makes the most sense, New York included.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gaurav Mehta from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","A couple of quick questions on your development pipeline. When you think about your development pipeline over the long run, what's the optimal development size strategy you're in for?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, this is Tim. I wouldn't say that there's an optimal size. As I mentioned, it's currently running about 11% of market capitalization. I think it's gotten as high as 20% in the past, probably as low as the mid-single digits. Those are probably the relevant guardrails when we talk about size from a balance sheet capacity. There's also issue of organization capacity. We think, right now, the organization is geared to do about 1 billion or so a year in new starts, which supports about a 2 billion -- 2.2 billion, 2.3 billion-sized pipeline. So we would need to increase organization capacity to get much beyond that kind of level of overall production, and then you just overlay that based upon the opportunity set in the marketplace and the kind of share that makes sense in order to pursue what we think are the most attractive investments. So it seems -- during the expansion period, it seems to be kind of in that 1 billion, 1.1 billion, 1.2 billion range. And over the longer term, when you look through down cycles, it's probably a little bit less than that.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","That's helpful. And a follow-up question on that development. How are the construction costs trending over the last couple of quarters, and what do you expect in 2013?","Timothy J. Naughton","2013 is a tough one to project, in part because -- part of what we've been seeing has been a removal of production capacity from the construction industry over the last few years. But what we've seen over the last year, on wood frame, we're seeing wood frame up in the 4% to 6% range, on average, across the board. High-rise, a little bit more than that. Concrete construction, a little bit more than that, around 6% to 8%. And a lot of that pressure has been coming from certain commodities like lumber and composite materials, were up around 25% over year-over-year. Drywall and insulation in the 10% to 20%, and then labor, just generally across the board, as contractors are restoring profit, they were doing -- back in 2010 and early '11, they were doing business basically to cover overhead, and they're back to restoring this profit margin to 5% to 10%. So that's really what's driven the price increases over the last year or so, and we're probably somewhere in between, where trough pricing was in the prior peak pricing. As it relates to 2013, we're still feeling some pressure. Supply is, as I mentioned, is likely to grow nationally next year. Started to flatten, I think, in our markets. And then it's just a question of have you -- production capacity comes online relative to when the other sectors start gearing up. So at this point, we expect there to be pressure, probably something in the order of what we've seen over the last 12 months as we look forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg from Zelman.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Could you talk about your operating strategy over the course of the third quarter? It was interesting, seems as though you might have positioned more defensively than usual, looking at occupancy rise 50 basis points sequentially, nearly the opposite of what happened the last year. And then your new move in and renewal gains of 3% and 5% compared to 6% and 7% last year.","Sean J. Breslin","Sure, Dave, this is Sean. The trend, obviously, was a push for occupancy during the quarter. So we probably pushed occupancy at maybe a little bit beyond where we want it to be, but maybe only 20, 30 basis points. So as you work through it, that's sort of real-time pricing each week. So we make adjustments through our revenue management system to reduce availability and push occupancy, and certainly, there's a lot of science behind it. There's a little bit of art as well, and so we may have given up a little bit on rate to push occupancy up. We wanted to end the quarter in a strong position, and I think we did. So then, if you look forward into the fourth quarter, the renewal offers that we've sent out reflect that being in the 6% to 6.5% range as we look forward into November and December. So I think we'll gain some of that back. But clearly, there was a bias to push occupancy in the third quarter, which is not inconsistent with what we've done in the past, maybe some slightly different results based on how hard we were pushing or not pushing from year-to-year. But typically, there is a bias in the third quarter to make sure that we end the quarter on a strong note from an occupancy and availability point of view.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","That's helpful. And Tim, going back to your opening comments, can you talk about your view as to what's driving the lower transaction volume in your markets and what do you need to see to get you more active on the purchase front?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, maybe I could start, and ask Sean and see if he's got any thoughts on that as well. I think, as we came out of this last -- correction, Dave, I think there's just -- our markets were in demand, and as people were looking for liquidity, we're looking for the safe tray. It makes sense to give the market what it was demanding, which was coastal -- core coastal market product, and so we saw a disproportionate amount of, I think, our footprint get released into the market. I think as fundamentals continue to be more widespread, other markets were starting to show improvement. People are starting to get -- either get a little worried at pricing in some of our markets or just wanted to look at a broader set of opportunities. That just opened the market for some secondary and some of the tertiary markets from a transaction standpoint. But Sean, anything to add to that?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes. I think what Tim said is absolutely right. Typically, what you see is, as things open back up, people are looking to buy core product at a discount to replacement cost in the coastal markets. So that's kind of the first wave. Second wave tends to be people looking at value-add product in the coastal markets. And then as that pricing becomes much more competitive and people do start looking at secondary or tertiary submarkets within our markets and\/or some of the commodity markets, where the yields tend to be a little bit higher in terms of trading cap rates. So I think that's what we're seeing play out over the last couple of years here.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","And I think, last quarter, you mentioned that you weren't very actively looking in D.C., and I think you just mentioned earlier you're not looking actively in Seattle. Could you talk about -- in what markets are you looking and maybe just anecdotally give us an idea of how far off you are on the bids that you're submitting versus where the assets are trading?","Sean J. Breslin","Sure. First, as it relates to the 2 markets you mentioned specifically, we've not been active in buying assets in D.C. over the last 12 to 18 months. We have been somewhat active in selling assets in D.C. We sold a couple of large assets last year, as an example, in submarkets where we felt like the supply was going to be such that the -- it made sense to trade out of those assets and get better returns elsewhere. I would say -- I wouldn't be surprised to say that we'd be looking at assets in D.C. over the next 12 to 18 months, as the supply comes online and it impacts NOIs, impacts peoples underwriting of rents and, therefore, cap rates get the same returns. So I wouldn't be surprised to see us do that as those opportunities become available. As it relates to Seattle, we feel pretty good in terms of our allocation to Seattle right now with the existing portfolio plus the development activity that we have underway there. So we're not necessarily looking to grow in Seattle. And to the extent that we were, we probably would be buying in Seattle at a different part in the cycle. It tends to be a little more volatile in terms of the pricing in that market, reflecting sort of the -- just the underlying base there, being primarily tech and other industries that tend to be more cyclical. In terms of where we've been looking, we've been looking somewhat in the Northeast in submarkets that we feel are pretty supply protected, and we're getting yields that makes sense to us. And we've also been looking, I'd say, in Southern California, where you still have a couple of places like L.A. and Orange County where we're still not back to peak rent levels that were achieved back in '08. So either for the Fund or for AvalonBay, you've seen us buy some stuff there over the last 18 months. And in terms of spreads, it really depends. I mean, we're not bidding on assets in Seattle, so it would be hard to tell you what those spreads are. We kind of monitor pricing. Pricing overall, I'd say, for higher-end product in Seattle is in the low-4s, maybe even in the high-3s for core urban product. We're not chasing that. So I can't really tell you what the spread would be. But generally, on the West Coast, cap rates are sort of in the 4 to 5 range, maybe a little bit below 4 for core stuff that's infill. And as you come to the East Coast, there's probably in the 4.5 to 5.5 range, except for New York, which, depending on how you value the abatement, can be in the 3s to low 4s. So that's kind of a range of where pricing is and hopefully that's helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just going to the promoted income, you guys -- I recall, the Christie Place, there's a promote that you guys have occasionally earned out of that. So sort of a 2-part on the promote. One is, is there anything that we should anticipate out of the sale of Fund I? And two, how much visibility do you have it in the sense of is this something that you can let us know that, hey, this year or in coming quarter, if we sell this, we could recognize a promote anywhere of x to y, just so that we can sort of think about the value because, clearly, it's value that you guys are creating, and it's nice to sort of think about it in advance rather than just reading about in the press release sort of after.","Thomas J. Sargeant","Yes, Alex, so this is Tom. One point on the Christie Place. We continuously receive a promoted interest almost immediately because of the structure of that transaction in a low-floater bond. So we continuously recognize joint venture income on a promoted basis for that asset. When it comes to predicting or projecting promoted interest, that is so sensitive to, really, the end of the life of the funds because of the way this is structured. It would be very hard for us to give you much guidance very far out. Fund I, because of the timing of those buys and right before the downturn, the opportunity to promote there is less than for Fund II. Fund II would have a lifespan that's so far out that it's probably not even meaningful to talk about today. We do have a few cats and dogs out there in terms of other opportunities for promotes. We don't have that many joint ventures, but there could be another promote coming down the road in the next 3 to 6 months, but it's hard to predict that at this point. I think we'll just wait for guidance to come out in January before we let you know anything about that.","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, just another thing to add to that, Alex. I'd just say in a joint venture is where we don't have discretion or just -- they just tend to be episodic because it's hard to be a function of our -- what our partners' objectives are, so -- and that sometimes just happens during the course of the year like it did here in Del Rey, where we had an opportunity to have the conversation. And there've been other times where we've actually triggered a buy-sell to unlock promote, but that's usually a pretty -- it's usually the result of a pretty dynamic discussion that's going on with your partner before you get to that point.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. Yes, no, it's good. I mean, clearly, it's value that you guys create. Second question is, with all the talk of the new normal and consumers making do with earning less and consumer confidence rising, as people just get comfortable with the new normal, clearly, your tech tenants and others are willing to pay the rents needed. But just sort of curious how this is manifested as far as apartment design. Some folks are talking about scaling down kitchens. I don't know if you can go to kitchenettes. But sort of curious, as you guys continue to develop the AVA brand and build new product, if all the changes that are going on mean that you can actually design smaller units, maybe units that have less infrastructure because people are eating out more or doing more socializing.","Timothy J. Naughton","Alex, this is Tim. Speak maybe specifically to AVA, they are -- AVA, by its design, is intended -- are intended to be smaller plans on the order of 150 to 250 square feet per like unit and, say, an Avalon community. So average, one bedroom may be 600 square feet or less, and then an Avalon community, maybe, call it 725, 750 square feet. In addition, really, a pure, pure AVA play like the one that we're building in H Street here in D.C. It tend to be a smaller community, not highly amenitized. So to your point, the amenity, in many ways, is the neighborhood, and so you could save a bit just in terms of some of the infrastructure cost. Then as you get back to the units, they tend to be more -- at least, on new construction, we're looking at more kind of open almost wall-style design that does allow you to minimize -- tighten certain spaces like kitchens, or maybe combine even kind of bedroom and living areas that allow you to squeeze some square footage out of some of those spaces. So that's probably more focused on the urban side. But we are seeing some of that translate into even some of our suburban opportunities, where we are introducing some of these smaller floor plans, and to even some of the wood-frame suburban deals that we're building.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Does the greater density translate to higher yields, or it mainly just offsets the increased land costs and other costs?","Timothy J. Naughton","I wouldn't say it translates into higher yields. What we're trying to do is position it to what we think -- where we think demand is within a particular submarket. So if we think demand is deepest at a price point of, call it, $1,800 to $2,000, we're trying to design a product that can deliver value within that price range. And often times, that means smaller floor plans or communities that don't have quite the same levels of amenities, and you can do that through new construction. You can also do it through redevelopment. In fact, in AVA, about half of the communities we've identified are new construction. About half are redevelopment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just had a quick follow-up to Gaurav's questions, and I know I ask these often. If we look at the metrics in the quarter with rent growth sequentially sort of coming down a little bit and occupancy numbers going up, is there a read through to the RMS system? And is there a takeaway that you guys were a bit more cautious in your rent aggression in the quarter? This is a pattern that we've seen over the past couple of years. Or is it just purely seasonal? What's your thoughts on that dynamic in the quarter?","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, David, this is Sean. In terms of the revenue management system, as I mentioned, there's a lot of science behind it, but there's also some art to it in terms of the different variables that you play with. And I would say that, last year, when we were running through revenue management in the third quarter, we had a bias for occupancy. We probably didn't adjust the variables quite as much as we needed to, to get to the point where we wanted to be. So this year, we're probably -- we're a little more aggressive in doing that. And as I mentioned, I think, in my prior response, maybe a little too much so. Occupancy, as I mentioned, in September was at 96.6%. We would have been happy at 96.2%, 96.3%, as an example. So we probably did give up a little bit in the third quarter. I wouldn't say it was intentionally defensive, though, to your point. So I think we're positioned where we'd like to be in the relevant range, maybe a little bit high, but we weren't being defensive in nature.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. Are you -- maybe I missed this, but are you able to share what you're -- you've been seeing in October and potentially what some of the models are indicating on a go-forward basis on a 30, 60-day...","Sean J. Breslin","Sure, sure. October, the committed renewals that we have in hand are in the high 4s. In terms of November and December, renewal offers went out in the 6% to 6.5% range, which really reflects kind of the strong position we're in today with both occupancy and availability.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask a question about, Tim, your comment that you expect demand and supply to be generally imbalanced in 2013. Can you just talk about which markets, if any, would be on one side or the other of the balance if you have a group of markets that you think demand will exceed supply materially or vice versa?","Timothy J. Naughton","Sure, Karin. Well, I think, certainly, the mid-Atlantic, both D.C. and Baltimore, were markets that, I think, everyone's identified is where demand -- the relationship between demand and supply is likely to be. It will be weaker, without question. In terms of other markets or regions, where you may be below average for our footprint, parts of New England, kind of bedroom communities, if you will, where job growth is expected to be a little less robust, even though we don't necessarily expect to see a whole lot of supply. And then in terms of relative strength, we do expect still some strength, particularly -- in parts of the Bay Area, particularly East Bay, which is getting -- not getting a whole lot of new supply. We do expect Orange County and San Diego actually to start showing some improvement, just given some of the job growth figures we've seen of late that Sean talked about. And then also, New York. Despite the production being up a bit in Manhattan, it's still -- job growth and the job fundamentals there, really, continue to be very, very good, and we expect to have continued relative strength there.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Do you happen to recall when the last time, historically, demand and supply were roughly equal and in balance like that?","Timothy J. Naughton","I think it's typically -- you see it in the middle of the expansion cycle. When, often times, at the beginning of the expansion cycle, demand is outstripping supply, because it just takes a while for supply to gear up. And by the time supply gears up, it's usually 2 or 3 years and you're gelling up in a pattern in terms of job growth that's more indicative of average job growth of, call it, 1.5% to -- anywhere between 1.5% to 2.5%. So I'm not looking at the time. Seriously, it goes back too far, but my guess is, probably, it was the '05 to '07 period where you were kind of in the middle of that '04 to '08 expansion. And then, I think, when you look back into the '90s from '95 to 2000, I think was -- I think you had a pretty good period where, if anything, demand outstripped supply, but kind of within a constant margin, if you will. But I would tell you, I think it's typically at the middle of the expansion period. So [indiscernible] idea for the next couple of years.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. All right. Okay, and just last question. Do you have a sense that, if you got no market rent growth from here, what your 2013 revenue growth might be just based on the current rent roll?","Sean J. Breslin","Karen, this is Sean. As Tim mentioned, we're not providing much of an outlook for '13, but if you're going to kind of what loss-to-lease looks like, I think is sort of where you were headed with that question, given revenue management, that number moves around a lot. You can change it day by day, almost, in terms of pricing market rents. I'd say if you look back over the last maybe 3 or 4 months, as an example, I'd say loss-to-lease is probably in the range of 4% or so, just to give you some perspective for what's sort of baked in, if you want to think about it that way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Martin from Morningstar.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a question regarding when you look at your development pipeline going forward, Southern California, can you characterize or quantify a bit as to what your development potential is in Southern California? What percentage of the land portfolio would be there? Just trying to gauge the potential.","Timothy J. Naughton","Sure, Philip. This is Tim. Hard to quantify. I would say this, though. It's the one region where we've been adding the most resources on the development side over the last 6 to 12 months. We added -- we just added a new officer into that region. For instance, we do have a number of development rights. I don't have it in front of me, but I want to say it's on the order of $350 million or so right now. And just given the expanse of that market from San Diego up through L.A. and beyond into Ventura, I do think it's probably likely to be a little more cyclical, just given the nature of the West Coast markets. But it wouldn't surprise me, where you may have some years where you might start a couple of hundred million and other years where that number's closer to 0. But I do think it's probably a region that we could start a couple of deals, 2 to 3 deals a year with production north of $100 million a year.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And when you look at the new supply coming online in your markets, how truly competitive is it with your product?","Timothy J. Naughton","Well, I -- maybe I'll start and, Sean, maybe you can talk to specific markets, submarkets where we might be more exposed to new supply. I mean, generally, our portfolio, while the average age is 16 years or so, it is mostly still class A. So I would tell you that -- and anything coming new into the market is class A sort of by definition. So I do think most of those, if they were to have a new community pop up next door, it would impact and be competitive at some level. But in terms of actual markets and submarkets where we might be more exposed to new supply, Sean...","Sean J. Breslin","Yes, just a few comments there, Philip. In terms of the regions, where we're watching supply closely, first, obviously, is the mid-Atlantic. And if you look at -- kind of break that down into suburban Maryland, D.C. and Northern Virginia, where you've seen most of the supply come through, and suburban Maryland is going to be in the Rockville, Gaithersburg area and\/or Silver Spring, Wheaton maybe. We don't have a lot of assets, existing assets, up there right now. We sold a large asset there last year. I think we're down to 3 assets in that area. So while something new coming online could be competitive, we just don't have much there. And as you go into D.C., sort of the same thing. We have 2 assets in D.C. So even though there's a fair bit of supply coming online there, wouldn't be all that competitive with us from a broader portfolio perspective since it's pretty small. Northern Virginia, a fair bit of supply coming into the Texas corner market. We do have a couple of assets there. Quite a bit coming into Old Town Alexandria, as an example. We had a very large asset that we sold there last year. It's 500 homes, almost. So we exited that market. And then Loudoun County is expected to have quite a bit come online in '13, and we really don't have any product there. So in terms of Metro D.C., I think the question comes down to would any deliveries be competitive from a product point of view. And I think the answer, generally, as Tim alluded to, would be yes. But in terms of specific submarkets, we think the portfolio is pretty well positioned in D.C. If you go to Seattle, which is another market that everybody talks about, most of the supply is going to be in downtown or immediately adjacent submarkets. We really don't have much there. We have one smaller asset in downtown Seattle in Belltown, and one just outside in Queen Anne, and we had a development in Ballard. Those are really the 3 assets out of our portfolio. A lot of our other product is on the east side or in northern Seattle. So not nearly as much going on there as there is downtown. And then probably the third Metro area, to talk a little bit about maybe San Jose. Most of the product being delivered in San Jose is either central or northeast, with a high percentage being in the northeast quadrant. We had an asset there we sold a couple of years ago, so we don't have a lot of exposure to the northeast. We do have some exposure in central San Jose. We have 2 or 3 assets there. So probably more comfortable being protected in the kind of mid-to-upper Peninsula assets. So this is stuff that's the core of San Jose that we own, again, 3 or 4 assets would be more subject to that new supply. So that's 3 of the metro areas. Hopefully that's helpful in terms of an explanation.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Tim, I believe on your last call, you'd mentioned $700 million of development starts in the second half of the year. That puts you to about $440 million in the fourth quarter. Is that still correct?","Timothy J. Naughton","Mike, 1 or 2 of those might slide into the first quarter of 2013. So a couple of them were slated right at the end of the year, and whether they're officially a Q4 or Q1 start, not really sure. I mean, a lot of it comes down to whether you get -- whether you're able to pull the permit before the holidays. But the deals that we identified at the end of the year, we do anticipate starting imminently, but some of them may slide into early 2013.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Any changes to the capital raising guidance you guys had put out there when you updated in the second quarter?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Mike, this is Tom. No real changes. We may be just a little bit less than what we'd anticipated for the year, which was about $800 million of external capital. We may be closer to $700 million, but -- or $750 million, but I think we're largely on target there.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Tom, while I got you there, can you talk how much of the forward starting swaps are still left as we look ahead to next year? And then also, you guys have had a great success on the expense front, particularly in the bad debt side. Can you give us a little sense of what you're seeing on that? And also, you provided a little bit of detail on '13. Just curious, bigger picture, what you expect kind of on the expense side in '13?","Thomas J. Sargeant","Well, we're not going to talk today about 2013 in terms of expense growth. I think Tim gave some overall market commentary on the revenue side, but we're going to ask you to be patient on 2013. Bad debt was about 75 basis points for the quarter, and it was about the same last year this quarter. So that number continues to stay the same or drift down a little bit. In terms of the hedge -- hedges, just a little background. In April of '11, we put in place 2 hedges that basically provided interest-rate protection for about half of our anticipated debt needs in '12 and '13. And at the time we did those hedges, we locked in at what we thought would be an effective interest rate on the hedges of about 5.4%, 5.5%. So at that time, we said when treasuries were about 3.50%, if we can issue 10-year debt at 5.5%, that works for us and we move forward, and we hedged half of our projected offering. Today, the market's more like 3%. And so on half of the issuance we did in September, we effectively had already locked in a rated 5.5%. And then on the other half, we benefited from rates declining to the 2.95% that Tim mentioned. And that basically blends to the effect of 4.3% that you saw in our September offering. So we cleared that hedge. The second hedge, which was, again, for about half the debt we expected to issue in '13, matures in April of next year. And at that time, it's our expectation that we will clear that hedge. Again, that was done at a rate environment of about 5.5%. Rates have come down. So the good news is we benefit from the decline in rate on half of that. But obviously, issued that hedge at a time where rates were about 5.5%. So it would be my expectation that we would end up in a similar effective interest rate on debt we do next year if we do about the same amount. One thing I'd comment on hedging is that you really need to think about hedging as if you issued the debt at the time that you did the hedge, because you're locking in at the interest rate roughly at that time. The only thing you don't have is you don't have the cash on your balance sheet and the potential drag that, that cash brings with it. So that's one of the benefits of not actually having issued the debt. But if you go back to November of '10, where we issued debt at 3.95% and we were high-fiving and loving life, that debt deal was out of the market today by probably $25 million because we -- our interest rates continued to fall and, in fact, fell another 25% or 100 basis points, as evidenced by our September offering. So think about these hedges as if we issued the debt back in April of '11, so we didn't have the interest carry dragging us on the earnings side during that period.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then final question, just as you guys have been pretty active there marketing some of the Fund I assets and also, I think, you mentioned $100 million on your contract, as you're out there bidding, as you're out there hopefully getting sales and also bidding on properties, are you seeing any changes in underwriting, maybe in the last 90 days, that have been noticeable?","Sean J. Breslin","Let's see. Mike, this is Sean. I wouldn't say anything that's terribly noticeable, no. I mean, as I've mentioned, we might start to look to be a buyer in D.C. over the next 12 to 18 months. I think, certainly, there's some questions about underwriting in D.C. But I wouldn't say there's any kind of overall shift in underwriting from what we're seeing. Pricing is still pretty aggressive. I mentioned the cap rates, both East and West, in some previous Q&A. It's still fairly healthy out there. So I don't see a big shift in underwriting at this point now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew McCulloch from Green Street Advisors.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick ones. On the 4 land parcels you bought, did you already control those via option or are those new deals?","Timothy J. Naughton","Andy, this is Tim. Those were deals that we had controlled. One -- a good piece of it was closing out the Willoughby West option in Brooklyn, which was subject to a number of takedowns over time. But there were a couple of deals in Boston and L.A. which were also option deals, if you were. So they weren't sort of quick-close ready-to-go deals when we first put them on the contract.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And as you're looking at more land parcels, is it more raw land you're looking at now as opposed to entitled stuff?","Timothy J. Naughton","Yes, it's -- I can give you a little bit of color on that. It's almost entirely raw land that requires entitlement. So I mean, year-to-date, I think I've mentioned we've got -- we've put $730 million into the Development Right pipeline, have another -- actually another $470 million in the due diligence. So that represents a total of 17 deals. I think the $730 million represents 8 deals, and all those need entitlement work at some level. Some have quasi approvals. Others just need to go through the approval process from scratch, and the 9 deals that are in due diligence, almost all -- first of all, most of them are suburban deals, if not all of them suburban deals. And the majority of those are entitled and need significant entitlement work. So yes, most of those are option deals that -- they require anywhere between 18 to 36 months of entitlement.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one more question on development. The rents you show on your development schedule that haven't begun leasing, that represents rent at the time the project started, right?","Timothy J. Naughton","Correct.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","I don't know if you can share this, but what would the average that 6.8% yield you show on the current pipeline go to if you marked all those rents, current rents, today?","Timothy J. Naughton","We honestly don't look at it that way. I suppose we could just look at the market -- the average market change for each of those deals, but we haven't done that. My guess is a lot of these did start in the last year. So my guess is its 2% to 3%, maybe, higher in terms of the average rent on the deals that haven't been marked up yet. And as I mentioned before, the deals that are in lease-up, they're outperforming by about 35 basis points or so. That number moves around based upon concessions and things like that. But collectively, the basket, they're outperformed by about 35 basis points or about 5%, if you will, on the yield, which probably translates into 3% or 4% higher rents than what we'd originally underwrote.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Paula Poskon from Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","My questions have been answered.","Operator","That concludes today's questions.

Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.","Jason Reilley - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thank you. Aaron, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities' third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion.","There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.","As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion.","The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q3 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin, and Matt Birenbaum each of us will provide some comments on the slides that we've posted last night and then we'll all be available for Q&A afterwards.","I'll start with a brief overview of Q3 results and then Sean will provide an update on operations and how the portfolio is positioned headed into Q4. Matt will talk about development activity and how we are positioned to deliver growth through that platform over next two years to three years, and Kevin will discuss the close out of Fund II and provide some insight into the balance sheet at this point in the cycle. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some thoughts about our recent announcement to enter the Denver market and our intention to enter Southeast Florida in the future.","Just starting now on slide 4. Results for the quarter included a core FFO per share growth of 5.8%. Same-store revenue growth was at 2.2% or 2.3%, including redevelopment; year-to-date same-store revenue growth stands at 2.6% or 2.8%, including redevelopment. And then lastly, same-store sequential growth came in at 1.3% for the quarter and 1.4% once you include redevelopment.","We completed another $95 million in new development in Q3, bringing total completed year-to-date to $1.15 billion. We expect to complete another $650 million or so in Q4, which will result in about $1.8 billion, completed for the full year.","Year-to-date and full-year completions are expected to stabilize, at an initial yield in low 6% range, well above prevailing cap rates for this basket of assets. In his comments, Matt will describe in more detail how these completions along with development underway will drive earnings and NAV growth over the next couple years.","I'll now turn it over to Sean, who'll discuss portfolio operating results.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Tim. Turning to slide 5, our same-store portfolio continues to produce rent change that's generally consistent with supply and demand being essentially in equilibrium. We've been trending in the 2% to 2.5% range all year long, with renewals consistently in the low 4%s and new move-ins following a more seasonal pattern. For Q3 renewals averaged 4.1%, while new move-ins were 90basis points.","In terms of the regions, Seattle continued to lead the way with rent change north of 5% for the third quarter, followed by Southern California in the low 4% range. Boston produced rent change in the low 3%s, while Northern California, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Greater New York, New Jersey regions, all deliver change in the 1.5% to 2% range.","Moving to slide 6, the same-store portfolio is very well-positioned for the seasonally slower fourth quarter. Our same-store average physical occupancy rate for October is about 20 basis points above last year and availability is trending roughly 30 basis points lower.","For the development portfolio, we met our revenue and NOI expectations for the third quarter. In addition our deliveries during the third quarter were consistent with our mid-year update that we're comfortable with the expected pace of both deliveries and absorption for the fourth quarter.","And, with that, I'll turn it over to Matt to talk about development in more detail.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Sean. Turning to development, our development underway should provide good future growth to both earnings and NAV as those communities are completed and finish their lease ups. Slide 7 shows the $225 million in NOI, that we're expecting to realize from our current development with nearly half of that NOI to come from communities that have not yet even started any leasing activity. Only $17 million worth of NOI was generated by these properties in the current quarter. So, there's clearly a lot of additional NOI to come.","On slide 8, we translate this future NOI into core FFO. We have raised most, but not all of the capital required to fund this $3.8 billion book of business. Because the earnings accretion depends on what the ultimate cost of that capital turns out to be we've shown a range of earnings impacts here based on weighted average initial cost of capital between 3.5% and 4%, which in turn translates into $0.53 to $0.67 of incremental core FFO upon stabilization.","Slide 9 shows the spot value creation from this development translated into NAV per share accretion. The current weighted average initial yield on this basket of properties is 5.9% and we believe if these assets were completed and available for sale in today's market they would sell for a weighted average cap rate of roughly 4.4%. This translates into $1.3 billion of value creation on completion or $9.42 per share.","Turning to slide 10, we have a very long track record of delivering strong risk-adjusted returns from our development activity through all stages of multiple market cycles. As Tim mentioned, we expect to deliver a company record of $1.8 billion in development completions in 2017 at profit margins of close to 30%, consistent with the margins we've achieved throughout this cycle.","The chart on the left shows our development yields by year of completion going all the way back to the late 1990s and compares those yields to cap rates in that same year. With the exception of the single year of 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis, we have delivered positive spot value creation on completion every year for 20 years running. And because we're long term investors and not merchant builders, even those deals completed in the worst-case scenario year of 2009 are today yielding 7% on cost, allowing for plenty of long-term value creation from that book of business as well.","The long-term returns can be seen in the chart on the right where we have sorted our unlevered development IRRs by the point in various cycles at which they were completed. While the deals which were completed earlier in the cycle have delivered stronger long-term returns, the returns across all time periods have been well in excess of our cost of capital and have delivered strong NAV creation for our shareholders.","Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin to discuss Fund II performance and the balance sheet.","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thanks, Matt. Matt just touched on the primary way in which we allocate capital to new investments, which is through development; another way we do so is through acquisitions. In this cycle, one vehicle we've employed to create value through acquisition is our second value added fund through which we commenced investment activity in 2009, and sold our last community this past quarter. In addition to receiving asset management and property management fees, AvalonBay as general partner, received attractive investment returns, as well as, a promoted return of $35 million above our participant share of the fund's investment returns for performance achieved in excess of certain thresholds.","As you can see on the bottom Slide 11, AvalonBay's investment returns on Fund II were strong. Excluding fee income, AvalonBay achieved a gross levered cash flow multiple on its invested equity of 2.4 times and a gross levered internal rate of return of 19.2%.","Turning briefly to the balance sheet on Slide 12, we thought it might be helpful to highlight the evolution of a few balance sheet metrics across this cycle. Specifically, we show how four items, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, our unencumbered NOI percentage, composition of our debt, and our credit rating have evolved over three periods 4Q 2009 during the last downturn, 4Q 2013 not long after we completed the Archstone acquisition and then today. As you can see our credit profile and financial flexibility have significantly improved over the cycle and are arguably as strong as they have ever been in the company's history, which bodes well for capacity to provide continued strength, stability and growth throughout the cycle.","And now, I'll turn it back to Tim to discuss our market expansion into Denver and Southeast Florida.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin, and we're now on slide 13. As you know, we previous \u2013 previously announced our entry into the Denver market with a recent acquisition. In addition, today we're announcing our intention to expand into Southeast Florida as well. We've talked with a number of you over the years about our geographic footprint and some of the key factors that inform our thoughts with respect to market selection and portfolio allocation. We thought it'd be helpful to provide a little more color behind our decision to expand into these two markets.","First, I guess I'd like to preface my comments by saying that while we are generally viewed as having had a stable strategy over the years, it's not been a static one. In fact, over time, our strategy has evolved to expand into high rise and mixed-use product, which allowed us to enter many urban, TOD and infill suburban submarkets. And through our brands, we now target multiple customer segments, including a value oriented customer through the Eaves brand, and a younger social seeking demographic through AVA. And we have entered and exited markets over the years, entering markets like Seattle and Baltimore, while exiting markets like Chicago and Minneapolis.","So, our decision to enter Denver and Southeast Florida just does not reflect a shift in strategy, but rather an evolution and implementation of our strategy. And when it comes to market selection, some of the key attributes that we look for and demonstrate on this slide include markets with, first and foremost, the higher percentage of knowledge based employment, over-indexing in stem finance, education, and healthcare related jobs. Increasingly we believe that there will be winning and losing MSAs as economy migrates to more of a knowledge-based economy.","A second and related factor is that we favor markets that appeal to our target customer profile, as we prefer markets that again over-index to the younger, college educated and higher income boomer segments. Third, we prefer markets characterized by lower housing affordability, which helps support demand for rental housing, and higher rental propensities. Fourth, we prefer markets where the public sector is active and invest in infrastructure and cultural amenities, both important factors to support growth and quality of life within the market.","And lastly, importantly, we like markets that we believe play to our competitive advantages as a value-added investor. Markets characterized by tougher and lengthy entitlement processes that help either constrain or regulate supply, where a talented developer can grow its portfolio and create significant value through a deep level of understanding of its markets and skillful navigation of local politics.","Moving now to slide 14. Of course, these attributes hopefully are correlated with markets that demonstrates strong rent growth over the long-term, which is a critical component of return for a long-term investor, and something we consider to validate this preferred attributes. As you can see from this slide, over the last 15 years, Denver and Southeast Florida have actually compared favorably to our overall portfolio. This chart reflects market level rent growth over that time. Performance at the REIT level has been somewhat stronger. As you can see, Southeast Florida has performed stronger than our East Coast footprint, while Denver has performed in line with our Western markets.","Now to slide 15. One last point, I'd like to make is that these expansion markets enhance overall portfolio diversification. Southeast Florida in particular is not well correlated with our existing markets and both markets provide some diversification from the areas of greatest concentration, that being California and the Northeast.","At target allocation levels the portfolio is roughly split into three thirds; a third California, a third Northeast, and a third higher-growth markets. In terms of market penetration strategy, we expect that we'll invest both through acquisitions and development. And in addition, may choose to capitalize local developers to initially leverage their market knowledge and pipeline to help accelerate our expansion objectives. Of course, our tactics will ultimately be a function of value and opportunity as we have no set timetable to reach any target allocation. Smart capital allocation will remain the priority, it's always been, and we look to deploy capital appropriately across the cycle.","So, in summary, turning to slide 16, it was a solid quarter with core FFO above our outlook and the portfolio is well positioned headed into Q4. Development deliveries are tracking our mid-year reforecast and development should contribute meaningfully to FFO and NAV growth over the next two years to three years.","Our balance sheet is well-positioned to fund additional growth and protect the company from downside economic scenarios. And lastly, our strategy continues to evolve, as we are excited to add Denver and Southeast Florida to our market footprint, as we believe those markets contain many of the key attributes that allow us to create even more value for shareholders over time.","So, with that, Aaron we'd be happy to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, And we'll go first to Nick Joseph with Citi.","[0B8FLS-E Nick Joseph","Thanks. Tim, I appreciate your comments on the market expansion. But just wondering why now is the right time to expand into these new markets, and then how did you weigh market expansion against going deeper into your existing markets?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Nick, yeah, a fair question from a timing standpoint. Obviously, we're several years into the current cycle. Denver in particular just had a very nice run this cycle. I guess, I'd say a couple things; one, as it relates to acquisitions, we will be more cautious particularly with respect to sub-market focus, really trying to focus more on the sub-markets that we think are a bit more supply constrained given just sort of current recent trends.","As it relates to development, as I mentioned, we do anticipate using really, both acquisitions and development. I guess I'd say these markets as well as our existing footprint, the land frenzy is sort of behind us at this point. And we've also learned over time that to take advantage of any distress or downturn that might occur from any economic correction, you need to be in business.","And so, it's our attention to establish sort of beachheads in both those regions so that we are positioned to take advantage when the markets do turn. And then I did mention, willingness to look at development JVs, which we do think is a good way to tap into deals maybe that might deliver two years to three years out.","And so, when you think of sort of a mix of timeframes that you might get from acquisitions, development JVs or our own sponsored development, we think it sort of diversifies kind of our risk against any cycle risk that may be out there, as they have timeframes from now to four years or five years from now. As I mentioned, our long-term objective is to have a full-service office in each region. And I think one of our key competencies has been able to build great teams in our regions and to support them appropriately, essentially. As it relates to our existing markets, we're always looking to penetrate those markets more deeply. So it's always something to consider, and we don't think we're missing out opportunities today in our current markets.","But we do think there is an opportunity to expand our horizons a bit. As you know, as I mentioned earlier, we favor knowledge-based economies, and AvalonBay's markets, while we're heavily indexed there, we don't have a monopoly on knowledge-based jobs. I think it's kind of interesting, I think the Amazon HQ2 project is sort of evidence of that. Recently I've heard that Google, who as I understand allows employees to move to almost any market they want, has shutdown Denver recently because it was such a popular destination. So, it's a recognition that we think both these regions in a way provide a bit of a release valve \u2013 the Northeast in the case of Florida, Southeast Florida, and Denver in the case of California particularly, and particularly Northern California. So I don't know if that's entirely responsive to your question, but just a few thoughts.","[0B8FLS-E Nick Joseph","Thanks. Yeah, that was very helpful. And then just one follow-up, were there any other markets that you considered expanded into and then could further expansion be announced in the near or medium term?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. No. Thanks, Nick. Thanks for the follow-up. Well, first of all, I mean, every couple years, we always take a sort of a comprehensive look at our markets, and so it's something we've been thinking about honestly for the last 10 years or 15 years, whether we had the right footprint. In most cases, it resulted in us maybe exiting markets, as opposed to entering markets, and doubling down on our existing footprint, sort of along the lines of your earlier question.","But one of the reasons we're announcing Southeast Florida is because we did get that question a lot after we announced the acquisition in Denver, and this represents the two markets that we made a decision on today. So I don't think you should expect that that there's any near-term announcement of further expansion beyond this.","[0B8FLS-E Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America","Hi. I was just hoping you guys could give your latest thoughts on supply, kind of what we should expect for 2018 versus deliveries. In 2017, there's been some slippage. And which markets across your main regions stand out as improving or getting weaker in 2018, as you see it presently?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Juan, this is Sean. I'm happy to address that. What I can tell you is based on what people are communicating to us at present regarding the delivery of communities that may have under construction is, for deliveries in 2017, it's about 89,000 units. In our footprint, that's about 2.1% of inventory. And based on what's on the books today that we can see across our footprint \u2013 in 2018, it's about 98,000 units or about 2.3% of inventory. Based on recent history, particularly the difficult construction environment today in terms of labor availability and things of that sort and recent precedent in terms of delays that we're hearing from multiple developers out there, I'd expect a 2.1% for 2017 to actually come down a little bit as we get through the end of the year into January and look what actually completed, probably in the high 1% range would be my guess is where that comes out.","And so across the footprint, we would expect an increase in supply next year. My guess is, Q3 will look like 2.3% to 2.5%, maybe when you get to January. But what actually gets delivered next year probably will be less than that. But if you just look across the footprint, probably more supply in 2018 versus 2017. As it relates to the regional distribution, I can tell you that New England is expected to come down about 60 basis points next year, primarily a function of supply in the Boston market coming down.","And then, all the other markets are you know flat to up a little bit. The markets that are probably going to be up more significantly in the Pacific Northwest is projected to be up about 40 basis points from 3.5% to 3.9%. And then Southern California across all three major markets there, L.A., Orange County, and San Diego, it's expected to be up about 40 basis points. Most of that relates to an increase in supply in the Los Angeles market.","So what I'd generally say is, a little more supply in 2018 with the exception of the markets that I mentioned, and Boston in particular. And when you see a slowdown, it'd really be second half of 2018 deliveries before you start to see that. You know, we're running about 60 basis points of inventory on a quarterly basis right now. That's not expected to fall off until you get to basically Q3 of next year. So Q3 and Q4 start to fall off. So that's sort of the broad way to think about it, if that's helpful.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America","That is. And just a follow-up to that, if you can comment on your expectations for Northern California, and then also have you seen any impact on the availability of labor post the hurricanes in trying to complete developments?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. So, why don't I take the first one, and we can talk about the second one as well, probably Matt or Tim. But the first one, when you say expectations are you talking about supply expectations or...?","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America","Yes. Sorry.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. No problem. So, in terms of supply expectations, if you look into 2018, the only market that really of the three is expected to see a deceleration in deliveries is San Jose. It's running a little north of 3% of inventory right now. And for next year, we're expecting it to be in the low 2% range.","So, we expect to see a pretty material drop off in deliveries in the San Jose market in 2018, but it's relatively flat when you look at the East Bay and you look at San Francisco.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","I guess, I'll speak. This is Matt. I can speak a little bit to the second question about labor availability, and the impact of the hurricanes. It's probably too early to tell, it certainly seems reasonable to assume that it's going to impact the labor market particularly for construction, particularly for less skilled construction labor.","We haven't really seen that yet, obviously we're not building in the markets that have \u2013 were most directly impacted by the hurricane, but certainly, it's something to watch for as the rebuilding efforts gets started, which usually there is a little bit of a lag effect on that.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Hey, good morning, guys. Sean, really quickly, if you could run though new and renewals by market in the third quarter? And then I've got a follow-up to that. Thanks.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. As opposed to going through each one of the markets, there's 16 markets out there across six regions, happy to share that with you maybe offline as opposed to consuming a lot of time on that. But broadly speaking across the portfolio rent change for the third quarter was 2.5%, which is 4.1% on renewals and 90 basis points on move-in, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, but if that's okay, we can take the rest of the detail offline.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Yeah. No, that's fine. I appreciate that.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Second question, in the presentation the $111 million of NOI from development not in lease-up. Can you guys give us a sense of when over the course of the future that's supposed to hit roughly?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","I think that represents kind of all the deals that are on our development attachment that haven't yet started leasing. So, if you go to that attachment aid, it will lay out kind of which quarter they all start to expect leasing, but it's basically over the next, call it, two years, they'll go from starting leasing to stabilization.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Okay. All right. Thanks, Matt. That's it.","Operator","We'll go next to Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, thanks. In the past, you've talked about having around $1 billion of development starts annually. I'm wondering if that's still a good number, and whether you're thinking about raising that level because of signs of the apartment cycle lasting longer than expected?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Nick, this is Tim. If you look at our development rights pipeline, it kind of telegraphs kind of where development volumes are headed. I think, we have about $3.2 billion in development pipeline that tends to be you know the three years, three-plus years, maybe three and a half years' worth of pipeline. So it's still kind of in that $1 billion range, maybe a little less. As we've said in the past, we think it's probably going to trail off a bit, just given \u2013 even though the cycle is going longer, the economics are less compelling and less deals are sort of making it through the screen, if you will, and kind of hitting targets and we saw maybe earlier in the cycle just given where really the construction costs have gone and are going right now relative to rents.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Tim. One other question is you know for the future development projects you have on 96th Street in Second Avenue, there's been some press about this that the governor is kind of looking into the \u2013 the \u2013 whether it's parkland or not, and whether the project can go forward. Any sense on when and how this may get resolved? And if you could just remind us what the level of your investment is in that project? How much of that you know development right that you have on in the supplemental for New York accounts for that project? Thanks.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, Nick. This is Matt. Yes, that's an interesting question about what's the difference between a park and a playground, which apparently there's a legal distinction there, which matters to the governor and the mayor. So, we fully expect that that will get worked out, but it will take some time. I don't think we have great visibility yet in terms of how much time that might add to the predevelopment schedule. That is not a project that we expected to start in the next year, so we really view that as a next cycle deal in some ways, you know, maybe it's two years to three years away from starting, depending on how everything shakes out.","It does represent \u2013 I want to say, it's about $700 million, $650 million of the $3.2 billion in development rights. And just to be clear, that's a \u2013 that is a ground lease, so that actually doesn't reflect the value of the real estate.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just looking at the like-term rent growth that you outlined in your slide deck, track in a little bit ahead of last year, it looks like are in line-ish. I was just curious what markets are really driving the inflection? And then with the supply backdrop that you talked about, do you think that that remains stable into next year or we could see a pullback a bit?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Austin, this is Sean. Just to be clear as it relates to the rent change this year versus last year. Jason can probably walk through the numbers with you, but overall rent change is down this year relative to last year, as a function of really two things. One is the supply that we've talked about, and two is just a slower pace of job creation generally across the U.S. and in our markets, so rent change is down. In terms of inflection point, I think, the point we're trying to make is that rent change appears to be leveling off. We're basically around 2% to 2.5% all year long, and that we certainly aren't really talking much about guidance as it relates to next year, but trying to provide some context on the supply side in terms of what we might expect, which is similar to essentially slightly greater supply in 2018 as it relates to 2017.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","And just then maybe just to add to that, this is Tim. Just in terms of the macro, \u2013 as Sean said, we're not giving guidance for next year certainly, but in terms of the macro environment, I guess, we probably see more cross-wins than anything else. It is our expectation, Sean mentioned earlier, supply to tick up a little bit. I think, all things being equal, we probably expect job growth to tick down a little bit, just given unemployment being at such a low rate right now, and the difficulty of finding skilled labor, but those \u2013 that is offset by some sort of positive trends as well.","The Consumer and business confidence continues to increase, labor participation rates are on the rise a little bit, and wage growth is on the rise as well. We think all those things could help stimulate household formation. So, I think, there is \u2013 I think, there's probably going to be some offsets, but in general, we think it \u2013 it's probably shaping up to be a decent environment for 2018, without getting into much more detail in terms of how that might be translate into our portfolio.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I appreciate the detail, Tim. And then, just lastly for me, I was just curious what your thoughts were on, what you attribute the above average rent growth in both Southeast Florida and Denver over the last 15 years versus kind of the overall portfolio?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, it's really, it's been on the demand side. I mean, that the \u2013 the markets haven't suffered from supply and Denver is probably \u2013 probably has more than it should have right now. But \u2013 the \u2013 I'd say, the Sunbelt has actually performed quite well this cycle. Supply growth hasn't been \u2013 and at least in the Sunbelt hasn't been that much greater than some of our coastal markets, and it's had some pretty strong growth even in the \u2013 even in some of the areas that we thought we \u2013 our markets captured a lot of the \u2013 for instance, a lot of the higher tech jobs. We're seeing a lot of that \u2013 seeing a lot of that accumulate in some of the Sunbelt markets, and certainly it's true of Denver as well.","So I think, they've become \u2013 Denver has become a \u2013 become somewhat like \u2013 we're seeing that somewhat like we saw Seattle 10 years ago, becoming another kind of tech anchor in the Western U.S. And you know Southeast Florida certainly has benefited from some of the anti-growth initiatives perhaps in the Northeast over the last cycle or so.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And just one quick follow-up to that. I'm just curious how you think about the volatility of these markets through the cycle versus the existing portfolio?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, you know, great question. So, Denver would tend to be more volatile, and Southeast Florida would tend to be more stable. So, which- as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, Southeast Florida like D.C. is the one market that's sort of negative or not \u2013 not well-correlated with the rest of our footprint.","So, there's some appeal to us for that, and whereas Denver would be \u2013 would tend to track more what you see in the West Coast, which means you \u2013 you got to be careful in terms of how you allocate capital over the course of the cycle, and be a lot more sort of thoughtful from a timing perspective.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Good morning. GGP discussed on its earnings call a JV agreement with you to build multi-family in one of their Seattle malls. How big of an opportunity is this for you as far as developing an existing retail?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. This is Tim here. Yeah, we are aware that GGP announced an agreement in principle on a single project in Northern Seattle. You know, there's \u2013 you know, every time there's been a structural change in the economy that's resulted in massive repurposing of real estate. It's tended to happen over a longer period of time when you move from agriculture to manufacturing, as you move from manufacturing to more information based economy.","I think, there are a number of trends right now that we're going to \u2013 that's just only going to accelerate, whether it's \u2013 it's happening in the area of digital commerce, which is relevant to GGP. But in terms of things we're seeing in the sharing economy, the blurring of work with play, just the nature of work changing just based upon knowledge-based jobs. I think, that's \u2013 we think that's going to have a big impact in terms of the need to repurpose real estate over the next 10 years to 15 years. And a lot of great real estate has been consolidated over the last 15 years to 20 years. And so, we think there is an opportunity to partner with some of these owners that have consolidated great \u2013 great real estate during that period time, when high density housing is part of the solution, when it comes to repurposing.","In terms of the form of that partnership, it's going to take different forms than it has already on deals that we've done. It might just mean helping them re-plan it and splitting the property, and just taking a piece of it for residential for ourselves and letting the existing owners sort of re-plan or take the rest of the property. It may be more of a condo structure, like we had at Assembly Row with Federal, where we may be building the retail and deeding it back to them, sort of in a condo structure. We own the retail \u2013 own the residential, they own the retail; or maybe a JV structure, which we're working through with GGP, where we own together the residential component, and generally we'll be amenable to that structure where we think we have a partner on the other side, where there's a clear alignment of interest, or long-term owners. Both believe sort of in the long-term viability of that location and the real estate. But we think it's going to be a big opportunity over the next 10 years or 15 years to be playing a role sort of in the repurposing of, like I said, just really great real estate that's going to need to shift its usage based upon some of these larger longer-term trends that we're seeing.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So as far as control rights or ownership of land, are the characteristics pretty similar to freestanding multi-family, are there major differences, or it depends on the benchmark?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","So, I think, it's \u2013 I think, it depends. I kind of outlined three structures there and one \u2013 in the first case, it'd be analogous to what we do today. And you basically own and control the residential component. And the second case, it may be again sort of a more of a condo structure, where we're owning one piece of it, of the sandwich, so to speak, and they're owning the ground plain. And in other case, is this going to make sense to venture it. And we're going to have to -- we're going to \u2013 there is going to be mutual consent rights, as it relates to \u2013 as it relates to the asset, whether financing sale or anything else.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then a question on CapEx on our numbers AvalonBay spent least amount of CapEx both revenue enhancing and maintenance CapEx in this sector. Can you just describe why that's the case? Do you just see better returns in developments or asset recycling, or is it just a reflection of the average age of your portfolio?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, John, I'm happy to address that. You know, if you look at our CapEx for last year and this year, call it roughly 5% of NOI. And \u2013 but if you look at \u2013 that's kind of the recurring CapEx. If you look at revenue enhancing, yeah, fair point, we're spending about $50 a unit on that, which is dramatically lower than most of our peers. As you may know, the -we separate out our redevelopment bucket and we invest in our asset separate from the same-store pool, which is something that we think is important for investors to understand in terms of how we're allocating that capital and the returns that we generate on that capital.","So that certainly has something to do with it. In terms of the nature of the portfolio, certainly you can go through our portfolio relative to others and look at age and things of that sort. But all those factors play into it and we want to make sure that we're being thoughtful about the timing of CapEx whether it's both defensive and offensive in nature to make sure that we're investing at the appropriate time in the asset and that we're also demonstrating to investors the returns that we're earning by investing in sort of offensive-oriented CapEx. So, hopefully that makes sense, and your other questions have been answered.","John P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I'll follow offline. Thank you.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","We'll go next to Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning. I noticed in the development disclosure quite a bit of progress on the leasing front, if you look at projects delivering over the next \u2013 really the first units delivering over the next three quarters or four quarters, at the same time, the average yield on the pipeline ticked down a bit. I'm just wondering if there is anything strategic going on in terms of maybe conceding a little bit on price to increase the velocity of leasing or is that something that's just related to things moving in and out of the pipeline?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Drew, this is Sean. I'll take part of that, and then if Tim or Matt want to jump in, they're welcome to. But in terms of leasing velocity, there is no question that in some markets in particular to the extent that we're either trying to close out the leasing of a community or we're starting \u2013 kind of jumpstarting it, particularly in the third quarter that we will yield a little more on price to get that velocity, either to get the initial lift as I mentioned or to finish up.","And I said that was particularly the case as it relates to both North Station and Dogpatch this quarter. To give you a sense, on Dogpatch, as an example, we leased and occupied 32 and 36 a month during the quarter, and rents certainly took a little bit of a hit on that one as it relates to trying to push the velocity before we get into the seasonal slower fourth quarter.","In addition on Dogpatch, it's early in the delivery, it's going to have all the amenities, just still heavy construction.","So, you tend to yield a little bit more on price during that period of time. So the real rents there we probably won't know until the spring. And now in North Station, we were just trying to accelerate the completion of that project in terms of the lease-up. We're in the 70% plus range there in terms of lease and occupy percentage. We delivered some larger penthouses late this summer that we're trying to get occupied instead of having them sit there for the winter. So, things like that come into play at asset level, execution plans and you certainly see that reflected in the rents on some of the assets on the development attachment.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hey, Drew. This is Matt. Just to follow-up on that, as it relates to the overall yield, the yield on the development bucket last quarter I think it was a 6.0% and this quarter it's a 5.8%. And probably about half of that 20 basis point reduction is just changes to the bucket, deals that completed in the second quarter that are not in that bucket anymore that were higher yielding. And then the other half of it call it the other 10 basis points is the little bit of erosion from last quarter in developments that we're leasing both quarters, and a lot of that's just the deals that Sean mentioned.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. That's very helpful. And then I wanted to dig in a little bit on the Lakewood acquisition being that it's kind of the only case study so far in this growth market plan for Denver and Southeast Florida. Specifically in Lakewood, what's unique about that market in terms of barriers to entry, sort of, the Mindy concept, and specific demand drivers that may be directly in that market?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure. This is Matt, I can take that one as well. It is definitely a submarket that's seeing a lot less supply than most of the submarkets in Denver. A lot of the product in Denver is being delivered downtown. This is Lakewood North, it's really on the border between Lakewood and Golden, it's off of I-70 in a master planned kind of controlled community called Denver West, which includes the National Laboratory for Renewable Energy, it includes a fair amount of office, there is Mills Mall across the freeway that was part of it. So the immediate environment is, it's highly controlled by one family that's kind of built it out over the course of decades. But then even beyond that when you get out into the broader submarket of which it's a part, Golden is on a permit allocation system, so there is a lot of supply constraints there.","And then Lakewood has its own jurisdiction. It's not as restrictive as Golden, but it's certainly not as permissive as Denver. So it is an area that's seeing less supply, and I think generally what you see in Denver is the further west you go, the more supply constrained it gets, and some of that's regulatory and some of that is topographical, you start to get up into the mountains. And this asset is really in the foothills. It's a great place to live, it's for people that are looking to get out on the mountains on the weekend, which is part of that Denver lifestyle, which is so appealing to so many folks.","So, we were pretty excited about it, and I think it is a reflection of kind of the locational strategy we're going to take there. At this particular point in the cycle, there's a lot of activity and a lot of excitement about downtown, a lot of people want to live there. There is a lot of new product being delivered. At some point, pricing may make sense to us there, but for right now we felt that this offered a much better risk adjusted return.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Looking at the retail densification opportunity, do you underwrite the developments on a standalone basis looking at supply and demographics or does the quality of the retail asset influence the decision?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. This is Tim here. Well, certainly, the quality of the retail asset is oftentimes reflective of the quality of the location. And so, to the extent it's a better location, we're going to demand probably a lower going in yield, with the expectation we're going to make more of a return on growth over time. But certainly the existing retail, if it's dying retail, and the whole site needs to be sort of redeveloped, that's a very different kind of risk profile. We'd consider it, but it's more of a master plan exercise, and it is sort of surgically where you're going in and maybe pick off part of the parking field or taking down one of the anchors and sort of re-planning some sort of a lifestyle project that integrates into the existing mall.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And at what point do you enter these decisions, are the projects largely entitled or do you take your skillset and work through the local entitlement process?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","No, we're partnering in many cases with the owner of the real estate. We think one of the things we offer them is both capital and skill and talent, and so they're leveraging both as part of the relationship. So, typically, it's kind of the deals I just described; we'd be sharing in the pre-development work, we'd be taking most of the lead, as it relates to design and entitlement, but obviously we'd be working alongside with them during that process.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then lastly, you guys talked a lot about volatility, returns and correlations, just wondering how you at the top down view your portfolio. Do you view like sort of a Sharpe ratio and is that the reason, maybe the volatility in Northern California, New York was a little too volatile this quarter, and you just wanted to balance it out, is that why there's was a reduction in those regions?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","No, not really. I mean, when you look at New York and Northern California, probably just- with respect to going to California, thinking long term, we just felt like we're probably a little more over-indexed there at 20% of our existing portfolio relative to the size of the market and our overall portfolio. I mean, Southern California is a much bigger geography, and so even if we were at a market index at Southern California, and over-indexed in Northern California, Southern California would still be a bigger part of our portfolio. So, it's probably we're not necessarily scared by volatility, because a lot of times you can diversify that way through other markets. But we are mindful of when the markets are more volatile is how we invest through the course of the cycle, because total returns do matter, when you enter \u2013 when you invest the initial capital.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates.","Hardik Goel - Zelman & Associates","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Just on the like-term rent change, you guys did 1.9% in October and then if you look at occupancy, it was up 20 basis points, so you could say like-term revenue was up 2.1% in October. What was that compared to last year?","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","I don't have October last year right in front of me, so I am happy to get back to you on that offline.","Hardik Goel - Zelman & Associates","All right. And just one more quick follow-up. When you say your exposure, you're going to take it out in New York, I guess, the target exposure is lower there, where in New York, because your portfolio is so diversified, and there's a lot of urban, there is a lot of suburban. Have you guys kind of outlined which assets you're going to look to sell and where are those assets typically?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Maybe a mix of urban and suburban over time. Right now, we're at 24%, we talked about our target being 20%. I don't have numbers right in front of me, but it's sort of roughly split between urban and suburban right now. More recently, we've been selling some of our suburban New York portfolio, in part because that's where we have a deep development pipeline.","We've been able to create a lot of value in Northern New Jersey. And then to some extent, it's strategic. We've been selling out of parts of Connecticut, particularly the Northern Fairfield and areas north of that.","Hardik Goel - Zelman & Associates","Thanks. That's all from me.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Guinee with Stifel.","John William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Oh, John Guinee here. Thank you very much. Talking a little bit about development. First, hard costs last 12 months, how much have they gone up, and has land adjusted down yet to reflect that increase in hard costs?","And then second \u2013 and if you answered this, I apologize, but what yield on cost do you expect in Denver and South Florida, higher yield on cost, or lower yield on cost? And what kind of product do you build in for example the various South Florida markets, where Miami to West Palm Beach is probably 75 miles, 80 miles distance?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, John. This is Matt. As it relates to the first question, we see hard costs have been growing probably through the course of this year in kind of the mid-to-high single-digits, depending on what market you're in. So, they're still growing well faster than inflation and faster than rents. So you're right. In the long run, that would impact land valuation. I'm not sure we've seen land values drop yet, but we've certainly seen terms start to soften a little bit in most markets, and land pricing in general is not continuing to go up, maybe with one or two exceptions.","So that's always the first step and it does take a while for the market to adjust, and there's plenty of deals in the pipeline that are out looking for financing. But some of those deals are not penciling the way that sponsors thought they would. So we do expect that there should be continued softening there. But it's certainly, as we sit here today, it's definitely continuing to get harder to find business that underwrites today because it takes a while for that to play itself out, that process.","As it relates to yields and product in the expansion markets, cap rates I think in Denver and Southeast Florida are probably pretty similar to what we see, say, in our DC markets or in Boston. They're a little higher than the West Coast, they're little lower than some of the suburban Northeast stuff. So, therefore, we'd be looking for yields probably roughly similar to that kind of low-to-mid 6%s, depending on the product and the submarket and the location. And our early indications are certainly that folks are finding success and finding deals that meet that criteria over time.","Yes, Southeast Florida is a very diverse market, that's one of the things we like about it. And ultimately over time, just like in our other markets, we would look to have exposure. You look across kind of our portfolio in Metro New York, in Metro DC and Metro Boston, we have everything from wood frame, garden, apartments, there are three stories in some of the further out suburbs to a lot of kind of mid-rise wrap and podium products that's in field suburbs to high rises downtown. And all of those products can be supported in Southeast Florida at different levels.","One of the big differences in Florida obviously, just because of the hurricane curse (52:43), none of its wood frame, it's all concrete but the costs are very different in these different markets. So, you can develop. Certainly what we've seen is many private developers have been able to develop profitably in that market as well across all those different product types.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hey, John, it's Tim here, maybe, just follow-up, just briefly on the land question. Yeah, Matt is right, I mean, the land markets really haven't adjusted. Our focus really has been on, one, as it relates to new development, in some cases, densifying our own assets where we've got excess parking, where we could take advantage of it, do negotiate the transactions either with folks that are looking to repurpose some of their assets and, thirdly, RPs where we're negotiating basically land residual values with jurisdiction. So, those efforts are bearing more fruit than just kind of going through the open market because in many cases the land economics still make no sense. I don't think we've tied anything up in Northern California maybe in three years, from terms of land standpoint.","So, we're using a lot of different strategies to continue to sort of look at opportunities, but most of them are strategies that do allow for some adjustment to the land bases through a negotiated process.","John William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Excellent. Don't slow down. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. So, what are the, I guess, more macro trends we're seeing is some declines in bank lending to multifamily, maybe that's because there's less demand from owners given decline in transaction volumes or maybe that's because of tighter lending standards. But I am wondering if you're seeing any slowdown in supply as a result of declining loan growth, or is the supply that's in the pipeline pretty much baked at this point?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Rich, this is Sean. In terms of what's in the pipeline today for 2017 and 2018, that's pretty much baked given the duration of the construction cycle. What you're really referring to is deals that might be starting in the fourth quarter or sometime in 2018 and delivering in 2019 and 2020.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Certainly, we're hearing about the exact trend you're speaking to, as it relates to the tighter lending environment. Several of us were just at ULI just over a week ago, and heard about that a fair bit from a number of the private developers, both longer-term owners and particularly on the merchant builders side, and they're going to their second, third or fourth tier bank to try to get a deal done.","So, certainly it's putting more pressure on them in terms of how they're thinking about their deals and the equity sources that are available to fund the gap because typically the deals that are getting done, the loan to cost ratios are coming in a little bit lower than earlier in the cycle. So, between that \u2013 between where construction costs are today and the expectation that based on what we see in the environment, there is the potential for construction costs in some markets to run above rent growth. It certainly is going to be a regulator on supply beyond what's already in the pipeline.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And is there any markets that makes you maybe more bullish or less bullish on?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","As it relates to the same-store portfolio or...","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, really just overall in terms of \u2013 look, you are a well-capitalized entity, some of the maybe merchant builders are less well-capitalized. And so, are you seeing opportunities in some markets where maybe some of the smaller competitors are starting to pull back or is it too early to see that?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","I'd say at this point and Matt and Tim can certainly come in as well. But I'd say it's probably a little too early for that, people have their deals capitalized sort of already started obviously. Question is what they may have in their pipeline that once they get the permits, once they figure out what the costs are, what the economics are, does it make sense? I'd say we've probably seen a little bit of that, but not a substantial amount at this point. It'll probably take a little bit of time for that to bleed through in terms of opportunities don't get done, and therefore someone's looking to recycle land, so probably a little early in the cycle for that.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","This is Tim. And we have seen, we've started to see some opportunities sort of recycle, maybe land deals we looked at two years or three years ago that maybe less experienced sponsors guided to, and didn't sort of fully understand the economics of what they were taking on either in terms of predevelopment requirements, or frankly the construction costs. So you're starting to see a little bit of that. It's happening more in some of the markets, as I mentioned earlier like Northern California or Seattle, which tend to be a little bit more volatile and maybe there are some folks that are experiencing sort of the wrong side of that volatility at the moment either in terms of what the numerator or the denominator is telling them when they're running their performance.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys. I'll follow up offline with any further questions.","Operator","We'll go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning. Just two quick questions here. First on Southeast Florida geographically, did you guys outline \u2013 are you more concentrating in Miami and the immediate market sort of a little north, a little south or are you going all the way up to West Palm, if you could just outline your thoughts?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, this is Matt. We are interested in having a presence in all three of the metro areas there: Fort Lauderdale, West Palm and Miami. So, it's going to be a function of where transaction volume is both on the acquisition and development side, but we certainly, over time would be interested in having a presence in all three of those submarkets.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then, Tim, on your comments on a little deemphasizing New York and San Francisco, how much of that is just a function that the markets on an absolute basis have gotten too expensive, whether it's on cost to develop or acquire or the absolute rent levels needed to make sense and sort of the other markets may have a broader tenant base and economic base to allow more deals and allow a broader renter profile. So, how much of de-weighting Northern California and New York is based on pure economics and cost?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","I guess, Alex, it's partly that \u2013 in the case of New York, I mean part of it's just the total size of our overall portfolio. So, we're more comfortable with something closer to 20% than 25%, as it relates to weighting and particularly, when you combine it with Boston. In the Northeast, those have been good markets, long term, but there are some challenges at the same time, whether it's California, Northeast just from a tax base and the like.","So part of it is, just a little bit of additional diversification providing other growth opportunities beyond Northeast and California, which as I said earlier, some of these markets tend to be a little bit more volatile. Timing is important, it's important in New York, it's important in San Francisco, and so sometimes, you just sort of need to be out of the market. In some of these other markets, provide some opportunity to fill in some of the holes as you just kind of pursue your growth strategy.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Just following up again on the Denver and Southeast Florida strategy, these two markets were also the markets that EQR got out of about two years ago. I am just wondering, could you talk a little bit about what their exposure was versus what you're targeting to kind of get a sense, it's the same stuff? Are you looking at different property type, are you looking at different submarkets? I'm just trying to get a sense of, they got out two years ago and now you guys are getting in and I'm just trying to understand why?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, I mean I think you probably need to talk to EQR to ask them why they got out. But I don't think their portfolios were particularly urban, and I think they are probably older. And as Mark said, maybe that played a role, I don't know, but that's them, obviously, they've made a bet on more of an urban footprint, so that may have played a role.","In our case, we're starting from scratch and so we're looking at trying to build the portfolio that we want to build long term in each of those markets and as Matt had mentioned earlier, I think the Denver West acquisition was representative of the kind of business we want to do when we think that there is a \u2013 when there is maybe an opportunity in a supply constrained market \u2013 when there is plenty of supply generally in the market and there'll be other times when there'll be opportunity in supply-driven markets, so. But we said many times, we're agnostic between urban and suburban. We're capable of developing and operating both, and we're going to be looking for value at different parts of the cycle where it's most compelling.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Second question, the installation of the Amazon Lockers at some of your locations, could you talk a little bit about just exactly what you are hoping to gain from that? Is it just better management of that process, is it actually something that ends up dropping to your bottom line? Could you talk about any kind of cost savings that you expect to kind of get from this and just how much more could you kind of see a rollout of Amazon Lockers in your properties?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes. Tayo, this is Sean. Just to address this briefly, we did reach an agreement with Amazon to install either lockers or a package room across our portfolio, or at least a percentage of our portfolio, and if it goes well, we'll probably expand that. I mean the benefit is multiple and just highlight maybe a couple of things. One is just customer convenience that you can pretty much access. The package has been delivered to you 24x7. So regardless of your lifestyle, your work hours, whatever it may be, you can have access to it whenever you want as opposed to when someone's there.","And also, it allows us to probably be a little more efficient in terms of our team given the number of packages that we receive. There is more than a couple of million packages here. So, it's a pretty significant time allocation in terms of labor hours associated with each one of those packages. Just to give you some simple numbers, we've kind of run through the math and by the time you receive a package, log in a package, store it, when the customer shows up, you retrieve it, you log it out, you have them sign it, et cetera. It can be three minutes or four minutes of time for each one of those packages, so labor hours definitely adds up. So that's the primary economic benefit associated with the Amazon Lockers at this point. And we'll see how it plays out in terms of other opportunities with them as well.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","But could you talk a little bit about just on a estimated cost savings, something like this could give you, whether it's on a per building basis or something like that?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, it's a little too early to lay that out. I mean, you pick up some time for someone who's there doing that but they also are doing various other things. So across the portfolio, we certainly expect to pick up something, but we haven't quantified it yet since we're early in the process.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Good morning. I saw retail bad debt expense picked up in the quarter. Could you speak to a little bit of that, and then given that you're seeing opportunities to redevelop other retail, could you tell us a little bit about your strategy for your existing retail?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Conor, it's Sean. I'm happy to address the first one, and then Matt or Tim may have comments on the second one as well. But on the first one, it was really one tenant that blew out in New York City, that we wrote off during the quarter, it was around $600,000, and this was reflected in the write-off in the comments, in the office operation section of the expense attachment, so it's that one write-off.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","As it relates to the existing retail \u2013 Conor, this is Matt \u2013 we have about 600,000 feet I believe and across our stabilized portfolio and existing retail, and we've actually focused quite a bit in the last couple of years on increasing the occupancy, that I think we brought the occupancy on that retail up from maybe low 80%s to high 80%s, around 90%, over the last three years or four years. So, it's mostly small shop space. So, I'm not sure if there's any huge opportunities there, but there are select situations. We have a couple of high profile retail locations where there might be opportunities over time as tenants turnover coming out of some longer term, older leases, but it really is a grab bag and it's a 1,000 feet here, 2,500 feet there. So, I don't know if there's any huge opportunities there.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Great. Thank you. And then given that your current development rights are pretty heavy on New York and New Jersey, and your longer-term plan to decrease your allocation in that region. How does that fit or how should we think about you're going to be backfilling the development rights pipeline?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Conor. This is Matt again. I guess one of the reasons why you've seen our disposition activity in the last couple of years be a little more heavily concentrated in Metro New York, New Jersey is because of that. So, I think we've sold something like $900 million or $1 billion out of Metro New York in the last couple of years. Mostly in the suburbs, we did sell Christie Place maybe three years ago now. So, we are mindful of that in terms of keeping the portfolio in balance. And we have not been doing many acquisitions in that region. So, all of our growth there has been through development. So, over time, it's a big ship and how you turn it, it gets to kind of the incremental decisions you make on dispositions, but it is still where we're finding tremendous yield in terms of development opportunities. So, we're mindful of that and try and balance that with decisions. I think Tim wanted to add something on it.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, yeah, Conor. I think when we talk about target portfolio, it's in the future. I mean, we are expecting to grow the overall portfolio. So, we may not necessarily shrink on an absolute basis the New York Metro area, but we will look to recycle capital within our market as we develop. So, I think that's kind of the short answer.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Okay. Great. Then finally, on that same theme within the Bay Area, do you have any plans to shift your allocation within the three regions or hold it pretty constant?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Nothing too specific at the moment, Conor. We're pretty well distributed between the three regions today. So, I think it's going to be probably a little more asset by asset. Over the 20%, we're roughly between 6% and 8% split between Oakland, San Francisco, and San Jose today. So, we like having a presence in each of those markets. So, it's probably going to be probably a bit more opportunistic in terms of what we think sort of the better value from a dispo standpoint sort of presents itself.","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thanks. Tim, in the beginning of the call, you said you're expanding into other markets in part just kind of be in business should there be an opportunity if the cycle turns downward or something along those lines. Can you just describe your mindset there? Are you feeling just because the number of years is increasing in terms of how long we've been in this cycle that you have to be a little bit more cautious on the future, despite the view on supply maybe coming down next year or am I reading into that too much?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","No. Richard, I think it's a good question. Yeah. It's just a recognition that economic cycles don't last forever. Having said that, they don't generally die of old age, they die of distortion and we're not seeing a lot of distortions today whether it's in the capital markets or labor markets that suggests we're at the end of the road today. But we do see construction costs and rents that are kind of above trend and those tend to sort of migrate back towards trend over time. But the one mistake I think a lot of developers make at times is they wait for markets to recover and to see clear evidence that development is profitable before they get in and oftentimes it's three years or four years after you want to be in from a \u2013 particularly from taking a land position, so you kind of need to be feeling what the land markets are like today to be able to sort of understand when the opportunity might be more right rather than sort of do it on a hindsight basis. So it's just kind of what our experience tells us. Oftentimes, the best land deals are either done after there's an economic correction or just before if it's done on an option basis where you can often times sort of renegotiate your transaction sort of after the dust has settled.","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And second question is, and this can be a simple yes or no answer, but as preeminent developer of apartments in the U.S., have you been approached by any cities as a means to sort of sweeten the proposal to attract Amazon's HQ2 like Denver, for example? I'm just kidding about that but anything along those lines?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","There's really nothing there, Rich.","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Nothing there. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Pehl with Goldman Sachs.","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just wondering if you could touch on your urban versus suburban rent growth in Northern California and Metro New York\/ New Jersey, and Boston? You had a slide in your 1Q 2017 presentation, and I'm just wondering if you can give an update on that?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Jeff, this is Sean. Maybe the way I can answer that for you is say a little bit about blended rent change in what you might think about, you said Northern California was one market I heard. Just to give you a sense in terms of blended rent change in the third quarter, not a lot different. The East Bay basically was 1.8%, San Francisco was 1.4%, San Jose was only 70 basis points, but that was constrained by the Mountain View rent ordinance, rent control ordinance that was put into effect. So it's got some noise in it in terms of San Jose, so be mindful of that. And I am sorry the second market that you indicated was?","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Metro New Jersey and New York and then Boston?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes, okay. Boston, I don't have it broken out right in front of me in terms of urban versus suburban rent change during the quarter. Boston overall was in the low 3% range. In terms of New York\/New Jersey, that's a little bit easier to break out, because it's represented by the geography. But to give you a sense, the strongest performing market within our footprint of New York\/New Jersey was Long Island, where we had rent change around 3%, followed by Central Jersey at about 2.5% and then the city of New Jersey, both around 2%. The weakest was actually our Westchester portfolio, it was around 1%, which is a relatively small basket, and it has some movement of one or two assets, it can move the needle. So I wouldn't read too much into that.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hey, Sean, but maybe you could just talk just suburban versus urban rent growth, East Coast versus West Coast what we're seeing right now, maybe how that compared sort of couple of quarters ago just to...?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, in terms of urban versus suburban performance, we typically look at the Axiometrics data, and then overlay that with our own portfolio data in terms of urban versus suburban performance. One thing just to keep in mind is when we started talking about these kinds of numbers, sample size does matter. And we're about two-third suburban, so just keep that in mind.","It's not going to be consistent across each and every market in terms of our portfolio allocation between urban and suburban, but across the footprint for our portfolio, urban growth was around 140 basis points versus suburban about 260 basis points. So, 120 basis points spread in the third quarter, as it relates to performance. And again, that's our own portfolio of data as compared to Axiometrics, which is a little bit wider in terms of suburban versus urban, it's closer to 300 basis points, but they have a much bigger sample obviously that they are reporting against as compared to our own portfolio.","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And do you think suburban can continue to outperform urban in 2018?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Based on what we know about supply, that would be the expectation. If you look at the deliveries both 2017 and 2018, skew high on urban submarkets. So, if you break apart that, call it roughly 2% of inventory, it's in the high 1% range for suburban, and then, it's also north of 3% for urban. So, you blend it together and you get to sort of that 2.1% to 2.3% that I was mentioning earlier. So, given that expectation for deliveries, there certainly is good absorption in the urban submarkets, but there is just too much supply coming online this year and next year in those environments.","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then, just my second question real quick. The U.S. homeownership rate has ticked up a little bit recently. Just wondering if you have an update across your portfolio on move-outs to purchase a home, and if there's any markets maybe that are above average for that?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure. The move-outs to purchase home still has not moved really. This cycle, it's still running around 13% of move-outs. And one thing that we've noticed, and it's been highlighted by a couple of different research firms, is that what we're seeing in the data would indicate that people that have been in some single family rentals are moving into home ownership. And I think, not only for ourselves, but a number of our peers in our markets aren't really seeing the move-outs to home purchase change much. It sort of makes sense based on what we're seeing.,","And then as it relates to any particular markets that are above or below their long-term average, typically what you'd see is the Northeast, particularly Boston is a market that's trending right around or slightly above its long-term average in terms of move-outs to home purchase, which is running right around 22%, 23%. Pretty much all the other markets are at or below their long-term average. And to give you a sense, Northern California is trending around 9% or 10%. The long-term average is closer to 14%. Southern California is pretty much right at its long-term average, so Boston is really the only region where we're seeing that occur at this point.","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Mr. Joseph, your line is open, sir. Please check your mute function.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Can you hear me? Can you hear me, now?","Operator","Yeah. We got you.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right, it's Bilerman. Tim, I was wondering, I know 10 years could be a pretty long time in terms of where the company is going to be, and I think back to last 10 years, you've almost tripled in size. This is pre-Archstone obviously, from $13 billion of assets to $34 billion today at that market. And even post-Archstone, you've grown probably by about a third from call it $25 billion to $34 billion. So, as I think about your 10-year forward look in terms of your portfolio construction, how do you think about the sizes, the portfolio look in that context? Could we see that growth continue or do you really view this as sort of a steady state type plan, where everything is self-funded, both development as well as growth into new markets via acquisition and new development?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Michael that's a pretty loaded question. I mean, first of all, on scale, we do think there are certain advantages of scale. There's a lot of advantages of scale at the regional level, it's one of the reasons why we have been committed to the footprint that we have been committed to, and in many cases had exited markets to redeploy that capital into existing markets to develop scale. You can recruit higher caliber talent into markets when you've got a bigger presence, you can leverage business intelligence in ways that are important particularly if you're a value-add investor or developer in those markets.","So we are clearly believers in scale at the regional level. We're a believer in terms of the kind of capabilities that you can build over time, whether it's things like revenue management and other things that you can deploy where it's not just a matter of just turning a button on, it's supporting that with great market research and data analytics that allow you to sort of optimize it. So all things being equal, we like scale, but this is a capital-intensive business, it's only going to make sense to grow the balance sheet at certain points in the cycle, and at other times, it may make sense to contract the balance sheet or to recycle.","So I would say, we have no hard and fast objectives about how big this company should be or ought to be. To some extent, we're a little bit beholden to the capital markets or cost of capital in terms of how we deploy. But we do want to achieve certain levels of presence within the markets that we choose to be and we wouldn't go in the Southeast Florida or Denver unless we thought we could build a portfolio of a few thousand units over time that would allow us to achieve some of those other strategic advantages.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And it sounds at least from your initial comments that doing some potential development JVs, approaching acquisitions cautiously is at least some initial ways. I remember back, I can't remember if it was 2011 or 2012 when you did the exchange with UDR, the SoCal Boston exchange. Could that be an avenue where other REITs may be over indexed or under indexed to the markets you want to get out of, and over indexed to the ones you want to get into. Is that something that we potentially could see you execute?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","It's something we would have interest in to the extent that there was complementary objectives within that. I don't know whether it's public or private. And then with respect to development JVs, one thing I didn't mention, we are sponsoring local developers. It's going to generally be a structure where I think there's a path to getting sort of full fee ownership of the asset, that's different than maybe kind of a retail JV that we're talking about earlier with respect to GGP where that really is strategic and where interests are aligned long-term and where it might be more of a 50-50 structure on a go forward basis.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then moving to last question just on that slide 13, the conceptual presentation of your circles on the quarter moons, half moons, just visually when you look at those items, right, everything in Southeast Florida and Denver is below what your legacy markets are. And so, I guess if these are your market attributes and even though Southeast Florida and Denver arguably are higher than what you define as the U.S. market metro average is a half moon. They're still relatively below what your legacy markets are, right. If you did this chart in 10 years and you exceed your plan, all your legacy, your new moons would all have more white ones?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. This is a current assessment of these markets. First of all, if they were more filled in than our existing markets, we would be there already. And so to some extent, you are projecting a little bit too with respect to these markets in terms of how they might perform in the future for instance on these sort of knowledge-based economy. Do we think Denver will get more than its fair share of those kinds of jobs, we do kind of going forward.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","So I mean, when you look at public investment and infrastructure, I mean, what Denver and the State of Colorado are doing and what's happening in Southeast Florida, it's pretty impressive, whether it's public transportation or some of the amenities that the public sector is supporting and investing in. So I mean, we are in the long-term investment business and so we are looking at longer-term trends as to where people want to live, the kind of people we rent to as well as what's the posture of the government sector in terms of supporting those metro areas. So, we'd like to think that these circles will continue to fill in a bit over time as we get to understand these markets and they continue to mature.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. Do you feel like the institutional core capital will come as well, right? You think about your current markets, that strong institutional core bid that will allow you to exit at times you feel like...?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","It's already started, Michael. We're already investing in these markets.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. And see, now there may not be a big REIT presence in these markets, honestly, it's one of the reasons we're kind of attracted to them at this particular moment in time where there's not a lot of people that bring the full complement of advantages that we could bring to these markets, whether it's talent or capital.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","So, it kind of presents sort of an interesting opportunity from a competitive standpoint.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great.

Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may now begin your conference.","Jason Reilley - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thank you, Cassie. And welcome to AvalonBay Communities first quarter 2018 earnings conference call.","Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially.

Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q1 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Sean, Kevin, and I will provide some management commentary on the slides that we posted last night, and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.","Our comments will focus on providing an overview of the macro environment and the impact on fundamentals, some color on our operating results this quarter, and lastly, some thoughts related to development and funding activity.","Starting now on the slide 4, highlights for the quarter include core FFO growth of 4.3%. Same-store revenue growth came in at 2.4%, or 2.3% when you include redevelopment. We completed $300 million new development this quarter at an average initial projected yield of 6.5%, which is helping drive earnings and NAV growth per share.","And lastly, we raised $300 million in external capital this quarter through a 30-year unsecured debt issuance with an effective rate of just under 4% for the first 10 years. This is the third time we've tapped the 30-year market over the last two years for almost $1 billion in total issuance. And as a result, we've extended our average maturity of outstanding debt to over 10 years.","Turning now to slide 5, just talk about the economy for a moment. The housing and apartment markets are benefiting from a healthy economy, which appears to be gaining momentum early in 2018, and that shows few signs of slowing down eight years into the current expansion.","GDP is growing at a rate of close to 3% and we're seeing sustained job growth of roughly 200,000 per month. Over the last couple of years, a tightening labor market has pushed wage growth to its cyclical high, and household formation appears to be gaining momentum after growing modestly through much of this cycle.","Turning to slide 6, indications are that the expansions should continue into the foreseeable future, as consumers and businesses are feeling good about their prospects. The emerging consensus among economists is that this expansion will ultimately become the longest in our lifetime. There's plenty to support this thesis, including consumer and corporate balance sheets that are very strong, and increasingly both the consumer and businesses are putting dry powder to work in the form of higher consumption, greater capital investment and increased hiring.","So the economy seems poised to maintain its momentum for the next couple of years, which should continue to support healthy demand in the apartment markets.","I want to turn now to slide 7 and let's take a look at the supply side. As we discussed previously, supply is elevated in our markets versus historical averages, but does appear to be approaching a cyclical peak this year. Over the next few quarters, we expect new deliveries in our markets to reach right around 25,000 per quarter, before drifting down to just under 20,000 per quarter later next year.","And despite an uptick in multi-family starts nationally over the last quarter, our starts have been relatively stable in our markets over the last few months, due to increases in land and construction costs combined with higher interest rates. Construction costs, in particular, are now growing at a rate well above rents, in the mid- to high-single-digit range, which is putting pressure on the economics of new development.","To be clear, we don't anticipate a significant decline in new supply over the next two to three years, but rather a leveling off and modest decline in new deliveries across our footprint, which should help markets stay roughly a balance late in the cycle.","So, overall, the macro environment and new supply trends points to a relatively stable near-term outlook for the sector and for our markets, with rent growth settling in the 2% to 3% range, a level below the average so far of the cycle because of the long-term trend.","I'll now turn it over to Sean, who will touch on some of the operating trends we're seeing in our markets.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thanks, Tim. Turning to slide 8. While we've experienced healthy demand this entire cycle, the introduction of elevated levels of supply, which Tim highlighted on the previous slide, has led to several quarters of below-trend rent growth in our markets.","And if you turn to slide 9, in terms of regional performance, the Metro New York, New Jersey and Mid-Atlantic regions continue to be the weakest performers, with effective rent growth that's flat to modestly positive. The Mid-Atlantic continues to be plagued with heavy supply, which is expected to continue through 2019. And then New York, New Jersey region, the city continues to be very weak, but supply is expected to peak late this year and then fall off considerably in 2019.","In Northern California, we continue to see signs of improved performance, particularly in San Jose, where deliveries are expected to be down about 1,500 units this year as compared to 2017. The healthiest region in the portfolio is Southern California, which is currently producing effective rent growth of roughly 4% per year. Given deliveries are expected to decline from the 2% range this year to just above 1% next year, the outlook for Southern California is pretty healthy through 2019.","And turning to the Pacific Northwest, which is our strongest market for the past couple years, the combination of moderating job growth and elevated supply, which is expected to be roughly 4.5% of inventory this year, has resulted in a continued deceleration in effective rent growth. Year-over-year in March, effective rent growth was down to roughly 2% in Seattle.","Turning to slide 10, our same-store portfolio produced 2.4% rental revenue growth in Q1, which consisted of a 2.5% increase in rental rate and 10-basis point decline in occupancy. Our Q1 revenue growth was about 60 basis points above the effective rent growth in our markets and we expect relatively stable rental revenue growth each quarter this year.","Shifting to slide 11, as opposed to the relatively stable trend in same-store rental revenue growth, same-store operating expense growth is expected to be front-loaded this year and pretty choppy from quarter-to-quarter. While Q1 operating expense growth was slightly lower than budget, we expected it to be heavy and driven by three categories.","First, property taxes, which is primarily related to successful property tax appeals in Southern California during Q1 2017, and then increase in assessments and rate in the Pacific Northwest. Second, an increase in onsite wages and benefits costs. In addition to normal merit adjustments, we had more occupied positions in Q1 as compared to last year, which was partially offset by reduced temporary help in repairs and maintenance. Also, the increase in benefit costs was expected to peak on a year-over-year basis in Q1. And then, third, increased insurance premiums and the net change in claims activity, which can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter.","Turning to slide 12 to address development, our Q1 deliveries and the NOI generated from our development portfolio were both pretty much in line with budget. Looking forward, we expect the volume of deliveries in Q2 to be roughly in line with our original plan.","Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin to talk about our funding capacity and the balance sheet. Kevin?","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thanks, Sean. On slide 13, we show how we have reduced development starts to a level that we believe we can fund on a roughly leverage neutral basis through a combination of annual growth in EBITDA leveraged to five times, cash flow from operations and retain capital from disposition activity, and without needing to issue common equity.","Specifically, as you could see on the left-hand side of the slide, our development starts for 2017 and 2018 are expected to average about $900 million per year, about $500 million less than the average start volume of $1.4 billion per year in the preceding four-year period.","On the right-side of the slide, we illustrate how the combination of EBITDA growth leveraged at five times, cash from operations, and dispositions currently enables us to fund a little over $1 billion in development spend and about $200 million of redevelopment spend on a roughly leverage neutral basis.","Thus, by reducing development starts in this way, we reduce our equity funding needs and have tailored our development activities to the current environment. In doing so, we are following an approach we applied in the 1999 to 2007 timeframe when we generally funded the equity need for development by recycling capital through asset sales.","Additionally, on slide 14, and as we've discussed before, another way in which we mitigate risks from development is by substantially match-funding long-term capital with development that is underway. This allows us to lock-in development profit and substantially reduces the amount of remaining capital that is exposed to future changes in our cost of capital.","As you could see on the left-side of the slide, we're approximately 80% match-funded against development underway at the end of the first quarter of 2018, consistent with our objective of being roughly 70% to 80% match-funded against this book of business.","On the right-side of the slide, you can see how we control the land value at risk on the balance sheet by limiting the amount of land that we own for development. Over the past two years, we have kept our land inventory at multi-decade low levels. Of this land held for development, nearly all of it is associated with projects that are expected to start construction within the next six months.","On slide 15, we show several key credit metrics and how they compare to the multi-family sector average as of year-end 2017. As you can see, our credit metrics remain strong and provide AvalonBay with continued financial flexibility. Specifically, at year-end, net debt to core EBITDA was low at 5.0 times, interest coverage was high at 6.9 times, and the weighted average years to maturity on our fixed rate debt remained high at 9.1 years.","Finally, as a result of our balance sheet management efforts over the past few years, we've been able to create a debt maturity schedule that enhances our financial flexibility by significantly reducing the capital needed to refinance existing debt over the next decade. In particular, we have substantially addressed our near-term debt maturities, and by having nearly 30% of our debt mature beyond 2027, average debt maturities over the next decade represent only $550 million per year, which is less than our current amount of dividends and only 2% of our total enterprise value.","With that, I'll turn it back to Tim for concluding remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. Yeah. So, in summary, Q1 was a solid quarter with performance in line with expectations. We expect fundamentals to stabilize over the next two to three years, leading to rent growth we believe in the 2% to 3% range. New development continues to contribute to earnings and NAV growth in a meaningful way.","And then, lastly, I would say a strong balance sheet and credit profile, combined with a disciplined approach in new development, provides us plenty of flexibility to continue to pursue our growth strategy while navigating the latter stages of the current economic expansion.","And with that, Cassie, we'd be glad to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. How is April in the forward renewals trending relative to original expectations, and if you maintained the outperformance that you had in the first quarter?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Nick, it's Sean. In terms of April, we're basically seeing the seasonal trends that we would have expected in terms of the lift in rate. So, to give you some perspective, on Q1 it moved up nicely through the quarter. So, January blended rent change was about 60 basis points. It moved up to about 150 basis points in February, about 210 basis points in March and we're trending right now about 206 basis points in April and seeing steady improvement across the majority of the markets. In terms of renewal offers, renewal offers are going out around 5%.","So I'd say generally where we are as we look at Q2 is basically in line with what we expected across the footprint, there'll still be some variations from market-to-market, and probably the two I'd point to are the Mid-Atlantic and Pacific Northwest being a little bit softer than we would have anticipated. And the others are either flat to slightly up as compared to what we anticipated. So, net-net, it's in the range.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And then just wondered if there's any progress or updates on the expansion into Denver and Southeast Florida.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure. Hey, Nick. It's Matt. We are continuing to look hard at those markets and there are assets for sale. We don't have anything under contract at this point, but we're making offers and we're also talking to some folks who have deals ready to go, where we might be able to provide capital in some kind of a structure type transaction. So, yeah, hopefully, we'll have more to report on that later in the year, but as of right now, nothing new.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for the time. Just on the same-store revenue trends where you're expecting it generally flat, is there any sort of level of conservatism or downside built into that? Because your previous expectation was for a modest uptick in the second and third quarter, and I would think you have a higher kind of earning now from the rents, deals you struck in the order. So, just curious about how we should be thinking about same-store revenue over the course of the year and what's built into that upside or downside?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Juan. This is Sean. I mean, we only provide guidance, which we did back in January. We sort of called it bull's eye, as you might say. So I wouldn't say there's necessarily conservatism built in. It's what we expected for the year. And in terms of any shift in that, we'll address that certainly mid-year when we complete a full reforecast when we're sure about probably half of the leasing season and that's the best time to provide an update.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hey, Juan. This is Tim. Maybe just to add to that a little bit. Same-store revenue I think we projected pretty flat, but historically what we see is there is a seasonal variation in terms of rent change, which is different obviously than same-store revenue growth. So, as Sean mentioned, we are seeing the normal seasonal lift in light-term rent change, but that was anticipated in the budget.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And just a quick one for me. If you could go through the new and renewal rates for the first quarter leasing across your major geographic areas, not the MSAs, if you wouldn't mind?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Juan, why don't we take that to you offline. That's a fair amount of data, three data points across six markets, that's a fair amount. So why don't we take that offline and we'll get that to you.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","And, Juan, you probably did see, we did add this quarter the blended rent change by the six regions in total. So we can break those out between new movements and renewals offline for you.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And then just, while I have the floor, on Washington, D.C., what are you seeing there? Is that market do you think continuing to decelerate or do you think we're troughing here? What are your expectations going forward? Has there been any strengthening in the job market with higher defense spending or any anecdotes you could share?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Juan. This is Sean again. I mean nothing material to report other than D.C. is performing as I indicated. The D.C. metro area, which includes the district, suburban Virginia and suburban Maryland \u2013 or Northern Virginia I should say. Slightly weaker than expected. I'd say the district is weak and we expected it to be weak based on the volume of supply being delivered in the district, which is heavier than what you're seeing in either Northern Virginia or in suburban Maryland, as a percentage of stock.","So I'm not sure we're going to see anything different as we move through their prime leasing season, unless we start to see a material change in job growth in the district itself and are bleeding out into some of the outer suburbs. But for D.C. this year, we're talking about deliveries that are north of 5% of inventory, about the same level in 2019, it's about 6,000 units a year. It's concentrated in certain pockets, but unless we see a meaningful uptick in job growth, I don't think we're going to see improved performance in D.C. It's going to continue to be pretty weak.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Just want to go back to the quarterly breakdown of the operating expenses, which obviously you've put some pretty good detail in here. Is that really just driven by sort of year-over-year comparisons and maybe timing of some R&M spend? I was just curious if you could provide some color on that trajectory.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Vincent, it's Sean. Yeah. I mean, first, as we indicated in the slide and in my prepared remarks, we expected Q1 expense growth to be elevated. It actually came in lower than we anticipated. But the main drivers, as indicated, are really the tough comp and property taxes, given very successful appeals in Southern and Northern California, but particularly Southern California in Q1 of 2017 created a pretty tough comp there.","Utilities, we've had some pretty good winters the last couple of years in 2016, 2017. Obviously, it was a pretty extended cold winter this year. We had expected a more normal winter and budgeted accordingly, but that reflected an increase in utilities. And then certainly we expected the increases in insurance based on what we knew our premiums are going to be and volatility and claims activity, and then I mentioned the payroll.","So I'd say, in terms of the drivers, it's the same things that I mentioned, the taxes, the payroll piece, utilities, insurance, and expected Q1 to be high and then start to level off as we move through the year.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Yeah. I think the question was more on the future quarters just being so much lower than the first quarter and what's really causing the big decline, particularly in the third and fourth quarters?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, some of the things that I mentioned, so on property taxes we had significant appeals that hit the books in Q1 of 2017, so it was just a comp issue. That's not going to be a recurring issue in terms of each of the quarters of 2018, given those appeals were booked in Q1 of 2017 that created heavy pressure in this quarter.","On payroll, as an example, we expected Q1 to be the peak for benefits. It's up about 15% year-over-year in Q1, but then it levels off as you move through the year. So, without going through every single category there are a number of topics like that that we're peaking in Q1 that will not recur in subsequent quarters that will take the year-over-year growth rate for all of OpEx down.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","And so, Sean, like for benefits, it actually goes down below average like as we get into Q3 and Q4, so payroll actually comes down below sort of an average run rate.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Correct.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","So I think there's some of that happening, Vincent, where there's little bit of leveling off of the impact as you move through the year.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. All right. Thanks. And just maybe one more just in terms of Manhattan and New York in general, which was said as pretty tough still. Can you just comment on concession trends there?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. As it relates to concessions, I mean, typically what you'd find in New York is heavy concessions on lease-ups, given the rent stabilization there and everybody trying to get the highest legal rent possible. In terms of concessions in our portfolio, and we're pretty consistent with most operators that are operating stabilized assets, we don't use a lot of concessions. I mean, average dollar concession per move in across the New York metro area for us is $40 in Q1. So it's pretty immaterial. Everybody pretty much prices on an effective rent basis as opposed to using concessions and lease-ups. So, that's not unusual.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","And we'll go next to Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Sorry. I'm looking at the development rights pipeline on page 15 of the supplemental. Can you remind us of the history there of how the different concentrations in the regions came together. How much of that was attributable to Archstone and then other transactions since then? Just how that all came together and what the strategic perspective there is?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure. Rich, it's Matt. At this point, the development rights pipeline is, I don't think there are any Archstone development rights left in there at this point. We had added a few back in early 2013 when we closed that transaction, but we've moved most of those through the pipeline.","There are a couple of deals that were Archstone assets we acquired where we have identified an opportunity to add density down the road. And so those are in there as development rights. Those are not conventional development rights in the sense that it's not land. We're buying from a third party on any kind of fixed timeframe. So we think those are great deals.","These are jurisdictions in Mountain View and San Jose that understand the need for more housing, and so are supportive of us adding density, as long as we're not taking that in the existing assets. So there's a little bit of that, but it's honestly mostly bottom-up and these are mostly kind of one-off deals that our local teams have sourced. And they kind of go through a series of screens here in terms of the economics and the risk relative to the value creation. So you see it.","It does tend to be concentrated a little more heavily in the New York region, part of that's because we have multiple offices there. So we have a lot of bodies and it does play to some of our competitive advantages in the suburbs, if you look in places like New Jersey and Long Island that are highly supply-constrained where we have the ability to get entitlements, so those tend to be very accretive deals. But there isn't necessarily any particular top-down driver of that.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Rich, maybe just to add to that, as Matt mentioned, at this point in the cycle, we normally would see a higher concentration in Northeast, so it just tends to be more stable and deals tend to underwrite kind of throughout the cycle. In California, we probably have more than we normally would expect to have at this point in the cycle, but as Matt mentioned, they're not really sort of normal kind of market rate land deals and some cases are intensifying existing assets.","So I think there's three public-private deals which are negotiated type deals and there's probably at least one other that's kind of more of a venture deal that's on a negotiated basis. So, obviously, those markets been more volatile in past. You got to be much more sensitive to market timing from a development standpoint and, if anything, it's probably a little higher than normal but for the reasons I mentioned.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","All right. I appreciate the perspective there, guys. My second question here concerns Northern California. It seems like there's a \u2013 I don't want to call it an inflection point maybe, but an uptick maybe a little bit better than at least we were expecting as of a few months ago, just in terms of rent trends across the board.","I know you've highlighted San Jose specifically with supply falling. But how quickly can that market change over the course of this year? And then how do you think about maybe some offsetting sort of elements where you've got VC funding in the area is up year-over-year, but you've got mature tech, which in some pockets is suffering. How do you think about the impact there on job growth and just the forward outlook?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Rich, it's Sean. I mean it's good question, probably not one that's, yeah, easy to answer. It's kind of a mixed bag of things there. But I mean there are specific pockets where given supply is abating that's certainly helping. And in a market like Northern California, you're still seeing pretty solid income growth.","So even though job growth may not be as healthy as it was over the past couple of years, the jobs that are being created for the most part, particularly in the tech and information systems categories that you can go through, wage growth there is very strong. So it does support plenty of rent growth possibilities, let's just say.","So to the extent that you see a less competitive environment from supply, things can move relatively quickly in that market. We've seen it both to the up and down over the course of this cycle. So I'm not expecting it to accelerate to what it was maybe two or three years ago, just given the volume of supply that remains in that market, but it's probably healthier than it was as you were at the end of 2016, 2017, going into 2017, where you sort of had floodgate open in terms of new supply and the impact that it started to have on rent growth and stabilized assets.","So, Tim, do you have any thoughts on that?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Rich. Essentially, if you look over the last six months, the strongest job growth has been in the technology market, Northern California, Seattle and Denver. And essentially, when you look at what's happening on the office absorption side, the tech markets real-time are outperforming as well. I mean, you're probably seeing that from some of the public companies that are releasing earnings lately.","So, at least in terms from a corporate standpoint, it seems like there's probably more confidence and more optimism of taking down space or hiring. So that won't flip necessarily overnight, but as Sean mentioned they are pretty volatile markets and can be a function sometimes what's happening in the Nasdaq. Sort of the capital punchbowl sometimes gets taken away quickly from upstart companies in these markets. But, right now, there's still the strongest demand that we're seeing.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","All right. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll go next to Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Just want to touch a little on construction costs as we continue to hear about them increasing. So I'm curious, one, what have you seen with costs over the last three to six months and do you expect going forward? Two, how does it impact I guess your thoughts on new starts maybe by even region or submarket? And then, third, what are the broader implications for supply as you look out over the next couple of years.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, Austin. This is Matt. As Tim mentioned in his opening remarks, hard costs are certainly growing faster than rents in all of our markets at this point. And so it is having an impact. What we're finding that is one reason. We're finding that kind of the things at the lower density suburban product is the stuff that's still underwriting better.","And if you look at our starts this year, what we're planning, three of them are wood-frame garden deals. And while there is cost pressure there, it's maybe not as severe, and we do a lot of that business and we're able to bundle our buying power. And so those numbers have still been able to underwrite, tend to be in sub-markets with less supply in the first place, which also helps.","Four of our planned eight starts this year are mid-rise kind of wrap deals, above-grade parking with wood-frame, and that's costs there are probably growing 4%, 5%, 6%, maybe a little more still in California and Seattle. And consequently, that's where less of our pipeline is because those deals are just having a harder time underwriting. And then we have maybe one high-rise we might start this year but in Baltimore, which is not a market that's seen the kind of cost pressures.","A lot of it is still \u2013 I mean you see a lot of stuff about commodities and certainly steel and lumber tariffs don't help, but ultimately the main driver is labor availability and subcontractor margins. And in most of these markets, the subcontractors are still as busy as they want to be. So, for them to return the call, it's going to cost you.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. So, maybe just to add to Matt. I think it's probably in the 6% to 7% range, but it's probably a range from 3% or 4% on the low end to, on a year-over-year basis over the last three to six months, to high-single-digit probably around 9% on the West Coast.","The urban stuff, New York is tough to underwrite, the Bay Area is tough, and it's one of the reasons we haven't put new land under contract there really for the last three years. It's all been either public-private type stuff or densification opportunities.","But I think it could last for a little while. As Matt said, it's a skilled labor issue. When you're kind of late in the cycle, we tend to have these commodity booms as we get late in the cycle and it's happening globally right now as we're seeing kind of mature economies growing basically the rate we are at 3%. I think our expectation has to be over the next year or two the construction costs are going to continue to outpace rent growth. So it's going to continue to, we think, regulate supply.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right. So, as I said, so ultimately you think supply comes down versus return expectations start to come down?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","In my prepared remarks, I said modestly, it's been flat in our markets over the last three or four months. Yeah, essentially, when you look at the public guys, our expectations are for supply to come down as it relates to our business line. It's hard to know with the merchant holders. Ultimately it's going to turn on capital. And capital is probably a little more free right now than it was six months ago, but that can't change, that can't change.","As we mentioned in some other calls, there have been some banks that have sort of red line multi-family, but on the other hand there have been sort of non-bank lenders that have seemed to materialize to fill the void. And sort of how long they kind of keep the party going I think is going to be the test.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","We'll go next to Drew Babin with Baird.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon. First question, going through the development page in the supplemental, it looks like not a lot changed in terms of timing on most of the projects. But I did notice that Avalon public market at Emeryville was delayed one quarter in terms of first occupancy as well as stabilization. I was just wondering if that's anything that might tangibly impact earnings or whether that's just a matter of a few weeks, or if you could give some color on that, that'd be helpful?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, Drew. It's Matt. On average, we're kind of where we expected to be. That one deal, which was not really expected to open until relatively late in here at any rate, we did push back the initial occupancy I think from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So we weren't planning a lot of occupancy there at any rate this year.","But you may have noticed also several of the other deals that are finishing this year, we actually pulled forward the completion date. So we will wind up getting a few more apartments than we expected in the second quarter, third quarter. So we think that probably offsets any of the earnings impact of that deal and generally, as Sean mentioned, things are tracking as we expected on average.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's good to know. And I guess a more general question. You talk about an improving employment situation and better wage growth nationally. I guess, my question is, are you seeing the same kind of impact from your suburban markets that you're seeing in some of the urban centers where you maybe get some of your higher barrier-to-entry suburban markets, where some of that demand kind of gets squeezed through and really causes some good rent growth? I was just wondering if you had any case studies or examples of where that might be happening.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Drew, just to make sure I understand the nature of the question in terms of relative performance, the spread between suburban and urban is still relatively wide. If you look at effective rent growth year-over-year, if you look at it for actually metrics, as an example, the spread is about 180 basis points right now, where suburban assets are outperforming urban.","But every market is a little bit different and it depends on whether you're at a high price point in a suburban environment versus a more moderate price point, and the same thing in the urban environment. So those spreads do change from market-to-market, and depending on how you're positioning the asset.","But in general, across our footprint, suburban assets continue to outperform relative to urban assets, which is mainly a function of two things. One, just absolute price point being cheaper in the suburbs, but then two, is the volume of deliveries in the urban end markets are roughly twice the volume of the suburban environment in our markets at this point. So...","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Drew, I'd just add to that. One place, we are seeing it, as Sean mentioned, we're certainly seeing it in our stabilized portfolio. On the lease-ups, that's probably where we're also seeing it. On average, the lease-ups are running about $20 ahead of pro form on rent compared to what we underwrote. But if you double click through that, they're running probably ahead in the suburban assets and maybe a little behind in the urban assets.","So, that's where we're seeing some of these suburban assets. And some bonds that we completed recently like Great Neck, which we completed last year, or Rockville Center Phase II, where we did quite a bit better than we anticipated. So, that's maybe where we're seeing it more.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you. That's all for me.","Operator","And we'll go next to Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey guys. Quick question for me. Look, I'm sort of thinking back on your foray into the Denver market a couple months ago, and I'm wondering if there's any markets that you're not in right now where you're seeing sufficient migrations to those markets where maybe the development yields are a little bit more creative. So, said another way, are there any markets that you're keeping your eye on that maybe you're not in right now or are you comfortable with where you are in the so-called late cycle?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hey, Rich. Tim here. I'd say we're comfortable with where we're at with the addition of those markets. That doesn't mean that there aren't other markets, particularly in the Sunbelt, where development isn't accretive. But one of the things we struggle with in some of those markets though is, can we gain sort of a competitive advantage relatively quickly and sort of leverage some of our key sort of core competencies.","And it's harder to make that argument certainly in Dallas and Atlanta where there's a lot of really super talented merchant builders in those markets and even a REIT or two that we can go in there and create sort of a winning position, where we felt like we have that opportunity potentially in Denver and Southeast Florida for a number of different reasons but...","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","But we feel pretty good with where we're at right now in terms of the revised footprint.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Got it. That's helpful. That's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.","John Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC","Thanks. Matt, of the $1.2 billion in capital costs yet to be spent on the current pipeline, how much of this cost is exposed to rising construction expenses versus what's been locked-in?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Really almost none of it. When we started deal and we have what we call a Class 3 budget, at that point we've already bought out probably between 60% and 70% of the major trades. And then, the remaining piece generally gets bought out in the first 90 to 120 days of the deal. So the reality of it is everything that's under development, it's on that schedule. It's already basically bought out now.","Occasionally, you may have a situation where a subcontractor can't perform at that number because they didn't understand their labor cost structure or whatever and they may go under and then we may have to replace them and we have contingencies for that. But our history has been pretty impressive over a long period of time on our ability to deliver on budget. So we don't really view that as where the risk is. The risk is probably more in the deals that we have not yet started and whether they will actually \u2013 when we go to start them, where the costs will be, where we think they are today.","John Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC","Okay. Makes sense. Second question is around Costa-Hawkins, Tim. I know it's nearly impossible to underwrite what the impact is going to be. And if it does even a repeal passes, nothing may change on the ground overnight.","But from a portfolio management perspective, I guess as a REIT, how do you manage the risk of Costa-Hawkins over the next couple of years in terms of your California concentration and long-term growth you'd underwrite in California?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes. John, it's Sean. Maybe I'll make a couple of comments and then, yeah, Tim can certainly chime in. But as you indicated, given the nature of the issue, which is basically repealing something that limits the ability of local jurisdiction to enact rent control, doesn't necessarily tell you what will actually happen. So it's very difficult to predict.","From a portfolio standpoint, what I'd say is we certainly know which jurisdictions could be more likely to enact rent control on post-1995 buildings, given their sort of public policy efforts to-date in this land, so the councils and all the other things that we know about all the local jurisdictions. Whether that actually happens or not, who knows, you can make bets jurisdiction by jurisdiction.","So, to the extent that we're thinking about our portfolio, to the extent this was repealed, we certainly would be thinking about those jurisdictions first in terms of what our exposure might be. I'd say most of those are in Northern California as opposed to Southern California. There are a few in Southern California that you'd probably be watching.","But there's also other things that you might consider doing in terms of what it might do to the housing shortage that already exists. It's only going to make it worse to the extent that rent control is enacted. You may be looking at some of those deals that you have maps on and converting some of them to condos in some of those jurisdictions we think the risk is high and\/or other potential opportunities.","So we'll see where it goes. There's a lot more to come on this topic. But I mean there's no question that rent control has proven to be bad public policy where it's been adopted. And in this case, our expectations only would exacerbate the housing shortage in California to the extent Costa-Hawkins was repealed and rent control was adopted fairly widespread across the state. We don't think that's likely in terms of widespread adoption, but it's something we certainly want to be mindful of in terms of strategy.","But, Tim, I don't know if you have...","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. And John, it also is a function, as you know, what form is it adopted in. I mean, to the extent it has a vacancy decontrol feature, that's not as harmful. And in fact, you might argue that it could enhance the value of the asset depending upon whether it chills (43:08) new construction. Certainly, we've seen that in some of the submarkets we do business in, whether it's San Francisco or Santa Monica or some others.","But, I guess I'd also say, I mean, it is a risk of our markets. I mean, we are in sort of the high cost of living blue states where every once in a while these things are going to rear their head. And no matter how well intended they are, as Sean mentioned, they are bad public policy and hope sort of the outcomes of that ultimately sort of get sort of course-corrected over time, because ultimately these economies need good market rate rental housing in order to continue to serve the kind of talent that they need to continue to grow. And if it's a contracting economy, that's probably worse than a growing economy with higher cost of housing, so.","John Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC","Yeah. That all makes plenty of sense. Thanks for that. Then, in short, if the repeal does pass, do you think it's likely that you'd take your 40% of NOI concentration in California much lower?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Way too early to say on that. Again, for the reasons I mentioned, again if we think the form is going to have some notion of vacancy decontrol passed by local jurisdiction, that's very different than something where it's a real taking value, which may impact a lot of our portfolio decision, including converting some to condominium, as Sean mentioned, a lot of our portfolio is mapped in California. So we do have some flexibility and some options. So, that alone, to the extent we started that would probably take down our concentration.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. And John, keep in mind, I think where I think you'd be most concerned in terms of the enactment of rent control is probably Northern California, given the activity in the last several years as compared to Southern California, there are a couple of places in Southern California that are kind of hotspots you'd have to watch, particularly in the L.A. market side.","But we're probably dealing really with half of that 40% in our case, more like 20% you'd be concerned about the specific jurisdictions where it could be problematic. But it very likely could result in just fewer deliveries overall. So it could be very attractive. I mean, if you look at what's happened already just in response to JJJ in LA, the volume of applications is down pretty dramatically and people can't seem to get anything done in LA right now as a result of it.","John Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC","Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman & Associates","Hi. Thank you, guys. Appreciate the supply outlook that you provided on slide 7 on the amount of work that you guys do to get there. If I look at the 2018 bars, they seem to be accelerating both in absolute terms as well as the year-over-year pressure versus 2017. And I don't know if that's splitting it too closely, but seeing that type of trajectory and then same-store revenue being roughly stable through the year. Can you just maybe connect the two and if you think there's something else that's going to be offsetting the supply to hold growth where it is?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Dennis, maybe I'll start and others can chime in. I think it's a fair point you're making. I think our guess is some of the Q3, Q4 will get delayed into 2019, and probably why I said in my prepared remarks sort of really leveling off and maybe a modest decline in 2019.","Our expectation is that they are basically I think around 2.3% additional supply in 2018 and 1.8% in 2019. But we suspect that that will continue to sort of shift out and level off as we've seen over the last the last couple of years. But these are our best estimates based upon what we know today.","But, as we mentioned in past, you saw last year with us we had more delays I think than we've had in the history of the company and a lot just comes down to, as Matt mentioned, just the availability of skilled labor, subcontractors defaulting on their obligations at a rate more than they have in the past.","So I think that explains it in part. But we're also seeing stronger wage growth. So, while job growth may be relatively level, wage growth is stronger. That just provides more wallet share for housing. And then, lastly on top of that, we think household formation is growing faster than new construction, if you look at the total housing market, which has some ancillary benefit to the rental sector.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. That makes sense. And to the degree some of that gets kicked into 2019 and call 2019 sort of flattish to down a little bit, which markets would sit most extreme versus that up or down?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Dennis, this is Sean. I'll provide a little bit of color on that and maybe expand on what Tim said. In terms of our footprint, 2017 deliveries were 2.1% of inventory. 2018, as Tim said, is projected to be 2.3%, but given delays and such, it's probably going to end up being about the same as 2017.","And what really matters in terms of revenue performance is where that supply is concentrated. So it helps for us, as an example, on 2018 supply is actually down about 100 basis points in the New England market as compared to 2017, even though it might be up heavily in Seattle, which is only 5% to 6% of our portfolio. So the mix of it matters quite a bit. In terms of our overall projections, we have projected rent change to be down about 20 basis points relative to 2017 levels for the full-year 2018. So there is some deceleration in there, but market mix certainly helps us.","When you look forward to 2019, to give you some sense of the expected change based on what we know today, the markets that would have the most material reduction in deliveries are in the New York, New Jersey region, including the city, which is expected to decline from around 13,000 units being delivered this year to about 6,700 next year, and Northern New Jersey, which goes from about 9,000 to about 7,000 deliveries.","And then in Southern California, where we're talking about roughly 2% of inventory being delivered this year, it drops down to about 1.25% in 2019, which is spread across all three major markets in Southern California. LA goes from 14,000 to 10,000 deliveries, Orange County from 6,000 to 3,000 deliveries, San Diego from 5,000 to 3,000 deliveries, so it's pretty widespread in Southern California. Those are the two markets where you see the most material reduction in deliveries.","New England is down 30 basis points. And then the only region that you still remain concerned about, really two regions of the Mid-Atlantic and the Pacific Northwest, which are still going to be in absolute numbers pretty high in 2019, about 2.7% in Mid-Atlantic and still roughly 4% in the Pacific Northwest. The other markets are starting to look better. Those two will continue to have some challenges through 2019 in terms of deliveries though.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman & Associates","Very helpful. Thanks. And then just one last one on DC. You mentioned that's another area in the Mid-Atlantic in general that's going to be elevated again next year, and yet that's a market that's just had low growth for quite some time. So what's your perspective on why the supply keeps coming there, even though the fundamentals have been softer than other areas? Construction cost is I'm sure an issue there like elsewhere, capital probably similar as elsewhere. What's causing that to drag on so long?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Dennis, it's simply there's been a lot of profit to be a multi-family builder and it continues. I mean the deal we completed this quarter, NoMa a good example of that, it's been one of our better lease-ups. But we built that for about $340 a door, $350 a door, and it's probably worth north of $500 a door. So, merchant builders continue to make money. It's been a good trading market. Cap rates continue to be in the 4s. We have an asset on the market right now, a 12-, 15-year-old asset, Matt, where it's got probably as much interest as any asset that we're selling this year.","So it's been a good trading market. And if you talk to the office guys, they'll say exactly the same thing. Tough fundamentals but, boy, there's still value there on the trade.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll go to Alexandra (sic) [Alexander] Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just two quick ones for me. First, obviously, appreciate the comments on what's going on in California. Can you just talk about your thoughts, Tim, on New York with rent control, clearly the Senate fight here, a lot of it was to try and rally and change the rent control laws here in New York. So can you just give your view and if this affects newer construction or this is really only for the sort of legacy buildings that already have rent control as part of it?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Alex, that's a good question and probably a long-winded answer. Why don't we try to call you offline on that one in terms of the nuances associated with that because it's a pretty nuanced issue, if that's all right with you?","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. That works. And then the second question is, you talked about elevated supply for the next several years and, obviously, in the pipeline your development yields have come down as costs have gone up, et cetera. Just based on where your yield you're delivering in the sort of high-5s and you're trading in the sort of mid implied 5% cap range.","Do you guys think about reducing the pipeline even more? You've already scaled it back about a third. Do you think about scaling it back even more, just based on your comments that you expect elevated supply for the next two to three years?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Alex, it's Tim. We might. It's hopefully going to turn on the economics of those deals as they get prepared for starts. But maybe just to put a little bit more numbers on it, I mean we're delivering today call it in the 6% to 6.5% range and I would tell you those assets are probably worth in the probably no higher than a 4.5% cap what we're delivering versus we're probably trading in the 5.5% range on a portfolio that maybe is more like a 4.75% kind of portfolio.","So, today, it makes sense to do some development, but not as much as we've done in the past. And as Kevin mentioned, it's down 30%, 40% from kind of the 2013 to 2016 peak. But to the extent we continue to see more deterioration both in the yields and potentially in our stock price, you start to have different kind of capital allocation options that become more attractive.","So I think it's certainly \u2013 that's potential that the $900 million could become $700 million or $600 million, depending upon which deals still make sense as cost of capital and market conditions in year one. (54:44)","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thank you, Tim.","Operator","Okay. And we'll go next to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Yes. Just one quick one for me. Are you seeing any differences in behavior around tenants looking at your AVA, eaves, and AvalonBay assets? Just in regards to sensitivity to rent increases, so how aggressively they're looking for concessions when they're thinking of moving in?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. And D.C. specifically you're talking about, Tayo?","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Not in D.C., just kind of across all the markets, if you're just kind of seeing anything really different across the three product types with regard to consumer behavior?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I would say, by product type, it's more a function of the local dynamics of supply and demand in that environment and how strained people might be. In terms of if you look at rent to income ratios and things like that, they're not all that different. To be honest, this is across the markets and the brands.","It's really a function of what's happening in that local environment and how quickly rents are growing relative to incomes. And right now, we've seen pretty good growth in incomes across all segments if you want to describe it that way. And so, so far, I mean no material difference across the brands.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Got you. What about specifically in oversupplied markets?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","I'm sorry. Say it again.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","What about specifically in oversupplied markets, as you were insinuating before anything different...","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Not necessarily pressure from I can't afford that. I think that's sort of a constant across the brands. It's more a function of what can they get down the street. So, if there's plenty of supply, in the submarket, if we happen to have a high-end asset in that submarket, we certainly need to be very thoughtful about how we handle renewal offers and pricing in a very competitive environment as compared to one where it's not quite as competitive. So, that certainly comes into play. It's still less competitive in the suburban environment, as I mentioned earlier, relative to the urban submarkets, but that's really what it comes down to.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Got you. All right. Thank you.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time.

The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com\/earnings and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities for his remarks. Tim?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q2 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Sean, Kevin, and I will provide a brief commentary on the slides that we posted last night and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. Our comments will focus on providing first, an overview of results for the quarter. Secondly, an update to our outlook for the full year; and then, lastly, we want to touch on how we're managing risk at this point in the cycle.","Starting on slide 4, highlights for the quarter include core FFO growth of 6.7% or $0.04 per share above the midpoint of our Q2 outlook. Same-store revenue growth came in at 2.5%, which was about 20 basis points higher than budget for the quarter and roughly 30 bps above budget year-to-date. We completed $140 million in new development at an average initial projected yield of 6.4% and so far this year completed $430 million at a projected yield of 6.5%. And then, lastly, we raised about $300 million of external capital through the sale four communities at an average cap rate of 4.7% as the transaction market continues to be very healthy.","Turning now to slide 5 and touching on our outlook update for the full year, core FFO growth is now projected at 4.1% or 50 basis points above our original outlook. Same-store revenue and NOI growth are expected to come in at 2.4% and 2.3% respectively, both up by about 30 basis points from our original outlook. Expected NOI from development is unchanged at $52 million as deliveries, occupancies, and rates are all largely consistent with plan.","Projected development starts for the year, still tracking our plan of roughly $900 million. And then, lastly, planned external funding for the year is now $950 million. We're about $300 million less than originally expected, mainly due to reduced development spend at some new developments that started or expected to start a little later in the year than we had originally planned.","Turning now to slide 6. Slide 6 provides a breakdown of our revision to core FFO of $0.04 in the revised outlook. As you can see, higher than expected stabilized community NOI from same-store and redevelopment is driving the upward revision with virtually all of that coming from stronger-than-expected revenue growth. Minor revisions to our capital plan and updated overhead projections more or less offset one another for the balance of the revisions to our forecast.","Turning now to slide 7. What's driving this upward revision? It's really coming from stronger-than-expected economic and job growth. And if you look at it nationally, job growth is expected to be about 400,000 jobs or about 20% higher than initial forecast that was embedded in our original outlook. And about 150,000 jobs or about 30% higher than originally anticipated in our markets, which are even stronger.","On the supply side, if you look at projected deliveries in our markets, we now expect to be off by about 5% from what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. And so that the operating performance is really being driven by stronger-than-expected fundamentals on both the demand and supply side.","I'm now going to turn it over to Sean to provide a little bit more color on portfolio performance across our markets. Sean?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thanks, Tim. Turning to slide 8, as Tim mentioned earlier, we increased the midpoint of our same-store revenue growth outlook by 30 basis points to 2.4%. This outperformance is supported by our outlook for stronger growth in New England and Northern California which represents about 35% of our portfolio; and is being partially offset by weaker performance in Seattle, which only represents about 5% of assets.","For New England, it's benefiting from better than expected performance in the Boston market, job growth which has been running at an annualized rate of 1.6% over the past six months. A reduced level of supply resulted in fairly positive momentum thus far this year. At the portfolio level, reduced turnover which is down more than 400 basis points in Q2 alone has allowed us to maintain roughly 96% occupancy as we push rental rates.","We achieved 3.8% rent change from our primarily suburban portfolio during Q2 and are trending above 4% for July. In Northern California, better-than-expected job growth, strong wage growth and overall confidence in the tech sector has led to increased demand in both San Jose and San Francisco. Job growth has accelerated to an annualized pace of 2% in San Francisco and 3% in San Jose over the past six months.","This healthy level of demand combined with moderating supply has resulted in better pricing power over the past quarter. Many of our year-over-year key performance metrics for San Jose and San Francisco improved materially during Q2. Turnover decreased more than 700 basis points in San Jose and 900 basis points in San Francisco. Occupancy increased 60 basis points in San Jose and 80 basis points in San Francisco. For the quarter, occupancy averaged roughly 97% in each market. The median household income of new residents was up 7.5% compared to Q2 last year. And rent change averaged 4.7% in San Jose and 4.6% in San Francisco, up 160 basis points and 350 basis points, respectively compared to Q2 last year. When you look at July, rent change is trending above 5% in both markets.","Moving to the Pacific Northwest, performance is moderated as new supply, which has had a cyclical (07:58) of inventory comes online. Job growth remains strong, but is also slowed from the blistering pace of a couple years ago. Rent change in our portfolio averaged 3% in Q2, about 400 basis points below what we achieved in Q2 2017.","In terms of portfolio revenue growth, year-to-date results have also been impacted by activity, including lease terminations associated with our retail portfolio in the region. On a year-to-date basis, our 3% same-store revenue growth rate represents 3.5% revenue growth from the residential portfolio and a roughly 15% reduction in the revenue generated from the retail portfolio. The performance in our New York, New Jersey, Mid-Atlantic, and Southern California regions is expected to be relatively consistent with our original outlook.","Moving to slide 9. The healthy demand we've experienced over the past year, combined with the leveling-off of supply, has resulted in relatively stable rent change at the portfolio level. This slide depicts the trailing four-quarter average rent change to eliminate the effect of seasonal patterns in our business. We've averaged roughly 2% since Q2 last year, which has supported revenue growth in the low to mid-2% range the last four quarters.","In terms of recent activity, blended rent change for July is currently 3.25%, about 50 basis points greater than what we achieved in July 2017. This is the first month the portfolio has produced a material year-over-year increase in rent change since October 2015. Renewal offers for August and September are running in the high 5% range, about 25 basis points greater than the offers made at the same time last year.","Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin to talk about development in the balance sheet. Kevin?","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thanks, Sean. Turning to slide 10. As the business cycle has matured, we have focused on reducing development risk while further enhancing our credit profile. As you can see on slide 10, we have reduced development starts for 2017 and 2018 to about $900 million per year. This is $500 million or 35% lower than the average start volume of $1.4 billion per year in the preceding four-year period. At this reduced level, new development starts can be funded on a roughly leverage neutral basis through a combination of internal free cash flow, leveraged EBITDA growth, and disposition activity.","As shown on slide 11, we focused on increasing timing flexibility within our $3.5 billion development rights pipeline so that we have greater flexibility to adjust new development starts to real estate and capital market conditions. Specifically in the first two bars on the left, about 40% or $1.4 billion of the pipeline represents projects that are likely to start over the next two-and-a-half years.","In the middle bar, about $400 million of potential development activity represents opportunities to densify existing apartment communities on the West Coast and an opportunity with flexible timing in the Mid-Atlantic. These opportunities can proceed as starts when entitlements are complete if they continue to make economic sense at that time or these can be held in inventory for the next cycle at little cost if necessary since there is no third-party land to be purchased.","And about one-third or $1.2 billion represent projects that are likely to start at least a few years from now sometime in the next cycle. Much of this business is public-private partnerships with flexible timing and representing a different risk profile than our typical development right.","It is also worth noting that we are controlling this $3.5 billion development pipeline with a total investment of only $170 million as of quarter-end. This amount consists of approximately $130 million of land held for development, of which we expect to put about $115 million into production by year-end, and $40 million in development pursuit costs.","Altogether, this increased timing flexibility and modest financial exposure reflects the more defensive risk management posture that we adopted several years ago in anticipation of a more challenging development environment.","Turning to slide 12, as we have throughout this cycle, we continue to remain focused on mitigating a key risk of development, which is lagged funding risk by continuing to substantially match-fund development underway with long-term capital.","By doing so, we are able to lock in much of the development profit by substantially reducing the amount of remaining capital that is exposed to future changes in our cost of capital. At the end of the second quarter, we were approximately 85% match-funded against development underway, which is in excess of the high end of our target range of being roughly 70% to 80% match-funded against outstanding development commitments.","On slide 13, we show how we have remained focused on enhancing our balance sheet strength and flexibility by highlighting two important credit metrics, namely overall leverage and refinancing risk. Specifically, at the end of the second quarter, net debt to core EBITDAre remained low at 5.0 times and at the low end of our target range of about 5 to 6 times.","In addition, by issuing longer-dated debt in recent years, we have increased the weighted average years to maturity of our total debt outstanding from 8.3 years to 10.2 years, which is one of the highest in the REIT sector. In doing so, we not only reduced our near-term refinancing risk over the next few years, but also put the company on stronger footing for the long term.","And, with that, I'll turn it back to Tim for concluding remarks.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin. Just finishing up on slide 14 and some of the key takeaways for the quarter. Healthy economic growth is supporting apartment markets with revenue growth now stabilizing in the 2% to 3% range. Our revised outlook is ahead of our original plan, driven by better-than-expected fundamentals. Development deliveries and NOI are in line with our original plan.","As the cycle ages, as Kevin just mentioned, we are increasingly turning our attention to risk management, particularly how we are managing the development portfolio, the balance sheet. And then, lastly, we are currently on pace to deliver better than sector average core FFO growth for the eighth consecutive year.","And, with that, we'd like to open up the call for questions, Travis.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. Our first question comes from Nick Joseph.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Tim, you mentioned risk management, and there have been media reports Avalon exploring a larger New York disposition transaction. What's your appetite for selling or JVing a portfolio of assets?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Nick, Tim. We are aware of some media reports out there. As it relates to the Manhattan portfolio of assets, I mean, we can't really comment on it. I guess, what I'd say is we often do explore either opportunistically or strategically disposition or portfolio-type agreements, either outright sales or JVs, and they are often subject to confidentiality.","And as it relates to that specific deal, we'll \u2013 when it makes sense to comment on anything, we will. But as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, the disposition market is \u2013 the transaction market is very healthy. We sold $300 million this quarter at sub-5% cap rate. Those aren't necessarily the lowest cap rate assets in the portfolio. So, I think, it is \u2013 as you look across kind of our opportunity set for capital, asset sales and debt are easily sort of screen the most attractive to us. So, it's just a matter of what form and we're trying to marry that against \u2013 just against our capital allocation objectives. As you know, we entered Denver and Southeast Florida recently, and are looking, to some extent, to reallocate some capital from the Northeast to those markets, and we've done a fair bit of sales in the suburban New York area as of late and we're looking at other opportunities as well, so.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And then, you've resized or reduced the development pipeline and leverage is at the low end of the targeted range. Should we expect similar levels for the remainder of this cycle or is there anything you're monitoring that make you more aggressive or conservative from here?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Nick. Tim, again. Yeah. Great question. As we mentioned, we have \u2013 as Kevin mentioned, we have brought it down a bit from an average of $1.4 billion in the year and starts about $900 million in the last two years. As many of you know, if you just look at kind of what's happening on the construction side, construction costs have been running in the mid-single digit or probably in the high \u2013 mid- to high-single digit escalation today, whereas rents are more in the 2% to 3% range. And if you just play that out over a couple of years, that could erode yields by, call it, 20 basis points a year. So as a result, I mean, a lot of this is bottom-up at some level. There's fewer deals that are going to make sense and therefore, we're likely to see some \u2013 that volume come down assuming we see the same kind of trends we have been seeing, which are construction costs outpacing rent growth, land markets have not yet adjusted yet. Something else we didn't mention, but we really haven't added the development right so far this year other than the Doral deal that we started in Southeast Florida. So, as you look at our bucket, it's one of the reasons why we want to have flexibility and optionality with our development right portfolio.","If you look at that, that group of opportunities, there's probably one bucket that sort of clear the bar easily that we'll continue forward with and start. There's probably another bucket that maybe is just, it is barely clear in the bar or the hurdle and the third bucket where it's more of a stretch. Where it's more of a stretch, we'll probably hold off or renegotiate or potentially abandon. Where it's clearing the bar \u2013 just clearing the bar, it's probably could be a little bit more of a game time decision.","So, I know it's a long-winded way of saying it kind of depends. There's not a simple answer but I would guess we see the same kind of trends in construction cost. You'll continue to see the total level of development volume sort of continue to drift down from this point forward.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hightower.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","I just want to pick up quickly on \u2013 next question on the Manhattan JV transaction \u2013 potential transaction there. So, maybe you've already answered this question, but as we think about the motivations for doing something like that, is it sort of equal weighted between source of funds for additional development? Is it to reduce your New York City exposure? Is it a mark-to-market on those assets that you think the public markets don't appreciate? Just help us understand some of the thinking behind that from a strategic perspective.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Rich, again, can't comment on anything specifically, but any time we're looking at doing something opportunistically, it's going to be a function of is it a good source of capital first, which disposition generally is an attractive source of capital, certainly more attractive than equity today. It's going to be a function of kind of where we want to allocate capital across our market footprint. And thirdly, based upon how we think about valuation in a particular market versus maybe some other opportunities that we may have to reallocate the capital.","So, those are the kind of things that we're using as a screen to look for opportunities, particularly ones that are maybe a little bit more opportunistic in nature.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's fine. Thanks, Tim. And then my second question here, so I think reducing turnover has been a \u2013 it's been sort of a theme the past couple quarters not just from Avalon, but also from your public competitors. Is there anything structural going on there? Is it asset specific, portfolio specific, market specific?","And then if you think about what a normalized turnover rate might be, I mean, how much of that has impacted OpEx year-to-date, and what do you think sort of a normalized OpEx run rate is given a normalized turnover rate if you can help us think through that?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Rich. This is Sean. In terms of the first part of your question, I mean, turnover is down pretty broadly. I mean, if you look at our footprint on a quarterly basis year-over-year, as well the year-to-date numbers, turnover is down pretty material across all the markets with the exception of the Greater New York\/New Jersey region, which is pretty flat. And the reductions are relatively meaningful, let's say greater than 300 basis points across all those markets that are down.","And when you look at sort of the reasons for turnover, it doesn't really change a lot. I mean, relocation is up a little bit. Rent increase is down a little bit. So, just the overall volume of churn is down. And I think it's probably a function of a number of different factors including certainly what's happening in the single family business in terms of home sales and production and things like that being relatively constrained in part due to the availability of labor, cost of materials and things like that, in terms of actually producing new products as well as just inventory being down in terms of home sales.","So, there's probably a number of different factors in there as it relates to turnover. But if you look at the cost side of it, redec is down which shows up in the maintenance category. But in terms of moving the needle, it's not moving the needle in a material way, I would say. So if you looked at overall OpEx growth, you may be talking about 10 basis points, 15 basis points that might relate to what's happening on turnover and redec and things of that sort.","Probably the more important factor is we're thinking about it more on the occupancy side in terms of, reduced turnover, you don't have the vacant days associated with turning those homes that tends to support a higher occupancy, which is certainly what we experienced in the first half of the year where our outperformance in revenue was to a significant degree due to greater occupancy. So, I'm probably focused more on that side of the P&L as opposed to the OpEx side in terms of a material benefit.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","All right. That's perfect. Thanks, Sean.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Babin.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning. There's a good deal of information in the presentation about employment growth and, obviously, you'd exceeded your expectations so far this year. I was hoping you could talk about whether the improved employment growth outlook is kind of a pass-through of what happened in the first half of the year or better expectations for the second half of the year. And I guess kind of bolting onto that, how has wage growth trended year-to-date relative to your expectations kind of outside of the Bay Area where it's obviously very strong?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I'm happy to talk about that, Drew. This is Sean. In terms of job growth, what I'd say is, across the footprint, the majority of the markets are producing jobs at a greater rate than what we expected. The exceptions are sort of in the Greater New England area. But it's a pretty modest number in terms of softness there in job growth and a little bit in Southern California. But our performance in New York, the Mid-Atlantic, Pacific Northwest, Northern California in terms of jobs has been healthy. And, certainly, we would expect that to bleed through into the second half of the year.","As I mentioned on as it relates to the last question, the first half of the year, we benefited from greater occupancy that has allowed us to push rates a little bit harder, and we expect to benefit from that in the second half and let it bleed through across the footprint. So, if you're looking for the impact, we certainly realize it in terms of occupancy. We're realizing it in terms of rate growth. You'll see more probably on the rate growth side than occupancy in the second half of the year.","As it relates to wage growth across the various markets, we have seen pretty healthy wage growth. I mentioned what's happening in Northern California, but we're seeing across some of the major markets north of 5% wage growth \u2013 not wage growth, but household, median household income of new residents \u2013 relative to new residents that moved in the same period last year. So, if you think about it from that perspective, I think we're somewhat of a proxy for our market and the profile of the customers within our buildings. So, it's been pretty healthy wage growth and has actually driven rent income ratios down close to 20%, whereas they peaked this cycle closer to 22% or so. So, wage growth has been healthy across the portfolio, probably most pronounced in the tech markets, but healthy just about everywhere.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And I guess if you could help kind of marry the comments about economic prosperity in the near term and kind of using the term late cycle and saying that, things have obviously decelerated from where they were a few years ago, but there's pick up in employment. Is that sort of saying that, yes, things are a little better than expectations, but employment growth is likely to kind of return more to trend levels over time? Wage growth is likely to return to trend over time. I guess how do you kind of marry the short term versus the long term in the way you've phrased it?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, I mean if you just listen to economists, I think the general consensus is that the combination of stimulus and the rollback of regulatory requirements is creating a bit of a stimulus effect here that may not be long-lasting. We think it's probably going to last for 2018 and maybe 2019. But in some sense, you may be pulling some demand forward, so I'm not sure that either the economists community or we believe at this point that it's just structural nature that's going to, sort of put us on meaningfully different trajectory sort of longer term, if you will.","But certainly, kind of what's going on in the \u2013 and corporations are just starting to get the benefit of the tax cuts, right?","And they're just \u2013 most companies, they're just starting to enter their planning and capital cycles right now. And so, you would expect to see some of that, some of the impact carry forward to 2019 based upon that alone.","Drew T. Babin - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's all from me. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Just hoping you could comment a little bit on supply. You talked about some slippage in delivery, seeing 5% less deliveries than you expected for 2018 to start the year. But if you could just help us frame your views as you see 2019 now, which markets are up and which are down and how you're thinking about the relative growth in the portfolio as a result of that.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Juan, this is Sean. Happy to take that, and then others can chime in as needed. Yes, as we \u2013 Tim mentioned in his prepared remarks, supply, consistent with the last several years, is beginning to slip a little bit from one year to the next. So, it's in the kind of 5% to 6% range in terms of the deliveries that we anticipated for 2018 that are probably going to be pushed into 2019. And, it's spread across a variety of markets. It's probably most concentrated in Southern California, I'd say, where, based on what we see, upwards of 20%, 25% of the deliveries that were expected this year could be pushed into 2019.","But there's some in Northern California, the Mid-Atlantic, et cetera, so it's sort of everywhere. And I expect that based on what we're seeing in terms of trends in the construction market, that as we get towards year-end, we'll see additional slippage in terms of deliveries.","So, I think that sort of the macro way to think about this is last year deliveries were about 2.2% of inventory. Based on what we know today, for 2018, it's going to be about 2.3%. 2019 is forecast at 2.1%, but I'd say 2018 and 2019 are probably going to be pretty similar in terms of the volume of deliveries and you really have to double click through at the market or the regional level to find where the variations are. And so, as you look at 2019 relative to 2018, in terms of any meaningful changes, yeah, there's three markets where we're likely to see an increase in deliveries and that's in D.C. proper or the District itself, the East Bay and San Jose, all in the order of magnitude of 2,000 to 2,200 units \u2013 additional units in 2019 relative to 2018.","And then the markets with a more meaningful reduction in deliveries currently are expected to be New York City which is pretty meaningful, it's a reduction of about 6,000 units as compared to deliveries that are somewhere in the 12,000 unit range this year. Northern New Jersey, couple thousand units. Baltimore about 2,500 units, which we expect to benefit from given some stuff we have under construction up there. We think that'll be good timing for us. And then in Orange County and San Diego, down about 3,000 units Orange County, about 2,500 units in San Diego. Orange County performance has been a little bit soft this year, so they should benefit that market next year.","So, I mean those are the markets that given the current level of job creation and assume that that bleeds through into 2019, tagging along with some of the things that Tim talked about from a macroeconomic perspective, these markets with changes in supply, you'd expect to see either an uplift or potentially a modest softening all else being equal. So, that's probably how I'd describe that in terms of next year.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then just with regards to your developments, you brought down your uses, you talked about some delays or starts maybe a little bit later than you'd anticipated. It didn't look like any of your completions moved other than maybe Public Market in California. But do you see any risk from your development perspective on delivery delays or slippage given what we've just discussed?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Tim here. No, in fact, our updated outlook basically is aligned with our original budget. So we're basically tracking plan at this point with respect to deliveries, occupancies and rate as it relates to the development portfolio.","Juan C. Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just have a question around the guidance. So, you've beaten the second quarter by $0.04 which was attributed to better par","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure. So, Austin, in terms of identified in terms of our outlook, we're expecting from a core FFO point of view a $0.04 increase in 2018 versus our initial outlook to $8.97 versus $8.93. And as we have in the table in the earnings release, as you double click through that, essentially on a net basis, $0.04 is really coming through the same-store and redevelopment portfolios with essentially of that $0.04 really kind of on a net basis $0.03 coming through from same-store revenue, if you will. And then, the other $0.01 coming through essentially accelerated occupancies in the redevelopment portfolio.","And then, sort of as Tim pointed out at the opening that the adjustments in the capital markets and expectations in the overhead line item is kind of being awash.","In terms of kind of the cadence of that, if you look at the balance of the year, in our implied guidance for core FFO in 3Q and what you might sort of back into for the fourth quarter, much of the sequential uplift in core FFO as you pace through the balance of the year is really going to be driven primarily from same-store NOI, if you will and, to a lesser degree, but still to a positive degree from the lease-up activity and development portfolio.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. And, Austin, as it relates to thinking about how revenue growth bleeds through, as I indicated in the first half of the year, we outperformed our expectations overall in the neighborhood of 25 basis points or so. The majority of that was on the occupancy side, around 20 basis points; the other handful of basis points through rate and other rental revenue.","As we moved through the second half of the year, as I mentioned earlier, we expect more of that performance to come through on the rate side than the occupancy side. We had budgeted to be at a higher level of occupancy in the second half versus the first half. So, that's how we think about seeing the components of performance shift in the same-store basket as we move through the balance of the year.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, does the revised guidance in the back half of the year assume the inflection that you talked about in July and then also for August and September renewals?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate that. And then, previously, in the Mid-Atlantic, you talked about that market was tracking a little bit softer early in the year. We saw an acceleration here. What do you attribute that acceleration to? Is it benefited from better demand or did you see supply get pushed out a bit in that market specifically?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Austin, it's Sean. It is on the demand side, job growth outlook for 2018 based on what we produced in the first half and sort of the expected pace in the second half given some of the macroeconomic things that Tim talked about. We're talking about \u2013 at the beginning of the year, we expect the job growth to be closer to 1.1% \u2013 roughly 1%. Right now, it's tracking at pace. It's probably closer to 1.6%. So, that's pretty meaningful increase.","Supply has not changed materially, I would say, at this point. When you look at the delays in that market, we're talking insignificant number of units. It's like 800 units or so in D.C. that's been pushed out, really nothing in suburban Maryland and Virginia. There's a little bit in Baltimore, but we don't have a big same-store basket there. So, it's primarily on the demand side when you look at the Mid-Atlantic. And I'd say in terms of where we're seeing the best performance right now, is in the Northern Virginia submarket of the three major components of the metro area, so.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the time.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pawlowski.","John Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC","Thanks. Tim, regarding dispositions and doing something more opportunistic, am I interpreting your comments right that if you did do something opportunistic that proceeds will be funneled towards development and acquisitions?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Perhaps. Perhaps. I mean, obviously, it's part of the whole capital allocation process but, it's \u2013 I mean, largely the fund. We don't really have any debt to retire. I could do it. I mean, debt rolling, but it's largely fund development and perhaps, to some extent, redeploy into potentially the \u2013 particularly the expansion markets of Southeast Florida and Denver. Some of that may be in development, by the way, as well as acquisitions.","John Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC","Okay. Curious, the thought process just in terms of deploying capital in a very, very competitive private market. If construction cost keep outpacing rent growth by a wide margin, your cost of equity remains impaired and the private vehicles keep raising more money than God, I mean people are going in Denver and South Florida. My question is, do the odds of you guys doing a special dividend or share repurchases increase in 2019 and 2020, if you're having trouble deploying capital?","Kevin P. O'Shea - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, John. It's Kevin. I mean we understand kind of where you're getting at sort of a hypothetical in the first instance about whether we transact opportunistically. And then another hypothetical in terms of what do we decide at that point in time based on future capital market and real estate conditions about the second choice and how to deploy that capital. That's a lot of speculation for something that hasn't yet happened. I guess to try to be responsive, we do think about all those questions.","So, if cash shows up in hand and there's not an immediate compelling use, then certainly, issues such as a special dividend, buyback all get part of the management discussion. But as we talked about before, there are a number of different hurdles and complicating factors that relate to each of those things particularly as a tax-paying entity with obligations to make a dividend over time. So it's premature for us to try to answer that question in a concrete way or to kind of lay out the specificity what the framework would be, but we certainly look at all those things under the circumstances should they arise.","John Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kim.","John Piljung Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. On your development rights, slide 11 of your presentation, you have a bar of $400 million, which includes asset densification in the West Coast. I'm assuming that includes your joint venture with GGP in Seattle, but I was wondering if there were any other retail developments as part of this figure, and how many joint ventures you may have on densification effort?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, John. It's Matt. I can speak to that one. Actually, no, the potential joint venture with GGP in Seattle is not currently in our development rights pipeline. We don't technically recognize a development right until it's cleared due diligence and cleared our investment community for kind of the initial screening. So, we've been working on that for a long time, and it is what I'd call a likely future development right, but that's not in there.","So, in terms of how much of the current development rights pipeline is retail joint ventures, none of it. Again, we are talking to various folks. We do have a number of development rights which are partnerships with retail owners where ultimately we will own the residential and they will own the retail. We have a site in Woburn, Mass. It's in the development rights pipeline. It fits that description which is a partnership with EDENS.","We have a number of development communities currently underway like our deal in Towson with RPAI. That would fit that description or the Emeryville Public Market site. But the only development joint venture \u2013 two joint ventures we have right now is one that's wrapping up, which is North Point in Cambridge.","John Piljung Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, in this figure of asset densification, those are densification of efforts on your asset?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes. There's a couple of assets that we own, that we've bought through Archstone, one of which is in Mountain View, which we've talked about a little bit in the past; one of which is in San Jose; and there's actually a third one in Redmond, which is not on the list yet, but which will join the development rights pipeline in the third quarter. These are older garden communities where \u2013 with surface parking where the jurisdictions recognize there's a need for more housing as part of just an overall housing shortage in those markets and are willing to work with us to try and modify the entitlements to add density usually through replacing parking or replacing surface parking with parking deck, in some cases, just reducing the parking ratio because times have changed and there's not quite as much demand for parking.","John Piljung Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it, Okay. And then, a second question on development returns. This quarter, you had 170 basis point spread in devolvement yield between high-rise and garden developments. But I was wondering if you had seen a noticeable difference among development unlevered IRRs between high-rise, mid-rise, and garden projects based on your history of developing and recycling assets.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. It's an interesting question. Generally, I think we did \u2013 the last time we looked at that by product type, I think it was pretty consistent across the three baskets. High-rises will generally tend to trade at a lower cap rate and, in some cases, we developed high-rises in urban submarkets that were transitioning where we got in early like you think about Christie Place. We were very early there in the Bowery or our Riverview assets in Long Island City. So, sometimes that plays a part in it as well.","I would say probably in terms of risk-adjusted returns, high-rises are riskier in our experience both on the cost side and just the timing. It takes a long time to put the asset into production. So, you might argue that if gardens are getting same IRRs on a risk-adjusted basis, it's probably even a little better but \u2013 and that's probably over the last 10 or 15 years. I don't know. I'm guessing. Maybe a third of our development in terms of capital has been high-rise, probably two-thirds has been wood frame.","John Piljung Kim - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hello?","John William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hello.","John William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. If I'm looking at page 17, your development rights, are you at liberty to talk about where the numbers make sense? I'm assuming you've got some low basis in some of your land positions or your development rights which helped the yield on cost, but where did the numbers pencil out and where don't they in this day and age?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Do you mean kind of geographically or by...","John William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, geographically. You're talking about putting a lot of this into play I think.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Well, it's kind of \u2013 Kevin went over on the slide. Some of these are going to take quite a while to play out and others would be ready in the next year or two. The ones where the economics are holding better are \u2013 tend to be the more suburban deals where the entitlement process takes longer. And as you point out in some of those cases those are land deals that are four or five years old and maybe there's been a little bit less cost inflation pressure.","So you know some of the deals we have in suburban Boston or suburban New Jersey, those are deals that are less sensitive to changes in the cycle. And that's where you see frankly when you look at our development rights pipeline, it is a little overweight in the Northeast partially because of that. But in terms of the $3.5 billion that's there, it's \u2013 the allocation of what makes economic sense is probably consistent with just the total allocation that you see on that chart.","John William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And then second question, have you seen any signs that the merchant builders are perhaps laying off people or slowing down? Are they still locked and loaded and aggressively trying to build new product?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. We haven't seen \u2013 this is Matt again. We have not seen many signs of them slowing down yet. I would say I don't know if they're increasing capacity, but I would say they're still pretty full up. They still have pretty deep pipelines. And in fact, one of the ways we've tried to play that a little bit, as Tim mentioned, we are particularly in the expansion market working to \u2013 in addition to doing our own ground-up development, partnering with some folks that might have sites ready to go. And the Doral asset we started this past quarter is a good example of that where that's a deal that TCR \u2013 the local TCR office is the development sponsor. We're providing the capital. And then at the end of the day, we will buy out their position and wind up as a wholly-owned asset. But their take \u2013 they took the entitlement risk. They're taking the construction risk. We're taking the lease-up risk.","And we like that kind of business. We haven't done a lot of them in the past, but particularly in these expansion markets where there are some deals ready to go, where the economics still do look good, that's a good way to get some volume there.","John William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. John, maybe just to add to that quickly, as the publics are pulled back, which is interesting \u2013 and I agree with Matt. My sense is the merchant guys haven't necessarily increased, but not evidentially pulled back at all, but then \u2013 I think the other trend you're seeing, you just had some new entrants that probably made up or offset something with the amount the publics have pulled back. So overall, we're seeing pretty level volume and supply. And that's kind of what's in our projections kind of over the next couple of years.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Great. Yeah. I think I'd probably add to that is the multifamily focused public guys have pulled back, but the multiple product type REITs...","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","...maybe haven't.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Good point.","John William Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dennis McGill.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","...taking my question, guys. Just want to tie together a couple things you noted with on the turnover side, turnover being down substantially and you mentioned that being really across the portfolio and then wage growth similarly accelerating across the portfolio. Both would be pretty notable tailwinds to the rent growth side and it's been fairly stable over the last year or so. When you guys look at that, is that simply just supply overwhelming both of those factors or have you just been more cautious on the renewals for more defensive purposes?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Dennis, it's Sean. Good point on the tailwind factors and all else being equal would result in better performance. And I think that's what's reflected in the revised outlook is we are seeing better performance in the first half, really driven by occupancy, a little bit of rate \u2013 and in the second half a little more on the rate side. So, it is leading through in terms of better performance. And so, really, you've got better job growth, reduced turnover, good wage growth, all those are positive benefits.","Still meaningful amount of supply, but the supply was known. So, it is leading through for us in terms of better performance in the first half and what we're expecting in the second half, and that led to the revised outlook. So, if that's the heart of your question?","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Yeah. I think that makes sense. Essentially, there's a lag effect that you're seeing through the business. If we look at the blended rent growth in the second quarter, I think it was equal to or lower than a year ago in all the regions except for Northern California, but you've noted that flipped positively for the overall portfolio. Can you give us some color at the regional level as well as to how broad based that is as far as the reversals being positive year-over-year?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. I'm happy to do a little bit of that. As I mentioned, I mean if you look at Q2 2018, it's 2.8%. Q2 of 2017 was 2.9% so kind of rounding here and there. It's pretty much similar. In my comments, I mention that July is running 3.25% which is about 50 bps greater than what we had expected and a meaningful portion I mentioned is Northern California.","The rest of the markets when you look through it in terms of July, what we're experiencing is a modest lift in certain markets like the Mid-Atlantic, modest lift in Boston, Southern California is at par. New York is a little bit weaker. I don't have that number right off the top of my head. So, what I'd say is it's relatively broad based with the exception of a couple of regions but the order of magnitudes are different. The order of magnitude is more significant in Northern California and Boston as compared to the other markets. That describes it more generally. If you want specific data points so like going through all the markets, we can try to talk to you offline.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay, perfect. That's helpful for now, and then just one final one on the dispositions in the quarter and anything you might be marketing, can you just talk a little bit about the types of bidders that you're seeing and how those assets priced relative to your initial expectations?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, Dennis. This is Matt. It has been a pretty deep field I would have to say, pretty robust. Pricing has exceeded our initial expectations probably by maybe 10 basis points on the cap rate from where we expected it to be, maybe a little more. We are marketing a couple of West Coast assets now, one of which was out of one of our fund vehicles where it exceeded by more than that. But it's been \u2013 we sold an asset to Blackstone's multifamily private REIT. We've sold to some private buyers that we've dealt with in the past. There have been some foreign capital buyers pursuing some of these assets that we haven't seen before necessarily on some of the larger assets that are in the mix. So, I'd say the field, if anything, is probably a little deeper than it was maybe a year or two ago.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Perfect. That's helpful. Thanks, Matt. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wes Golladay.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. I just want to go back to that comment about the accelerated rent growth. I just want to get your opinion on what is potential drivers of that? You talked about the improving demand, but I was also wondering about the impact of having less concessions in the market, is that a big factor at all?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Wes. This is Sean. I mean for the most part across our markets, for most of the major public REITs and major private players, concessions aren't used a lot on existing assets. They're more used in lease-up communities. And for the most part, that's really concentrated in New York, given some of the rent regulations there where lease-ups could offer anywhere from one to three months of concessions depending on the lease term to establish a relatively high legal rent, and then they build their rent increases off of that.","But in terms of concessions, they're pretty de minimis overall, and the concessions are certainly down for us, and I suspect many others, which is helpful as it relates to revenue growth, but it's not a meaningful number relative to occupancy gains or rate gains overall. So, I wouldn't attribute it to that in a meaningful way except for maybe what you would be looking for in terms of performance in New York City specifically.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Okay. I was looking at more so like maybe having some private developers being maybe more rational this year, not pressuring the public REITs on new and renewal leasing. And then maybe if I could parley that to another question, I guess, with supply moving out of peak leasing season, some of us moving to 2019, but do you see any markets where there would be heavy supply in the second half of the year, maybe in the lower demand season?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I mean the numbers don't move around a lot from quarter-to-quarter. When you look at it, it's a little bit heavier in Q3 as compared to Q2 across our footprint for 2018. Q4 is up a little bit from Q3, but for us, the one with lease expirations during those periods particularly in Q4 is down quite a bit. So, it doesn't have much of an impact on the rent roll and the revenue stream given it's 20% of lease expirations. What you've been through for the first three quarters kind of base 80% of the year. So, even if there's some additional softness in certain pockets, where there's heavier supply markets like the District (54:16) is an example or maybe parts of Downtown Brooklyn. It shouldn't have a meaningful impact on us in that period.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Hill.","Ronald Kamdem - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. You got Ron Kamdem on the line for Richard. Just going back to the expansion markets, could you just \u2013 how should we think about when you're looking at the deals that whether at Denver or Southern Florida, can you just provide some color of some of the deals you may be looking at? What are the cap rates? Is it more deals than you thought, less deals than you thought, so on and so forth?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure, Ron. This is Matt. We are certainly looking at both acquisitions in the expansion markets, future development and then as I mentioned also in some cases looking at development that others might have ready to go where we could capitalize it. It's been very active, and if anything, I would say cap rates are probably down a little bit in both of those markets.","What we're finding in Denver, we're probably more interested right now in some of the assets that are a little bit more suburban where kind of like in our portfolio in our other markets, there's a little bit less supply and the kind of the risk adjusted return at this particular moment looks more attractive. In the long run, we'll look to have a diversified portfolio in both of those markets. But right now, stuff that is kind of high profile, sexy, downtown or in a walkable type Denver location is probably 4.25% to maybe a 4.50% cap. But in any cases, the assets coming out of lease-up are not really stabilized yet or it may be hard to tell because the lease-up pace may not be what really would sustain the rents that they're getting. So, our view on what that cap rate truly is might be a little lower than some other market participants.","In the more suburban locations in Denver, it's probably more or like high 4s cap rates, and in Southeast Florida probably similar. A little bit less in the market, not as much trades in Southeast Florida as in Denver but still an active market and kind of similarly there, we're being somewhat focused in terms of select submarkets those that are less exposed to supply right now.","On the development side, we think the yields there are probably comparable to in our markets. And if we do a deal like this deal we're doing in Doral, where we're partnering with a local developer, they're taking the construction risk. For us we're solving for yield there that's kind of halfway between development and acquisition yield because from a risk point of view, that's kind of an appropriate allocation of the risk.","Ronald Kamdem - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And if I could just go back to the Mid-Atlantic region, first, you talked about a little bit on the supply side, but maybe if you can touch on just the jobs outlook, not just this year, but into 2019 and 2020, that would be great?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hi, Ron. It's Sean. I mean, the data we have best available right now really reflects what's happened in the first half and projected for the second half, given the effect of stimulus and things like that that Tim addressed earlier, which is job growth being sort of in the 1.6% range for the full-year 2018. That's compared to the beginning of the year which was 1.1%. How long that plays out in terms of stimulus through tax cuts, regulatory reform, blah, blah, blah, all the various factors out there, it's hard to play out. There's certainly a lag effect but it spills over into 2019, but a bit too premature to speculate on what specific job growth would be in either 2019 or 2020 at this point.","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Hey. This is Matt. I guess the one thing I would add to that is, as it relates to the D.C. Metro specifically, certainly, the recent budget deal should lead to an increase in both procurement which is generally a pretty big driver of the D.C. Metro economy, I'm not sure we've seen that impact yet, but there's certainly a lot of talk now. There could be another government shutdown; that could change. But on the current phase we are at, there does appear to be from what we've read kind of a backlog of spending in contracts to be let that could provide a little juice for Northern Virginia and D.C., although obviously the devil's in the details.","Ronald Kamdem - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Santos (58:58)","Unknown Speaker","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just two quick ones from me. I was wondering \u2013 I'm sorry if you've answered this question already. If you could give us some background on the Miami development, how you chose the site and the partner? And then I was wondering if you could give us an update specifically on Boston supply?","Matthew H. Birenbaum - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure. I can speak about the Doral deal and then, I don't know, Sean, you may want to talk about Boston supply a little bit. Again, as I mentioned, we've been looking at sites that are ready to go, where somebody else \u2013 a local developer really starts with a sponsor, the quality of the sponsor, and we've known the folks at TCR for many years and obviously share a common heritage if you go back a long, long time. So, have a lot of respect for what they do. This is a site that's in Doral, which is one of the fastest-growing submarkets of suburban Miami. There is a grocery-anchored shopping center, which is part of the project, which is developed by another developer, which will be right at the front door. So, it's got some walkability. It's a seven-story, eight-story mid-rise, wrap product with structured parking. And it's a submarket that we like long term, and a sponsor that we think highly of, and that is, again, we'll be looking to do more of that kind of business.","And it's different than what we've done in the past, and it's different also in the sense that it doesn't really show up in our pipeline until the deal is ready to go because we're not funding those pursuit costs early. We're not taking that risk. So, we've been working on it for probably six months, but we didn't commit to in close until it was all ready to go. There's a third-party general contractor, but again the local developer is providing the completion guarantees to us.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. As it relates to supply, Daniel, I'm happy to take that as it relates to Boston. So, for 2018, supply currently is expected to be about where we thought it would be when we started the year, which is around 6,200, 6,300 units, something like that. It's down about 20% from what was delivered last year.","A good percentage of that reduction and deliveries is in sort of the urban markets of Boston, a little bit in the suburbs. As it relates to the outlook for 2019, supply should be running based from what we see today at a pretty similar level to 2018 again around 6,200, 6,300 units. So relatively stable supply outlook in Boston kind of moving from submarket to submarket, but in terms of total deliveries down in 2018 relative to last year, it looks pretty steady for the next 12 to 18 months in terms of the pace of deliveries.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. That's helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson.","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, now. Tim, early on in the call, you talked a little bit about what might be a short-term economic stimulus from all the things that have gone on maybe perhaps into 2019 or through 2019. With that in mind, do you feel \u2013 if this is an inflection point in terms of fundamentals for your business, do you feel a little bit less sort of sanguine towards it because of that short-term perspective you have? And maybe it's prompting you guys to do things before the music stops, or are you equally as optimistic about things relative to past cycles that you've seen as a manager of this company?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, Rich. I think that's a good question. I think you captured it, I think you captured it well. I guess, we'd say we're less sanguine at this point sort of as late in the cycle as we think we are. I mean you're starting to see areas in the country where there isn't much slack. If you look at the labor markets, it can be contingent upon labor force participation as when you're seeing unemployment at 4% and then for college grads, it's almost 0%, I mean, it's literally in the low 2s. So, there's not much slack and the labor markets continue to sort of drive household formation.","I think there is some opportunity still as it relates to household formation as the Millennials age. The most recent print on household formation was as strong as we've seen in a while. I think it's \u2013 you got to take that with a grain of salt that kind of moves all around, but I think it came in at 1.7% on a year-on-year basis, as strong as we've seen. I think that is a bit of \u2013 the number of young adults that are living at home as you would expect to go down as the leading edge of that age cohort starts to migrate towards their mid-30s and late-30s.","So, when you think about some of the inflationary pressures, you look at our business, the construction cost pressures are pretty acute. I don't see them necessarily abating because you've got \u2013 I mean, both the labor side and the material side, they're both not being helped by policy right now as it relates to tariffs and potentially immigration and the impact on skilled labor. So, I think there's a lot of reasons to be cautious as it relates to being aggressive in terms of deploying capital in this market and we probably are a bit more cautious than we would be in other points that may be showing some inflection.","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","And would you say that some amount of your kind of declining development or, say, elevated development risk management process is tied to that shorter-term economic perspective as well beyond the construction cost issue or maybe it's all just related to each other?","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","I think it's related. I think it's something that's been going on really for the last two to three years. I mean, we were much more willing probably through about 2015 to consider taking land inventory on the balance sheet that we felt we could get in production over the next year. Today I'd say we're not that willing, and we're pretty surgical about it. We had one deal in LA that we're willing to do that with because we felt like maybe that market had a little bit more legs than maybe some of our other regions and fundamentally, we don't think land markets have adjusted yet. So, yeah.","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay. Good enough. Thank you.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Sure. Very good.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Good afternoon. I hope you haven't addressed this yet, but I got onto the call late. Have you talked at all about just views on Costa-Hawkins, and kind of progress being made in regards to that in California?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Tayo, we haven't talked about it on the call. I mean, do you have specific questions around it in terms of...","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Just kind of how you're thinking about some of the momentum behind it, about possibly being on the ballot in November, and kind of what are you hearing locally from lobbyists about that, and what that potential implications could be?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah. I'm happy to address that. People have been asking about that through other means as well, but particularly around the likelihood of it passing and things of that sort. But, I mean, trying to give you a specific probability about it passing would be pure speculation on my part and anyone else I think that would be doing out there. In fact, there are polls out there that offer a wide range of answers.","What I'd say is, based on what we know, that if you simply ask voters in the State of California if they would support rent controls as it relates to controlling housing costs in the state more than a majority would likely say yes.","Based on what we know to the extent that you educate voters about what a repeal of Costa-Hawkins specifically means, the outcome could be quite different. There is a number of issues associated with Costa-Hawkins that voters have been educated about, including the impact on homeowners which represents about 60% of likely voters and putting single-family homes at risk regarding rent restrictions and potential reductions in the value of their home if the kind of single-family rental market and those buyers, the investor buyer starts to go away because of concern about rent restrictions as an example.","The fiscal impacts, the non-partisan LAO issued a report recently talking that a repeal could be detrimental to local government funding, particularly in terms of lost revenue from property taxes associated with single-family and cost of administration and all kinds of other things like that. Other issues that are out there relate to the conversion of rentals to for-sale product, which happened in San Francisco after the adoption of rent control, and there is a number of studies out there related to that topic.","So, there's a lot of different issues that people need to understand as it relates to what Costa-Hawkins means, what protections exist today that would potentially go away with a repeal. So, what I'd say is the messages are being delivered to voters and probably will be much more so over the next few months here in terms of what the repeal means. And those are the issues that will ultimately drive potential outcome when we get to election day.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Got you. All right. But, again, if it does happen, have you guys done any kind of analysis around what kind of impact it could potentially have on your portfolio?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, it's very much speculative in terms of what local jurisdictions will do. All we know is based on what's in place today for us, one asset would be impacted by rent control that currently isn't today. Other than that, it's trying to handicap every jurisdiction and which way they're going to vote in terms of putting a rent control measure on the ballot. Is that done through some kind of voter referendum or other means? So, that's all purely speculation. It's really hard to comment or quantify at this point.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Got that. Okay. Thank you.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And your final question comes from John Pawlowski.","John Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC","Thanks. Sean, I apologize if I missed some of these components. Could you just quickly run through 2Q new and renewal growth rates as well as early 3Q new renewal and occupancy?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yeah, John. Why don't I give you the Q2 numbers at the regional level, a lot of the other stuff, that's a fair amount of detail, so why don't I have Jason follow-up with you on that. I mean the Q2 blended rates were included in the supplemental as you may know by market and a royalty, you can see that. But as it relates to the difference between move-in, renewal and blended for the quarter, I could say New England move-in \u2013 when I do move-ins it...","John Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC","Total portfolio would be fine. Total portfolio.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","So, total portfolio for Q2 is included in the supplemental which is 2.8% blended, 3.9% on renewals, and 1.4% on move-ins if that's what you're looking for specifically. And then July, I mentioned 3.25% blended which is roughly 4% on renewals and about 2.5% on move-ins.","John Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC","And occupancy today?","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Occupancy today is sort of running in the low 96% range.","John Richard Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors LLC","All right. Thanks a lot.","Sean J. Breslin - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","I would like to turn the call back over to Tim Naughton.","Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.","Thank you, Travis, and thank all of you for being on the call today. I hope you all enjoy the rest of your summer, and we'll see you some time in the fall. Take care.","Operator","Thank you."]}}
