Welcome to NetApp\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.","I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","Kris Newton","Thank you for joining us on our Q3 fiscal year 2019 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com.","As a reminder, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606 in Q1. Our historical financial results have been restated to conform to the new revenue recognition rules. Reconciliations of our previously reported GAAP results to the restated 606 GAAP results as well as our 606 GAAP to non-GAAP results are included in our Q3 earnings release for the applicable periods, which is posted on our website, along with our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table, and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-GAAP and 606 numbers.","During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2019, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, and our ability to grow and expand our opportunities and address the key market transition, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections.","Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including global political, macroeconomic and market conditions and our ability to expand our total available market, introduce and deliver new and differentiated products and services without disruption, manage our gross profit margins, capitalize on our market position in cloud strategy, maintain execution, and continue our capital allocation strategy.","Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018 and our current reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George.","George Kurian","Thank you, Kris, and thanks to everyone joining us today. In the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we focused on the variables within our control and delivered a strong third quarter. Although I\u2019m disappointed with revenue being at the low-end of expectations, our operational discipline delivered gross margin, operating margin and EPS that were above the high-end of our guidance ranges.","Regardless of the demand headwinds, we remain well positioned for the long-term, as we address the growth areas of the market and provide an efficiency in our business. I\u2019d like to address the challenges we saw in Q3 head on. The macroeconomic environment is outside of our control, but I remain exceptionally confident about our strategic position and operational focus to deliver profitable growth and shareholder value.","After a normal close to the calendar year, we saw slowdown in purchasing across the Board in January, driven by deteriorating outlooks for the global economy, as well as uncertainty around trade policy.","In the face of these headwinds, our largest customers became more cautious in their purchasing behavior and sought more information on the implications for their businesses of slowing economies. We did not see any real change in the competitive environment. Our wind rates stay constant and our pipeline remains healthy. Our customers\u2019 purchasing decision continue to be based on our features, capabilities and future-proofed cloud integration strategy.","Even in the face of softening demand, we were able to further expand product margins in the third quarter by focusing on the value our solutions bring in addressing customers\u2019 largest IT imperatives. Like any company, we do not have perfect visibility into all the reasons for purchasing slowdown.","However, we are deeply involved in the strategic planning and purchasing process of our large customers and have good visibility into how they deploy us and where we fit into their IT strategy. We remain tightly engaged with them, and as such are confident that we have the right product set and the right go-to-market strategy to continue capturing a greater share of our customers\u2019 IT wallet.","Our unique customer value is reinforced by digital transformation initiative, which are fueling data center modernization projects and cloud-first strategy to succeed in the data-driven digital economy and radically improved business performance, customers need to accelerate digital innovation, generate real-time insights and secure access to their data across multiple clouds and on-premises.","This requirement for hybrid multi-cloud capabilities is creating three significant market transitions: disk to flash, traditional IT to private cloud and on-premises infrastructure to hybrid clouds. It is in these key strategic battlegrounds that we have substantial opportunity to exploit the advantages created by the NetApp Data Fabric and take share.","We are driving the market transition from disk to flash, as we help customers modernize, simplify and improve application performance. We are displacing competitors\u2019 complex equipment, gaining share in new workload deployments and upgrading our installed base with cloud-connected all-flash solutions.","In Q3, our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services grew 19% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.4 billion. We are over-indexed in the large and growing all-flash market with a significantly higher all-flash array share than in the total storage market.","Our advantage here will continue, as the market shifts to flash, and we expect that shift to accelerate with ongoing NAND price declines. All-flash arrays carry a higher ASP, which benefits not only product revenue, but also recurring services revenue, with only 15% of our installed base currently running all-flash arrays. The runway for this secular transition remains in the early innings.","The second major market transition we\u2019re exploiting is the shift from traditional IT to private cloud. SolidFire and NetApp ACI are the building blocks for private cloud deployments, enabling customers to bring public cloud-like experience and economics into their data centers.","In the third quarter, we announced new validated and proven architectures that simplify the design, deployment and support of on-demand services and applications, as well as support hybrid cloud workflows with an on-premises S3-compatible object storage. Customers are embracing our unique value that couples extreme ease of use with enterprise scalability and quality of service. And as a result, the momentum in our private cloud business that began in the October quarter accelerated in Q3.","The shift from on-premises infrastructure to hybrid clouds is the third key market transition that we are taking advantage of to expand our business. Only NetApp is building a comprehensive set of cloud data services available across multiple clouds. We help customers extend on-premises environments to the cloud, deploy enterprise workloads in the cloud and build and refactor primary workloads for the cloud, with tools to optimize hybrid cloud workloads and cost.","Based on the last month of Q3, our cloud data services annualized recurring revenue is approximately $33 million, up 22% from Q2. As we said before, this is a foundational year for our cloud data services, during which we are focusing on operational readiness and deployment with the hyperscalers.","We are excited by the feedback that we are receiving from the growing number of customers who are in controlled production with us. While still in early phases, we are well-positioned for when these services soon become broadly available, roughly two-thirds of early cloud volume service customers are new to NetApp. This, coupled with the strong customer interest we are experiencing, gives us tremendous confidence in the potential of this part of our business.","In closing, we are confident in our position for long-term success. We are a leader in the large all-flash array market. We are seeing accelerating momentum with our private cloud solutions and our public cloud solutions are positioned to deliver strong growth in FY 2020.","We are playing into the big market transitions from a position of strength. Flash and cloud integration enables us to protect and expand the installed base of our core ONTAP business. Our private and public cloud solutions enable us to reach new buyers. Our flash, hybrid cloud infrastructure and AI solutions are serving as pillars of customers\u2019 new architectures, and we are seeing adoption of our cloud offerings as part of our customers\u2019 foundation for moving applications and data to the cloud.","These factors, combined give us confidence in our ability to reaccelerate growth, as customers become more comfortable with the external environment. We have demonstrated discipline in managing the business and we\u2019ll continue with the keen focus on the factors within our control.","We are paying close attention to execution, to maximize our opportunity in an uncertain macro. We again expanded gross margin and increased profitability in the quarter, despite the slight moderation in customer buying behavior. I would like to thank the NetApp team for their commitment to a high-level of discipline, execution and customer focus.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q3 financial performance and go-forward expectations.","Ron Pasek","Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As George highlighted in Q3, we delivered strong margins and operating leverage in the face of caution from our customers around the macro environment.","This is a solid testament to the strength of our underlying business model. Despite the market uncertainty, we are confident in our product leadership and strategy to reaccelerate growth going forward, and we remain sharply focused on execution and managing the variables within our control.","Consistent with our commitment to shareholders, we again improved gross margin, operating margin and delivered outstanding free cash flow. In Q3, despite a slower demand environment experienced in January, net revenues of $1.56 billion were within our guided range and grew 2% year-over-year, including about a point of currency headwind.","Product revenue of $967 million increased 2% year-over-year, reflecting our shift to all-flash arrays and growing traction in our private cloud solutions, offset by about 150 basis points of currency headwinds. There were no ELAs in the quarter.","Moving down the P&L. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $531 million increased 2% year-over-year, driven by our continued growth in our installed base and to a lesser extent, our cloud data services business.","Gross margin of 63.7% was above the high-end of our guided range. As expected, we saw the normal seasonal sequential decline in product margin from Q2 to Q3. Product gross margin came in at 52.6%, which is an increase of about 100 basis points year-on-year, reflecting continued sales force discipline in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty and about 50 basis points of currency headwinds.","This was the eighth straight quarter, we increased product margins year-over-year. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 81.7% increased about 50 basis points year-over-year.","Operating expenses of $629 million were down 2% year-over-year coming in lighter than anticipated, largely due to lower variable compensation. We remain committed to strong OpEx discipline and continue to expect operating expenses for fiscal 2019 to be roughly flat year-over-year.","Operating margin of 23.5% came in solidly above the high-end guidance and represented a new company record. EPS of $1.20 was above the high-end of our guided range and increased 14% year-over-year. We closed Q3 with $4 billion in cash and short term investments.","Similar to Q2, we again saw healthy growth in deferred and financed unearned services revenue, which increased 7% year-over-year and was up $151 million sequentially. Deferred revenue growth continues to be a strong leading indicator of the health of our installed base.","Our cash conversion cycle remained extremely healthy at a negative 11 days, which is roughly flat year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $451 million. Free cash flow of $420 million represented 27% of revenues, while year-to-date free cash flows of $804 million represents 18% of revenues.","Q4 has historically proven to be a strong seasonal period for free cash flow conversion, as such we remain committed to driving free cash flow of 19% to 21% of revenues for the full fiscal year. Our confidence in our long-term vision and execution is reflected in our capital allocation strategy.","During Q3, we purchased 8.1 million shares at an average price of $67.84 per share for a total of $550 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $255 million, down $21 million year-on-year, representing an 8% decline.","We have $2.4 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and will continue to be aggressive given NetApp\u2019s free cash flow yield and return on invested capital profile. During the quarter, we paid out $99 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $649 million to shareholders, representing 155% of free cash flow generated in the quarter.","Now on to guidance. Customer caution around the macro backdrop has heightened, as we entered the new calendar year. As a result, we expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.59 billion and $1.69 billion, which at the midpoint implies flat revenues year-over-year. It is worth noting that our Q4 revenue guidance includes 200 basis points of currency headwind and is off a very challenging Q4 2018 compare, where we grew total revenue by 11% year-over-year.","Consistent with the normal seasonal sequential decline in gross margin from Q3 to Q4 associated with product revenue being a larger portion of the overall revenue mix, we expect Q4 consolidated gross margin to range between 62% and 63%. We expect Q4 operating margin to be between 23% and 23.5%.","We expect earnings per share for the fourth quarter to range between $1.22 and $1.28 per share. The midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance implies total fiscal 2019 revenue growth of 4.6%. Our Q4 guidance also implies fiscal 2019 gross margin of 64.3%, operating margin of 22.7% and EPS growth of 28%.","As we look out to FY 2020 and beyond, I\u2019m confident in our ability to reaccelerate growth and deliver on our long-term profitability targets. We remain diligently focused on both disciplined execution and continued innovation.","In the phase of a slower demand environment, our business model leverage and the secular tailwinds created by the three key market transitions: flash, private cloud and cloud data services, will enable us to continue to deliver on the commitments we\u2019ve made to shareholders, partners and customers.","With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?","Kris Newton","We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Andrew Nowinski","Okay, thanks a lot. Thanks for the question. Maybe I\u2019ll just ask some question as it relates to kind of your guidance that you gave at Analyst Day regarding fiscal 2020 and 2021. I\u2019m curious just given the result that we saw today in your guidance for Q4, would you say, you\u2019re still expecting to deliver at least 2% earnings growth over the next two years? And then also on the revenue, is that mid single-digit still valid?","George Kurian","Hi, Andy, yes, that is our plan and you\u2019re seeing in FY 2019, we\u2019re going to do well above that. And yes, our long-term guidance is still at the mid single digits on the top line absolutely.","Andrew Nowinski","All right. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Andy. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Partly, Rod Hall, please check your mute button. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel.","Matt Sheerin","Yes. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Just relative to the weakness that you are seeing from your large enterprise customers, it look like your direct business was down 12% year-on-year, that was the first time and I think six quarter, you were down. And \u2013 but your channel business was up mid single digits.","What do you think the difference is in terms of the tone of smaller customers versus large customers, because if you look at all the channel partners that have reported, they all talked about fairly strong growth and still good outlook for this year?","George Kurian","Our largest customers are the ones that we serve through a direct pathway. The broad range of customers are served through a channel model. The largest customers are the one that are most affected by some of the uncertainty, both economic and political uncertainty around the globe and we saw incremental caution in their buying behavior in January.","Ron Pasek","Matt, the other thing that\u2019s a little misleading just to factor in is, in Q1, Q2, we did have ELAs, which show up in direct revenue. So they skewed the direct number a little bit higher. If you adjust for that, we\u2019re always within the last, say, eight quarters, 2018. And again, that\u2019s where the demand if fulfilled, not necessarily where it\u2019s created.","Matt Sheerin","Okay. And in terms of the ELAs, you didn\u2019t have any revenue. You\u2019ve had some good revenue there in the last few quarters. Is that more of a timing issue and related to the weakness that you\u2019re seeing from your large customers?","George Kurian","No, there\u2019s nothing to do with that. Nothing at all. It\u2019s just \u2013 as we said, when we first started talking about ELAs, they tend to be difficult to predict and lumpy. And there weren\u2019t any we had in the quarter or anticipated to have.","Matt Sheerin","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Rod, please go ahead.","Kris Newton","Let\u2019s move on to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you. Ron, can you talk about the gross profit at a product level. If you could bridge that sequentially from last quarter to this quarter the 150 bps sequentially? And given the revenue deceleration that you have seen, do you think that you can hold the 50% product gross margin over the next year or so, especially when the competitive environment becomes a little tougher with around the mid range storage product launches that are anticipated to happen later in the year?","George Kurian","Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. Yes, I mean, if you look at the last eight quarters, we\u2019ve grown product margins each of the last eight quarter year-over-year, and our intent is still to do that. The target we gave you was 55% to 56% and we still plan to do that.","The bridge from Q2 to Q3 on the product side, remember, this is a always a seasonal thing happens with the public sector quarter being Q2, and then typically we have a fall off in that business. So that\u2019s very traditional we saw that each of the last five years. So we had some of that seasonality affects over the headwind and then we had no ELAs in the quarter. We had them the last quarter, and then that\u2019s offset with some benefit from NAND pricing.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay, great. And, George, just a quick clarification for you. I think you noted that elasticity of demand could sort of kick in, given these NAND prices. Is there typically three to six-month lag, but you expect to see this elasticity of demand with the macro environment sort of clouding, maybe the elasticity of demand from kicking in faster?","George Kurian","We think that over time, as NAND prices continue to decline that customers will shift the mix of their business from disk-based systems to flash-based systems. We saw good acceleration in our flash system counts through the course of the quarter. We saw some incremental caution in terms of how much capacity customers were buying, which could be correlated to buying or today\u2019s needs as apposed to building out for their entire future requirement.","So we saw a little bit of that. It \u2013 it\u2019s reflective a bit to the macro environment. We believe that as NAND prices continue to move favorably, it gives us an opportunity. We are well positioned in the flash market. We have strong differentiation with software, which has allowed us to preserve and even grow gross margins. And if you look at the ASPs of a flash-based system as opposed to a disk-based system, they are actually higher. So we think that\u2019s a good trend for us to capitalize on.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Wamsi. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Aaron Rakers","Yes. Thank you for taking the quick questions. First of all, could you just help us understand, I mean, the rate of deceleration that you saw during the month of January? And as you thought about the guidance for this third quarter, your assumptions on how maybe February pointed out and how \u2013 what assumptions you are making relative to what you saw in January as far as any kind of improvement? And I have a quick follow-up.","George Kurian","I would say that, we felt very good about where we were within the quarter sort of heading into the Christmas holiday, and things changed materially through the last week of December and really January. I think that we did not see any change in the competitive dynamic win rates or any of those aspects. We just saw an increased amount of scrutiny in terms of spending within our customers them requiring more approvals and just buying for today as opposed to buying the full scope of what we plan to buy with us.","I think that with regard to some of our largest customers, the global customers that are exposed to geographies around the world, as well as to public sector, there will be time before they come back to their normal course of spending, right? Some of that is related to sort of clarity on how their business is impacted, and some of that like in public sector is, it takes time to get the work force back into normal operating cadence, which is reflective of our caution in Q4","Aaron Rakers","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then on the NAND pricing front, can you just help us understand what rate of declines you\u2019re currently seeing on the flash side? And how you would characterize your ability to hold flash pricing in the market?","Ron Pasek","The price declines we\u2019re seeing are not perfectly linear. They continue to go down. I think what we \u2013 you\u2019ve got to remember is, the storage industry in our company\u2019s history is predicated on decreasing commodity pricing. So, in many ways, as stores sort of earlier catalyzes demand for new use cases and drives the never-ending appetite for increasing data consumption.","So it\u2019s something we\u2019re predicting, that\u2019s why we have a \u2013 over rotation on flash. We know that that\u2019s the growth area. Price reductions help that growth. As George said, you see the elasticity between the different types of media. And so as NAND prices come down, more workloads move to all-flash.","George Kurian","And we\u2019re seeing that. If you look at system counts and capacity counts through the course of this fiscal year, they have been both up quite substantially. I think what we noted this quarter, especially in January was a little bit of a step back in caution around capacity. System counts continue to be really good.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. Thank you very much.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Aaron. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question, I appreciate. Hey, George, on \u2013 any greater context you could provide on what your large customers are using as signpost? I mean, you mentioned, George, I think in the prepared remarks, if they\u2019re looking at their end business?","And then just a quick follow-up to that. Do you have any sense, if they are pausing on how broad is a pausing on new implementations or the milking \u2013 not milking, but in a sort of raising capacity on the product \u2013 on existing project. You mentioned that they might be adding less capacity on new projects like that, I would just love anymore context around those two things? Thanks.","George Kurian","I think it\u2019s too early to draw broad conclusions. I would say that January represents the new budget cycle for a lot of our customers. And as they get their planning in place, I think they took a little bit longer this year than typical because of the certainty. I think we saw the transformational projects that have multi-quarter implementations continue apace.","I think in the next new projects, I think, people were probably a little bit more cautious, waiting for clarity in terms of how their business rolled out. I would say, in terms of our book of business, all of the strategic areas of focus for us all-flash arrays, private cloud and our cloud data services, we feel good about our progress across all of those dimensions. there it really reflects the strategic aspect of our discussion with customers and we feel good about the progress in all of those dimensions.","Ron Pasek","Just keep in mind, even if you isolate Q3, it\u2019s really \u2013 we were up 2% from midpoint. And if you look at the full-year based on the midpoint in Q4 guide, we\u2019re off maybe a little over almost 2 point in the full-year. So in the scope of the greater scheme of things, we\u2019re still pretty much on exactly what we thought from mid single digits.","Ananda Baruah","That\u2019s great. Thanks for the context.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Ananda. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Katy Huberty","Yes, thanks for the question. Ron, for you one gross margin guidance. If I look back at the last two fourth quarters, total company gross margins were actually up a little bit sequentially despite the fact that the lower-margin product business was growing very fast, and you didn\u2019t have as much help from NAND. So can you just talk through why here you think total company gross margins are down sequentially?","Ron Pasek","So, Kath, I think the better compare is really year-over-year, and I think that\u2019s a more meaningful compare. And then remember, what we typically see sequentially is and you see this from Q1 to Q2 to Q2 to Q3 generally and Q3 to Q4. The higher weight of product margin and product revenue which grows \u2013 this is a slightly lower margin than the services margin, so that always puts pressure. That\u2019s a mix issue that we see all the time.","Katy Huberty","Okay. And then just George, just as a follow-up. I think a year ago, you talked about exiting this fiscal year with, perhaps\u2026","Kris Newton","I think, we lost Katy.","Katy Huberty","Sorry, sorry. Just a follow- up for George, at about a year ago, you talked about exiting this year with $6 million of cloud services revenue. And it looks like you\u2019re tracking a little bit below that. Why do you think that is, or is that not the right way to think about it? Thanks.","George Kurian","We are in the foundational year of our cloud data services business. I would say, we are a bit behind where we expected to be in terms of the operational readiness of our service offerings with our cloud providers. We are, as we said, generally available with AWS. We are in controlled pilot production projects with both Azure and Google, and we expect them to be available eminently.","I would say that we are probably 0.5 basis point towards below where we guided for the full-year revenue, but we are excited that the results that we\u2019re seeing. It confirms all of our expectations in terms of differentiation. We have broadened the range of use cases and workloads that we serve. And so as soon as we get to generally available with these cloud providers, we feel very good about our ability to inflect the business and return the accelerate that.","In terms of our long-term model for cloud data services, we\u2019re not backing off the projections we had. As Ron mentioned, we feel confident about our long-term model for the whole business, as well as for our cloud data services.","Katy Huberty","Thank you, George.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Katy. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Fox","Hi, good afternoon Just one other question on the slowdown you saw in January. Is there \u2013 could you isolate it to what verticals maybe were more \u2013 will you sort more in terms of the slowdown, or geographic regions? And given we\u2019re talking about longer-term start-up projects, like what would you say would be the extended decision timeline versus what you previously thought for these things closing or it\u2019s starting to ramp its pacing originally anticipated?","George Kurian","I would say that one of the areas that we talked about as having some decisions pushed out was in U.S. public sector, where we said in Q2, some decisions pushed out. We saw the recapture of preponderant majority of those decisions in Q3, and we were able to move those projects forward.","With regard to the broader macro, I don\u2019t think there were any specific industry trends that we noticed. I think that clearly, those industries with specific exposure to China and public sector were incrementally more cautious. But I think there weren\u2019t any other specific trends that we could draw out.","With regard to the U.S. public sector, as we said earlier on the call, we think that it will take sometime for the government to get back to full fledged operations. And so we don\u2019t have perfect visibility into how projects shape out through the course of the coming quarter, so we\u2019re being incrementally cautious there.","Steven Fox","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Steve. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes, thank you. One question for George. How do you see the replacement cycle for 10-k RPM playing out for the remainder of 2019. Is it going to be more of late in the year, or should we think of this cycle kicking in next year? And for Ron, how \u2013 I know this is a little bit far out. But as we look into fiscal year 2020, how aggressive are you going to be in managing your OpEx?","George Kurian","I think, let me take the 10-K RPM drive question. I think there\u2019s still work to be done to get a viable solution to replace some of the capacity points that 10-K drives were focused on. If you notice, the majority of the 10-K drives that are still being deployed are actually lower capacity points than some of the TLC NAND solutions that are available in the market at comparable effective dollar per gigabyte price points.","So, you can see some customers that say, listen, \u201cI want to strategically move to all-flash for its benefits that increasingly start to look at that as an option. But I think for the full transformation to happen, you will need quad layer cell or the next sort of capacity price point in the NAND cycle, and we\u2019re working on that, but it will take sometime.","Ron Pasek","So, Mehdi, on your OpEx question, it\u2019s a little early for that. But I\u2019ll remind you what we said at Analyst Day last April. So I guided this year to be roughly flat in OpEx and actually next year as well. But remember, we\u2019re still actively doing a ton of transformation, so we\u2019re still doing a lot of investment and a lot of disinvestments. So it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re just staying flat, not doing anything. We\u2019re really working and getting a lot more efficient.","George Kurian","In terms of just to underscore that point, we have made all of these bets into the new parts of the market, private cloud, all-flash arrays, cloud data services and new pathways to market, while simultaneously improving operating margins to a record. This quarter, operating margins the highest \u2013 being the highest in the company\u2019s history, right?","So we will continue to stay disciplined on the operating expense side of the business, but we\u2019re not going to forego strategic opportunities for short-term gain. I think we have maintained discipline and you\u2019ll see us continue to invest into the future opportunities, while being prudent about overall spend.","Mehdi Hosseini","Thanks, guys.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Mehdi. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Alex Kurtz","Yes. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. George, just on hyperconverged, I know this has been a big area of investment for the company over the last couple of years. I know it\u2019s still kind of working its way through the channel and with the sales organization if we\u2019re looking to fiscal 2020. Are you prepared at this point to provide kind of a run rate that you think is reasonable or a percentage of product revenue, or just serve the contribution to the overall product side of the business, that would be helpful to understand?","George Kurian","Our overall private cloud business, meaning, SolidFire deployed standalone or as part of a hyper-converged model. For large customers, they deploy standalone for smaller and mid-market customers they deployed as hyper-converged, as well as object storage, which are deploying for cloud native applications in a private cloud form or a substantial contributor to NetApp\u2019s revenue this quarter.","I\u2019m not prepared at this point to break it out. But I can tell you that, they performed in a really good pattern across customer accounts, revenue contribution, units, you name it, we guide it. And we think that as we look forward to fiscal 2020, it gives us a really strong second leg foundation to our growth, right?","So we\u2019re already a leader in the al-flash array market. We are seeing accelerating and materially accelerating momentum in the private cloud game. So stay tuned. We\u2019ll tell you more as we headed to fiscal 2020.","Alex Kurtz","All right. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Alex. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Tim Long","Thank you. Ron, you talked a little bit about the installed base when referring to the software, hardware maintenance and services. Just give us \u2013 if you can just give us a little more color there. It was up a little bit year-over-year. It looks like was down a little bit sequentially, so is there a seasonal pattern there as well?","And when do you think we could expect to see that line with a little bit more sustainable growth? Is it dependent on just all-flash array being a bigger piece of the overall base or cloud data services or what do you think will help move that line to higher more sustainably? Thank you.","Ron Pasek","Yes. So as we talked about, we continue to grow system counts in the installed base. And remember, up until two years ago, we had 13 quarters of sequential decline in a row on the product side. So we\u2019ve really got to get back to 13 quarters of year-over-year increases in installed base to really get back to where that you\u2019ll see that grow again. So we\u2019re probably several quarters away from that.","We don\u2019t \u2013 as you know, we don\u2019t guide that discretely, Tim. So even though, we\u2019ll give guidance on the next call for FY 2020, I won\u2019t guide it specifically. I\u2019ll give some general color, though.","Tim Long","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Tim. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening in your competitive environment? And to what degree your growth is driven by your customer base upgrading their base of NetApp platforms versus to what degree are you dependent on basically taking footprint from others in the marketplace? Thank you.","George Kurian","We did not see any change in the competitive dynamic through the quarter. I would say that when you look at our all-flash array business, it is expanding wallet that we used to not have within our traditional enterprise customers, as well as through our cloud solutions, both private cloud and certainly public cloud solutions, we are expanding to net new customers.","I\u2019ll simply give you some data, which says that, of all of our cloud customers that we are engaged with either through the hyperscalers or through our own cloud software offerings, two-thirds of them are net new to NetApp. So they\u2019re opening up new relationships and new logos for us to acquire.","So we did not see any fundamental change within the competitive landscape. We think that as the market transitions from disk base to flash-based systems, given that we are a leader in all-flash with a substantially higher market share percentage than we are in disk, there are a lot of weak large players in disk-based systems that we will take share from: IBM, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Oracle, HP, there\u2019s a lot of them. And even Dell has a challenged mid-range portfolio and IM portfolio. So we feel good about our opportunities. We\u2019ve got to execute to capture them.","Simon Leopold","Thank you for taking the question.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Simon. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Jason Ader","Yes. Thank you. George, Cisco just reported, and they didn\u2019t see the macro issues that you guys apparently did. So I\u2019m just wondering how do you explain that number one? And number two, do you think there might be something else going on in terms of maybe NAND pricing causing some customers to delay just because they want to see where prices go in the market?","George Kurian","We did not \u2013 I can\u2019t comment on what Cisco saw or not, so I would leave that to Chuck to comment. I think with regard to our business, what I can tell you is, we maintain discounting through the end of the quarter. So it\u2019s not a matter of hey, if you offered a lower price, customers would step forward and transact.","I would tell you based on being involved deeply in many of these transactions, we saw an increased level of scrutiny on transactions, where you would have to get more purchasing approvals or provide for greater explanation of ROI or business case or things like that.","And so I would just tell you that, if it were as easy as providing a discount to deal with forward price NAND contract, we have the vehicles to do that and we would have applied those.","Jason Ader","Okay. And then one quick follow-up for you, George. Just on AWS reinvent this year, Andy Jassy spent like a half-an-hour talking about Amazon\u2019s new file-based storage offerings. And I was just wondering what impact you think that might have on your offering through AWS?","George Kurian","We continue to see really good uptake of our cloud volume software through AWS. And so I\u2019m sure he has his own offerings, but that hasn\u2019t had any impact on NetApp.","Jason Ader","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Jason. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","George Iwanyc","Thank you for taking my question. George, Europe looked \u2013 behaved a little bit differently, it look relatively strong. Can you give us an idea of what\u2019s happening there? And then I have just a quick follow-up as well.","George Kurian","It was really good execution by European team. We are the leader in all-flash arrays. In many parts of the European market, we have deep strategic relationship with customers. There is volatility in the European political landscape. We did see some GDP changes. We\u2019re being cautious about the overall environment, but I just want to say that our team executed well and stayed in control of the business till the end.","George Iwanyc","Okay. And can you give us an update on your Lenovo partnership? I mean, if that\u2019s helping in China?","George Kurian","It\u2019s too early to comment about the success of the partnership. We are in the market. We are seeing wins that are additive to the NetApp footprint. It\u2019s too early for me to categorize them in terms of size or color except that, listen, this is additive to NetApp.","I think with regard to China, it gives us a pathway into that market that is isolated from some of the trade tensions. The NetApp team finished the \u2013 their \u2013 the NetApp quarter well and executed well, and I want to thank them for that. And we\u2019re looking forward to the joint venture getting off the ground soon enough, and we\u2019ll keep you posted as the news of that and the operational readiness comes online.","So we feel like, the China approach that we have is positioned well to endorse all of the challenges that might exist between the geopolitical \u2013 in the geopolitical relationship, and it allows us to focus from a branded channel perspective on the rest of the world, while Lenovo helps us with their enormous resources in China. Stay tuned.","George Iwanyc","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, George. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Paul Coster","Thanks for taking my question. The macro uncertainty that you saw in January, that was manifested in the flat changing behavior of your large customers. Was that also true of the cloud service providers either as partners or even as customs?","George Kurian","We don\u2019t \u2013 the three major hyperscalers, meaning, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, do not buy hardware from us. They work with us where we deliver a service through their data centers to customers. So they\u2019re more like a partner. We saw no evidence of them backing off. In fact, the range of used cases and the deployments that we have with them are widening rather than narrowing.","What \u2013 there are other cloud service providers who we sell to and sort of not the superjumbo hyperscalers. And across them, there was a variety of puts and takes. I think many of them are being careful to prioritize the investments around their best opportunities, for example, 5G wireless, right. So I would just say, they\u2019re going through one of these evaluation of priorities process and so we did see some changes in that mix.","Paul Coster","Okay. And then the other sort of big factor of things happening, of course, is more and more workloads and data is being pushed through the edge. Are you seeing any manifestation of that through your business?","George Kurian","Yes, we are pleased by the growth of the used cases that we are deploying in the edge. So we have software-defined solution that are part of ruggedized environments that are deployed at the edge in industrial and public sector use cases. We saw good traction. We saw good traction with our objects storage portfolio, providing a private cloud for certain advanced telemetry use cases in autonomous driving.","We saw good adoption early, but still good adoption of some of our AI solutions to crunch the data that it generated at the edge and brought back to the core. So we remain optimistic that our solution portfolio is good and differentiated. And the number of growth engines we have, as the macro stabilizes, is certainly broadening from even a year ago.","Paul Coster","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Paul. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","Thanks very much. George, I think, you\u2019ve been very clear about the demand environment and a lot of questions on that. So maybe I\u2019ll switch the question over to Ron. Ron, in the past few quarters, there were several ELAs that came up, and then NAND this quarter.","I think some people were thinking that ELAs might just kind of be a normal course of doing business. So with none this quarter, is the normal course of doing business is one or two a quarter kind of not really how it\u2019s going to turn out, or were there a couple of customers who signed ELAs and just other people don\u2019t want that, or how \u2013 any type of behavior change on just kind of the topic of ELAs or just simply is it lumpy and we shouldn\u2019t expect it to be one per quarter or something like that?","Ron Pasek","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. Last quarter, I mentioned it\u2019s hard to anticipate when they\u2019re going to land. So I gave a full-year view this year and the next year as you should expect roughly 2% of revenues as ELAs. It is lumpy. They\u2019re hard to predict. There will be quarters when they\u2019re zero, there will be quarters when they\u2019re quite a bit more than that. So it\u2019s just a really difficult thing to predict and I can only give a full-year guide on it. It\u2019s going to make some quarters difficult compares. This quarter \u2013 this year in Q1, we had a very robust ELA quarter, that\u2019s going to be a difficult compare.","Jim Suva","So that sounds like, yes.","George Kurian","Hey, Jim, we did not anticipate ELAs nor did we see them. So it performed according to plan.","Jim Suva","Yes. I just want to make sure there is no change in behavior. It was more just a timing of it and things like that?","Ron Pasek","That\u2019s right. And remember, we did about $90 million in Q1 and about $20 million last quarter in Q2. So we really don\u2019t have much left to do to get to that full-year 2% guide.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much for the clarifications. It\u2019s greatly appreciated.","George Kurian","Sure.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Jim. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Karl Ackerman","Good afternoon, George and Ron. I guess, Ron, looking at prior gross margins, excluding ELAs, with enterprise SSD prices declining roughly 20% this quarter and the next, would you expect to see massive whip higher in your product gross margins beyond April? And you continue to improve hardware and maintenance margins, certainly an impressive feat for sure.","What do you think has been the biggest key contributor to that improvement in hardware and maintenance margins? And why would I be wrong to conclude that business couldn\u2019t have perhaps an eight handle on gross margin over the next few years? Thanks.","Ron Pasek","Yes. So the first part of your question, I \u2013 we are seeing some benefit in total margin for NAND. But it\u2019s really more of a focused effort really over the last eight quarters, not just in the last couple of quarters. So, it\u2019s hard to anticipate what might happen, and I\u2019m not going to telegraph what I think might happen other than I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll get back to 55% or 56% eventually on product gross margins. I\u2019ve been pretty clear about that.","On the hardware and maintenance margins, I think you\u2019ve got to be a little careful. We do have competitors in the space. We have to be careful what our margins are and what we charge. We need to make sure that customers feel that we can provide a quality service at a reasonable price, and and they can see those gross margins as well. So you\u2019ve got to make sure they\u2019re not ridiculous.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Karl. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of the Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you. George, you talked about the importance of executing in the future. Could you talk about the evolution of your go-to-market? And one thing I\u2019ve heard is that, NetApp may not be as good as some competitors in selling to new customers, not as comfortable selling up to the CTO, the CIO, the CFO and I know that this is also part of your selling value to get that 55%, 56% product margin, so kind of an update on go-to-market?","George Kurian","I think it\u2019s a place that we continue to work to improve our capabilities, right? I\u2019d say that over the last year-and-a-half, two years, we\u2019ve opened up new pathways to market, for example, with Lenovo into parts of the world that we have historically not had a lot of footprint with the hyperscalers into the top of the accounts, where big digital transformation projects are and have expanded the total addressable market as a result of solutions like our private cloud solution.","We have continued to optimize our sales coverage model. So that we can align resources to go after net new accounts and net new workloads. And we believe there\u2019s substantial total available market for us to go address. And so this is an area where we have to improve and we\u2019re going to continue to try to do so every quarter.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Steve. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Your line is now open.","Eric Martinuzzi","Yes, question for George. The \u2013 in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about the installed base being such a terrific opportunity, because I think it was only 15% that gotten their purchasing the all-flash array. In some ways, that\u2019s encouraging, because it shows the wide open opportunity, but in some ways we\u2019ve heard that number, at least, I can recall hearing it several quarters now. I\u2019m just wondering what is it that\u2019s got the installed base maybe reluctant is the wrong word, but what can you do to enhance the adoption of all-flash in the installed base?","George Kurian","The installed base is a very, very large number of systems. And so what \u2013 as we are growing our flash systems, we are also simultaneously growing our installed base, right? So, both numerator and denominator are growing. The things that will help capitalize the movement are really consolidation and economic projects to improve that installed base.","As flash gets cheaper, it certainly makes it a more viable prospect to help customers upgrade their installed base, as some of these next-generation data center projects get underway and our customers there has opportunity to certainly improve that conversion. But it will take time just given the magnitude of that installed base.","Eric Martinuzzi","Do you have any like a two to three-year horizon, where you expect that 15% could become 25% or 30%?","George Kurian","I don\u2019t have any forecast at this point. I do think, it will follow the trend of our flash opportunity. And we\u2019re mindful of the fact that they are installed base is an opportunity.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Eric, Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Todorov with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Nikolay Todorov","Hey, guys, good afternoon. It sounds like you are rightfully cautious on the large customer side in the U.S. public sector. But I just want to understand your underlying guidance assumptions for the channel business. Are you guys as rightfully as cautious as there, or there\u2019s a little bit more optimism and to that end of the market? And overall, what is the outlook for 2019 hardware spending that you\u2019re getting from the channel business?","George Kurian","We have roughly 80% of our business fulfilled through the channel, and that\u2019s the number that we break out in the categorization of our financial metrics. That number has stayed relatively stable for a very long period of time, and we don\u2019t foresee a substantial mix shift this coming quarter or next year, right?","I think within that channel number, there are a set of customers that the channel fulfills for large customers and others for small. The small medium customer segment performed better this past quarter. We continue to believe they are a growth opportunity for us given our share in that market. We are more cautious about the large customers who have global businesses.","Nikolay Todorov","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Nick. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Rod Hall","Hi, guys, can you hear me this time?","Kris Newton","We can.","George Kurian","Yes.","Rod Hall","Well, it\u2019s a miracle. Okay, thanks for the chance again. I wanted to zero in on the year-over-year growth rate on the revenue. I just \u2013 I\u2019m looking at the trend here back in April of 2018, it was 11% and 11.6% then 7.2%, then 1.6% in January, and then you\u2019re guiding for basically flat, maybe down just $1 million or $2 million. And so I guess, what I wanted to ask is, whether you believe this April guided quarter hit the bottom on that trend? And if you don\u2019t believe that, why not? And if you do believe it, why do you believe it\u2019s the bottom?","Ron Pasek","So, I think what you\u2019ve got to remember is the guide we gave, which looks roughly flat year-over-year has 2 points of currency headwind. The 11% you mentioned last year had 2 points of currency tailwind. I would think it was \u2013 we\u2019re going to do mid single digits next year, that\u2019s the guide I can tell you right now. So I don\u2019t know how that will quarterize, but obviously, that has to be \u2013 we have to be growing from where we\u2019ll end in Q4.","Rod Hall","So, Ron, you\u2019d be just saying that then the January quarter is the bottom. And if you have the 2 points back, you\u2019re kind as well, you\u2019re kind of flat lining on the growth that you saw in January and then from here, we can guess what the trajectory might be?","Ron Pasek","Right. That\u2019s right.","Rod Hall","Okay. Thanks for that.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Rod. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is now open.","Nehal Chokshi","Yes, thank you. So I think DSOs were up five days year-over-year. So presumably, that means that things were a little bit more back-end loaded than usual. Yes, you talked about how you did see a slowdown at the back-end of the quarter. So A, can you help bridge that, perhaps maybe you saw a loosening up of that demand at the end of the quarter, but not enough to make up for the shortfall at the beginning of January?","Ron Pasek","Yes, Nehal, it was really hard. I mean, it was not back-end loaded. We saw kind of that demand as we talked about kind of wane in January, so that\u2019s not the issue. When I dissect the reason for the escalation DSOs, which is not significant, it\u2019s just a mix of customers that have slightly different terms than they did last year, wherever you end up with collections at the end of the quarter based on that group of customers could be different than the prior year compare or prior quarter compare. I would point out that we\u2019re still in a very negative cash conversion cycle, so I\u2019m pretty happy about that.","Nehal Chokshi","Okay. And then my\u2026","Kris Newton","Go ahead, Nehal.","Nehal Chokshi","Yes. George, you mentioned that you\u2019re a bit behind on the operational capability of the cloud services, which are cloud service providers. Could you delve into why it\u2019s behind? And then also there has been some management shakeups at some of these cloud service providers that create some opportunity for NetApp as well?","George Kurian","Well, we\u2019ve got really good longstanding relationships with them. We are performing deep technical integration of our technology into their service delivery platform and we\u2019re going through tests to get certification, right?","So we are going to be imminently available and we look forward to that. We are excited that the production pilots that we have going on with their customers. So, stay tuned. I think we have an expanding range of opportunities through those could providers.","Kris Newton","All right. Well, thank you, Nehal. We appreciate it, and I\u2019ll pass it back to George for some final remarks.","George Kurian","Thanks, Kris. Despite the near-term demand headwinds, cleared by the uncertain macro, we were able to beat on gross margin, operating margin and EPS. We continue our strong discipline in managing the business. As the economic uncertainty abates, we are well-positioned to reaccelerate our positive momentum by capitalizing on the key market transitions created by digital transformation.","We are playing into these transitions from a position of strength. Our solutions allow us to reach new buyers, while growing our installed base. We are a leader in all-flash. The momentum in our private cloud business is accelerating. Our public cloud solutions with large hyperscalers are poised to deliver strong growth in fiscal 2020. All of this supports our confidence in our long-term model for mid single-digit top line growth.

Welcome to NetApp\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.","I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Ms. Newton, you may begin.","Kris Newton","Thank you for joining us on our Q1 fiscal year 2019 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com.","In Q1, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606, a historical financial results have been restated to confirm for the new accounting revenue recognition rules. Reconciliations of our previously reported GAAP results to the restated 606 GAAP results as well as 606 GAAP to non-GAAP results for fiscal 2017 and 2018 by quarter are included in our Q1 earnings release, which is posted on our website, along with our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table, and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future projections, such as our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2019, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, and our ability to grow and expand our opportunities, all of which involve risks and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections.","Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including global political, macroeconomic and market conditions and our ability to expand our total available market, introduce and deliver new and differentiated products and services without disruption, manage our gross profit margins, capitalize on our market position in cloud strategy, maintain execution, and continue our capital allocation strategy.","Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018 and our current reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP and 606, unless otherwise indicated.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George.","George Kurian","Thanks, Kris. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We delivered a very strong first quarter and are starting fiscal year 2019 in a stronger position than we\u2019ve been in for years. Revenue, gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share were all above our guidance. This performance reflects our success with customers, who increasingly view us as a critical strategic partner for their data-driven digital transformation.","Enterprises see the value of our Data Fabric strategy and are signaling strong confidence in NetApp by making long-term investments in our software IP to enable the Data Fabric across their entire enterprise. The world is being transformed by digital technology. To succeed in this data-driven economy and radically improve business performance, customers need real-time insights and secure access to their data, regardless of where it resides.","The NetApp Data Fabric empowers our customers to do so, while taking advantage of capabilities in the cloud across multiple hyperscalers, operate with hyperscaler cloud-like infrastructure, and modernize traditional IT with flash and connections to the cloud.","These capabilities underpin the biggest market transitions as customers shift to cloud, new forms of converged infrastructure and flash, and we continue to expand our opportunity by innovating with the Data Fabric, broadening its reach by delivering the next-generation of flash-empowered SAN and integration with the hyperscalers, as well as increasing its value with new applications and services such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and analytics.","We continue to deliver software-differentiated innovation and maintain strong momentum across our key priority areas, all-flash arrays, new forms of converged infrastructure, and cloud data services, which represents the biggest opportunities for NetApp to grow and reset the landscape of our industry.","The market transition to flash, which is still in the early stages, creates enormous new opportunity for us as we consolidate and displace competitors\u2019 legacy equipment, gain share in new workload deployments, and upgrade our installed base with our cloud connected all-flash solutions.","At the start of Q1, we expanded our all-flash array innovation leadership with the introduction of the AFF A800, designed for high-performance in cloud to power artificial intelligence and data-intensive applications like machine learning. The AFF A800 supports the industry\u2019s first end-to-end NVMe architecture, combining NVMe\u2019s solid state drives with NVMe over Fiber Channel to deliver lightning fast response times.","Based on the new SPC-1 benchmark results, performed under real-world conditions with deduplication and compression-enabled, the AFF A800 is the top performing enterprise all-flash array among the industry\u2019s leading storage providers. With the latest version of ONTAP, which we shipped during the quarter, we continue to expand our SAN technology leadership by delivering NVMe over Fiber Channel capability as a non-disruptive software upgrade on current-generation AFF platforms.","NVMe over Fabric gives customers the performance of server-attached storage with all the benefits of shared network storage. Our leadership in this area allows us to further expand our opportunity by displacing direct attached storage over time.","In Q1, our all-flash array business, inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF, and SolidFire products and services grew 50% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.2 billion. Validating the innovation leadership and momentum of this part of our business, Gartner again recognized NetApp as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Solid-State Arrays. Another way we\u2019re expanding our opportunity is through participation in the rapidly growing area of artificial intelligence.","Earlier this month, we announced ONTAP AI, a solution combining NVIDIA DGX supercomputers and the AFF A800 to create a seamless data pipeline across edge, core, and cloud for deep learning deployments.","The unique scope and reach of the Data Fabric enables customers to lay down the right foundation to collect and bring together all their distributed data and then apply artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to it. By helping customers unify all of their data for AI, we empower them to deliver better business outcomes.","Enterprises are choosing our converged and hyper-converged solutions to build out their private clouds, because they\u2019re simple, standardized, and rapidly deployed.","FlexPod continues to be a platform for customer innovation and investment protection. In the first quarter, we announced new FlexPod solutions to simplify the delivery of cloud infrastructure and deliver focused industry-specific applications.","With NetApp HCI, customers are able to accelerate digital transformation by developing a next-generation cloud architected infrastructure that manages data and services as one integrated resource, supporting both public and private clouds. A European-based financial services firm chose NetApp HCI to be the foundation for its private cloud.","Our ability to provide a future-proof platform to host current workloads and support future multi-cloud requirements, enables us to win against Nutanix. With cloud like simplicity, NetApp HCI offers enterprises the ability to run multiple applications with predictable performance, as well as scale compute and storage resources independently to avoid costly and inefficient over-provisioning, capabilities that the first generation HCI vendors cannot match.","Our cloud data services partnerships with Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are unique to the industry and are game changing for NetApp\u2019s long-term opportunity. Not only are we able to participate in enterprise workloads that are moved to the cloud, we can address born in the cloud workloads and customers, and our entire portfolio is made stronger by being cloud connected. ","Five years of delivering ONTAP as software in the hyperscaler marketplaces has given us the unique understanding of the requirements in the cloud. We have identified how to deliver high-performance, highly scalable cloud data services with a robust feature set and support for protocols the cloud does not natively provide. Because of the leverage in our R&D we have been able to bring hundreds of engineers to bear on this problem without negatively impacting innovation in other areas of our business or expanding our OpEx stack.","Only NetApp has partnerships with all the leading hyperscalers and a complete cloud data services strategy for customers. In July, Microsoft announced the public preview of Azure NetApp Files, an Azure native service powered by NetApp technology, enabling enterprises to overcome the challenge of deploying file-based workloads to the cloud.","Also in July, we announced expanded availability for NetApp cloud volumes for Google Cloud platform to help customers deploy workloads, such as DevOps, video rendering, databases and commercial high-performance computing. In Q4, we began onboarding customers with NetApp cloud volumes for AWS.","To bring to life, why a customer would choose NetApp in the cloud, I\u2019ll share with you two examples: one, that is a cloud-only solution; and the other a customer of our on-premises solutions expanding into the cloud. The first is a large genomic information company that shows NetApp cloud volumes for AWS and plans to go live with NetApp Services in other clouds.","They selected us, because our high-performance, shared storage service enabled them to gain dramatic improvements in processing and complete analyses that they could never finish before, all while lowering their compute costs. They are recommending that their customers, pharmaceutical companies and hospitals adopt cloud volumes. With cloud volumes, they offer consistent performance and advanced functionality, while allowing their customers freedom of choice on the cloud.","The second example is a global fashion brand taking its first steps into the cloud. Because of our multi-year relationship with the customer, we were able to help them understand the value of our cloud data services, while reducing their sense of risk. In addition to the purchase of SaaS backup services from NetApp, they expanded their footprint of on-premises all-flash arrays.","Fiscal 2019 is a foundational year for the SaaS part of our business. And I\u2019m pleased to report that based on Q1, our annualized monthly recurring cloud data services revenue is approximately $20 million. We are transforming our business to reflect the way customers want to consume our technology.","The world is steadily moving from being compute-centric to data-centric, and customer consumption patterns are shifting from data center equipment to hybrid cloud services. Our competitors are struggling to adapt to the new cloud era and continue to fall behind.","With demonstrated leadership in key market transitions, we are reshaping our industry. We will share more industry changing news with you at our Insight Conference this October. Our results are evidence that we have the right strategy and are driving success with focused innovation and relentless execution.","As we continue to grow and transform, we will maintain our focus on efficiency and shareholder value. At our last Analyst Day, we laid out a compelling long-term model and capital allocation plan. And as you can see by our strong Q1 results and capital returns, we are on track to deliver against this plan.","I\u2019m honored, excited and humbled by the opportunity ahead. I want to thank the entire NetApp team and our partner ecosystem for all they do to help drive our success.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q1 financial performance and go-forward expectations. Ron?","Ron Pasek","Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.","As a reminder, we adapted the new revenue recognition rules ASC 606 this quarter. Our historical financial results have been restated to conform to the new accounting rules. Reconciliations of our previously reported GAAP results to the restated 606 GAAP results, as well as our 606 GAAP to non-GAAP results for fiscal 2017 and 2018 by quarter are included in our Q1 earnings release. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP results unless otherwise noted.","Our Q1 results reflect the increasing strategic importance of NetApp to our customers, as they undertake digital transformations and embrace multi-cloud architectures. We expect continued progress throughout fiscal 2019 towards the long-term business model we laid out at our Analyst Day.","Before discussing guidance, I\u2019ll provide detail on our performance for the first quarter. Net revenues of $1.47 billion grew 12% year-over-year, driven by product revenue of $875 million, which increased 20% year-over-year.","Product revenue came in higher than expected, reflecting the continued strength of our all-flash array business, as well as roughly $16 million from strategic enterprise agreements, which we did not include in the Q1 guidance. Enterprise license agreements or ELAs or enterprise-wide deals where NetApp is a key strategic partner in implementing the customer\u2019s broader digital transformation.","From a revenue recognition perspective, the new 606 standard requires the software product components of ELAs to be recognized upfront. Under the old 605 standard, these software licensing agreements were recognized ratably across the life of the deal, typically three years. The increase in ELAs reflects our strategic presence within large global accounts and there\u2019s strong confidence in the value of the NetApp Data Fabric.","While a clear positive for our business momentum, the structure of these ELAs, coupled with the upfront revenue recognition, makes their financial impact lumpy and difficult to predict. We did, however, include about $30 million of revenue from ELAs in the guide for Q1. Moving forward, we will continue to take a conservative approach in predicting the timing and size of these strategic deals. As such, we will not be including ELAs in our guidance for Q2 nor the remainder of fiscal 2019.","Moving down the P&L, software maintenance revenues of $229 million increased 3% year-over-year, reflecting traction of our cloud data services portfolio and continued growth in our installed base. Hardware maintenance and other services revenues of $370 million were flat year-over-year. As a reminder, we said that the combination of software and hardware maintenance revenues should not be a headwind in fiscal 2019.","Gross margin was 66%, above the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin of 56% increased 6 points year-over-year, reflecting the benefit from the software portion of the ELAs and continued sales force discipline. Excluding ELAs, product margin was approximately 51%, up 1.5 points year-on-year. Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up 2 points year-on-year due to the benefits from ongoing transformation efforts.","Operating expenses of $650 million were in line with our expectations. We remain committed to strong OpEx discipline and expect operating expenses for fiscal 2019 to be roughly flat year-over-year. Operating margin of 22% was above our guided range. We had a strong start to the capital allocation plan we announced at our Analyst Day. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares at an average price of $74.37 per share for a total of $500 million.","Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $269 million, down $4 million sequentially and $9 year-over-year. EPS of $1.04 was up 75% year-over-year, predominantly driven by the healthy growth in product revenues and expansion in product gross margin.","We closed Q1 with $4.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. Similar to Q4, we again saw healthy growth in deferred and finance unearned services revenue, which increased 4% year-over-year. During the quarter, we paid out $105 million in cash dividends. Our fiscal Q2 cash dividend of $0.40 per share is payable on October 24.","As highlighted at our Analyst Day, we remain committed to increasing our dividend over time. Our cash conversion cycle of negative 20 days improved to 28 days year-over-year, reflecting a 23-day increase in days payable outstanding and an eight-day decrease in days inventory outstanding, partially offset by a one-day increase in DSO. DSO decreased by 20 days sequentially from Q4.","We had another outstanding quarter of cash generation with cash flow from operations of $326 million, an increase of 30% year-over-year. We generated strong free cash flow of $262 million in the quarter, which represented 18% of net revenues and as an increase of 22% year-over-year.","Now on to guidance. To clarify, we remain confident in our mid single-digit fiscal 2019 revenue growth forecast before any benefit from Q1 ELAs or any additional ELAs we may realize throughout the year. In addition, we are raising our guidance for fiscal 2019 margins and EPS to reflect the better than expected Q1 results. Gross margin guidance increases to 63% to 64%, up from 63%, and operating margin guidance increases to approximately 22%, up from 20% to 21%.","In fiscal 2019, we are now committed to delivering EPS growth in the mid-20s the versus the original guidance of greater than 15%. Our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate of approximately 18% remains unchanged.","We expect to continue to generate meaningful free cash flow in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues, enabling our disciplined approach to investing in growth, as well as our continued commitment of returning significant capital to shareholders. We also remain confident in our long-term three-year growth forecast for revenue and profitability.","Now on to Q2. As a reminder, Q2 guidance excludes any benefit from ELAs. We expect net revenues to range between $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 6% increase year-over-year, including more than a half a point of currency headwind.","We expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to range between 63% and 64%. We expect fiscal Q2 operating margin to range between 20% and 21%. We expect earnings per share for the second quarter to range between $0.94 and $1 per share.","In summary, I\u2019m confident regarding our growth opportunities, especially as it relates to our compelling cloud strategy. Additionally, I\u2019m very pleased with the disciplined execution of our team. We are well-positioned to continue to deliver on the commitments we\u2019ve made to our shareholders, partners and customers.","With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A.","Kris Newton","I\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.","Rod Hall","Yes. Hi, guys, thanks for the question. I guess, I wanted to dig into the product gross margins, which are quite a bit stronger than we expected them to be? And see if you guys can tease out maybe what some of the moving parts there were? So in other words, with NAND price declines, did that help the margins? Are there mix effects going on? Just maybe give us a little bit more color on what drove those strong margins? Thanks.","George Kurian","So, Rod, I think it\u2019s a couple things. Obviously, it was benefit of the ELAs this quarter, that was about 2 points when you do the bridge year-over-year. We also had a little bit of favorable FX, and we had a little higher software mix this quarter. The NAND pricing definitely did help a little bit, but it gets offset when you have to take the hit to resell. So there might have been some benefit initially, but then you have to write the inventory down as the standard decreases.","Rod Hall","Could you also just say on that front, are you passing NAND pricing through pretty much, or what\u2019s your thinking on that as we go on through the rest of the year?","George Kurian","Our intent will be to eventually pass on the price decreases, yes.","Rod Hall","Great. Okay, I appreciate it.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Rod. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. George, when you look into January and April call of next year, I\u2019m not I asking for any guide. I just wanted to see what your views are in terms of the continued upgrade that is going on within your enterprise customers? This has proven to be a multi-year upgrade cycle? And I want to see how much \u2013 how do you see this upgrade cycle sustaining beyond the October quarter that you just guided to? Thank you.","George Kurian","We see that enterprise IT spending, as you have noted, is benefiting primarily from the strength of the global economic outlook. IT spending, we\u2019ve always believed is correlated with economic outlook. Within that, we benefit from a few different specific situations relative to our business.","From a portfolio of technology perspective, we have shifted our investment and our portfolio and consequently our revenue mix into high-growth areas of the market. We see that we can benefit uniquely when customers spend either on the public cloud or on-premises unlike competitors that we have that remain only on-premises.","And finally, as businesses become more data-intensive and builds more data-intensive environments like machine learning, high performance storage, and data services are benefiting from spending intentions. So, we think that this will continue for a period of time. I think, at the macro level, IT spending will be correlated to economic growth. So if economic growth slows down, I think it will impact IT spending in aggregate.","Mehdi Hosseini","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Manny. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Srini Nandury with Summit Insights Group.","Srini Nandury","All right. Thank you for taking my question. On the AFA sales, can you give us some color of what percentage of installed base has already moved to the new AFA? And then, can you also give me some color on in terms of competition in unit pricing in general? Thank you.","George Kurian","AFAs are now 14% of our installed base, so it still remains a small percentage of the installed base. As we said, we have continued to gain share in the market and outpace the overall market. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of market outperformance and reflects the strength of our offering.","Relative to competition, I think we see the broad mix that\u2019s available in the market. Dell, HP, Pure, and Nutanix are the most common ones. I think, we have a really good competitive position against all of them, both because of the capabilities of our specific solutions as well as the unique benefit we bring by allowing customers to deploy our solutions on the public cloud or in their data center, something that we call the Data Fabric, so our win rates have been strong, and we\u2019re excited to expand the range of competitive situations we engage in.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Srini. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a quick clarification and then a question. On the clarification, I believe the prior EPS guidance of 15%-plus reflected no assumption around share repurchase. Just curious whether the mid-20% EPS guidance does include buyback or not?","And then secondly, can you just give us some guardrails around what you expect in terms of range of potential outcomes for ELAs in future quarters? Will there be quarters with zero ELA revenue and then quarters like July, where it could be $50 million to $100 million? What\u2019s sort of the ranges of outcomes as we think about modeling that through in the next couple of quarters? ","Ron Pasek","Sure. Katy, to answer the first part of your question, we assumed the guide for EPS assumes no further share repurchase. So it\u2019s just what we\u2019ve done in Q1 and the benefit of that from a diluted share comp perspective.","Secondly, with respect to ELAs, this is really difficult to predict when they\u2019ll happen. And to your point, yes, there will be quarters when they will be zero, which is precisely why I said, I would not guide them. It\u2019s \u2013 even when you think you might get one, it\u2019s hard to predict and the timing is very difficult. And they are so large that if you include it and you miss it, it would be a big miss. I\u2019m trying to think of that \u2013 was there one other part?","George Kurian","This is why, I think, we \u2013 as we laid out the plan for the year, we are reconfirming that our revenue outlook is mid single-digit without ELAs. ELAs would be additive to the revenue baseline that we have established. And so if you think about it, we\u2019re essentially guiding upward for the rest of the year.","Katy Huberty","Okay, understood. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Katy. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Yes, thank you, and thanks for taking the question. Yes, I wanted to ask about the HCI product. I think, one of the pieces of the story has been the strong growth that you\u2019ve been able to report quarter-after-quarter in your flash business.","I\u2019m curious as we think about HCI and the competitive landscape against Nutanix and others, is that an incremental revenue stream that we could look at over the next couple of quarters that starts to get broken out? And is there any framing or any kind of qualitative or quantitative commentary you can provide of how big that business is today? Thank you.","George Kurian","With regard to whether we will breakout HCI or not, we\u2019ll provide you that clarity when we do it. At this point, HCI is a part of our product revenue. We have seen a broader number of competitive engagements and we are winning our share, right?","So we feel very confident about the value proposition that we bring to the market. We see that it\u2019s a meaningful expansion of the total addressable market that we serve, and we\u2019re going to continue to stay focused on innovation and consumer expansion. We\u2019ve had good competitive wins against all the leading competitors in that category. And it reflects the architectural difference that we bring to enterprise grade hyper-converged.","And so we\u2019ll give you more details. Come to NetApp Insight, we have some really exciting product announcements at NetApp Insight, and you\u2019ll see how we build NetApp HCI into our compelling Data Fabric story there. So look forward to it.","Aaron Rakers","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Aaron. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Tim Long","Thank you. Just one and a follow-up, if could. First, on the cloud data services. Thanks for providing the run rate there. Is \u2013 I think the thinking \u2013 the logic was this could add something like 100 basis points of growth this year. Could you talk a little bit if you would have to ramp from these levels? Could you talk a little bit about the pipeline and how quick quickly you think this business could ramp?","And then second, just some clarification on the ELAs. I get the difficulty to predict, but could you talk a little bit about the other benefits, whether it\u2019s increasing installed base, more equipment sales, that are ancillary benefits of these larger strategic deals that you\u2019re signing? Thank you.","George Kurian","Let me just start with the cloud data services business outlook. As we said, we are off to a good start. We\u2019re excited about the value we bring to customers. We talked about both cloud native customers, who we\u2019d never served, as well as expanding large footprint with both \u2013 with enterprise customers who we\u2019ve served in the past and both of those opportunities are in front of us.","With regard to the availability of our offerings that we said, we are \u2013 generally available with AWS. We are in private preview with Microsoft, and we are in pre-data with Google. So we are in an early stage of customer trials. All of these offerings should be generally commercially available this quarter.","So you\u2019ll see much broader availability of those offerings this quarter, and the pipeline is healthy. We are excited at what we see going forward in terms of the used cases, DevOps, analytics, as well as database as a service on the public cloud.","With regard to the ELAs, let me just say that I\u2019ve been involved in these transactions. As Ron mentioned, they are strategic relationships with the largest customers in the world, where they standardize on our software across a broad part of their enterprise. It is a validation of the strategic value of our NetApp Data Fabric that customers are buying into a broad footprint standardizing on the Data Fabric.","But as Ron mentioned, these are complex transactions, where they can shift between CapEx and ELA and a variety of different structures within the ELA. One of the things that you see with this year\u2019s ELA form is that, our operating system is now a standard part of the ELA, which is an indication that our Data Fabric now becomes seeded in a very large footprint in the biggest customers in the world.","And so we\u2019re excited. We think this is bullish for NetApp. And Ron can tell you more about how we think about it specifically in terms of the financial aspect of our business.","Ron Pasek","I think, it is a validation of our technology. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re really happy about. They are long-term commitments and agreements of these customers. And just to give a little perspective, they\u2019ve really grown from when we started adding the OS portion into the ELA offerings.","Last year, when we did the restatement in FY 2018 for 606, the full-year was only $20 million in ELA. So growing now to at least $90 million just in Q1, you can see, it\u2019s a big uptick, so very, very important. It will make our results from time to time within the year little lumpy. So you can see a little more volatility in gross margin, but over the long-term really no effect.","Tim Long","Thank you.","George Kurian","It also doesn\u2019t change the fundamental seasonality of our business, right? I think it just reflects the nature of transactions that are lumpy and hard to predict, but it doesn\u2019t change the fundamental seasonality of our business.","Tim Long","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","All right. Thank you, Tim. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner","Hi, thank you. Just thinking about the gross margin guidance for the full-year, it seems pretty low considering how high margins were this quarter. I understand the ELAs helped significantly in the quarter. But how should we think about margins rolling through as we move through the year?","Ron Pasek","So it \u2013 what I did Sherri was I kept the same guide we had previously gave at Analyst Day for the year, and simply added the benefit of the Q1 over achievement, nothing else has fundamentally changed to George\u2019s earlier point, the underlying seasonality is still the same.","George Kurian","I think one thing to note Sherry is that, our product revenue is growing much strong, much faster than service revenue. So if you model it on a year-on-year compare, the mix continues to save a product, which is at a lower gross margin than services, right?","And so we continued to push towards the long-term commitments that we had made around product gross margins in the 55% range. We\u2019re making progress, but it\u2019s the mix of product and services that are affecting the full-year gross margin picture.","Sherri Scribner","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Sherry. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.","Andrew Nowinski","Great. Thank you and nice quarter tonight. I just wanted to get more color on your AFA growth basis. So you\u2019re the only vendor shipping an end-to-end NVMe solution right now. And you\u2019re the only vendor that separated your hardware from software enabling customers to support hybrid cloud environment, and you also have the HCI option.","So I\u2019m wondering if the acceleration in your AFA growth rate from just \u2013 more from just existing NetApp customers that converted off last this quarter, or is it the additional offerings like HCI in the cloud services that you have? Did that alter your win rate versus vendors like Pure Storage and EMC that don\u2019t have those offering more often to accelerate your new customer growth?","George Kurian","I think, if you look at the installed base penetration of the AFA, they\u2019re at 14%, which is a small number. This represents the fact that the majority of our wins are in new workloads and at existing customers or net new customers. The strength of our hybrid cloud story is a major part of our value proposition, because simply speaking, we allow customers to do what no one else can.","You can start to build a high-performance machine learning environment in the public cloud and when you\u2019re comfortable with doing so, you can move it on-premises with your data completely intact and secure or conversely you can build a secure data lake in your own data center and give you a data scientists public cloud work spaces that are compliant with GDPR regulations.","So we have a really unique value proposition in the marketplace. With end-to-end and NVMe, we are also able to attack direct attack server workloads, because we offer the same performance of server connected storage with all the benefits of shared network storage, efficiency, single point of management, better fault-tolerant and so on. And so that\u2019s an additive part of the market that we are able to go after.","And then with the broadening of our portfolio across flash, converged, hyper-converged and cloud, we are now able to address a full platform of customers use cases. And the strategic ELA is that customers are signing with us is simply the reflection of the elevation of our value proposition with them. And so we are excited at what that means in terms of the traction of the Data Fabric, not only with the hyperscalers, but now with our largest customers in turn.","Andrew Nowinski","Great. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Andy. Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital Markets America.","Lou Miscioscia","Yes. So thanks for taking my call. So just two quick questions. The first one is on guidance. I know that you\u2019re actually guiding to mid single digits year-over-year growth, but I guess, last quarter you did also talk about sequential growth. And if I look at my model, if I\u2019m modeling this correctly, if you actually grow sequentially at a normal, let\u2019s call it, 5% or 6%, you should actually be at the high-end of the range. So maybe you can give us just some puts and takes and thinking as to why from a quarter-to-quarter basis, the balance isn\u2019t a bit higher here? And congratulations obviously on good numbers.","Ron Pasek","So, Joe [sic] [Lou] the \u2013 as I said earlier, the benefit in Q1, we had a large ELA benefit that blew away the guide we gave for the quarter. The underlying seasonality is still there. As I tried to indicate, the ELAs will make some of the seasonality a little more lumpy.","So you\u2019re right. Sequentially, it is down from Q1 to Q2. However, Q2 guide that we gave is up year-over-year, I\u2019d say, 6% with a little bit of currency headwind. So you\u2019re going to see a little bit of some anomalies as we go forward. When we have these ELAs, they\u2019re going to make things a little bit less predictable.","Lou Miscioscia","Okay, great. Thank you. In the press release you did mention StorageGRID twice. I\u2019m just wondering if that product is starting to see traction in the sense that object storage has been a little bit slow to take off and obviously you\u2019re doing so well in some of the other areas, but it\u2019d be nice to get a little visibility here?","George Kurian","StorageGRID is now a recognized leader in objects storage. We see a range of use cases for StorageGRID either for new object deployments or coupled with the file system as an archival tier using our FabricPool technology. We will provide more details of the applications of StorageGRID at our Insight User Conference.","There are some interesting use cases for automotive and some other IoT examples, where a highly scalable solution like StorageGRID has really interesting applications. I will tell you more at Insight.","Lou Miscioscia","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Lou. Next question?","Operator","The next question is from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.","George Iwanyc","Thank you for taking my question. George, your mature products are doing very well. Can you give us a sense of what\u2019s driving the strength there and how sustainable the outlook is?","George Kurian","So as we said, the headwind from mature are \u2013 have dissipated. The mature product category used to contain three components: OEM, our legacy 7-Mode technology and add-on storage, driven either by 7-Mode or our clustered storage systems in all-flash arrays.","OEM has done \u2013 has had a good quarter. It can be lumpy through the course of the year depending on the performance of our OEMs, but we had a strong quarter this quarter. 7-Mode is basically not being sold anymore, so it\u2019s no longer relevant to our business. And add-on storage had a strong quarter, reflecting the strength of our all-flash array business.","So what I would tell you is, categorizing mature and strategic as separate items is no longer relevant, right? Because a large part of the mature business is now being driven by the strength of our strategic products. And so I think that\u2019s a better way to look forward is just to look at the aggregate product revenue, which you can see is very strong.","We don\u2019t think that mature is going to be a headwind anymore. And as we said last year, could be also a tailwind to our position this year. And so we\u2019re excited at the start. We think that we should continue to see good progress in our mature \u2013 in the mature bucket.","George Iwanyc","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, George. Next question?","Operator","Your next question is from Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much, George. The all-flash array traction you have has been absolutely fantastic. It\u2019s, as you know, a very dynamic marketplace, where a lot of up-and-coming companies have claimed victory and going to really disrupt things. Yet, some of the more traditional companies who\u2019ve been innovating throughout time how much yourself have continued to gain share and knock them off, so to speak.","Can you talk a little bit about the all-flash array landscape and how you see it? Is there still a lot more new start-ups innovation? Do you think it\u2019s going to be a consolidating market? How should we view it? I assume that large corporations want established companies such as yourself and others. But can you just walk us through about the all-flash array, from where you sit as CEO, the marketplace you see?","George Kurian","We see that, first of all, the core value in the all-flash array market is in world-class software that allows customers to deploy a range of media, but to drive their business process for advantage, right? And I think, we have really good software. And I think, any other company that wants to compete in that market has to have really good software.","We see that the 3D NAND environment will continue to materially benefit flash over performance drives over the next few years. As we have said consistently, as prices ameliorate for 3D NAND, which we are starting to see clearly, that performance drive, the 10-K drive segment will concede to the all-flash array segment.","There are future derivatives of flash, capacity flash or things like persistent memory, Optane DIMM, for which we have really good solutions for. And I think, we feel that what customers will need is a single way to manage your data across, not only all of these types of media, but all the places you put data in, which we call the Data Fabric, right?","I think, the legacy competitors are in a variety of states of challenge. I think, if you look at the large players like EMC or HP, they\u2019re still trying to rationalize their lead flash portfolio, because none of their products is complete. If you look at players like IBM and Hitachi and Fujitsu and Oracle, they basically conceded and are no longer in sort of new deployment considerations. They\u2019re essentially defending the installed base and the start-ups are challenged.","They have essentially been fast on product innovation, and they don\u2019t have the market reach to compete. So it will be, I see some sense of consolidation coming up in the marketplace and we will benefit from that, because we\u2019re very well-positioned. And it\u2019s a matter of keeping your head down and executing, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much for the detailed clarification.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Jim. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.","Ananda Baruah","Hi, guys. Congrats on the solid results. Hey, if in case I missed it, have you yet begun to see a positive benefit in your all-flash array sales when NAND ASP declines? And then could you just quickly give us an update as you get begin to see inside the cloud data services customers come back to you, kind of almost as you \u2013 well, when we start to see them come back, so obviously I look at your hardware products after getting it safe to cloud data services? Thanks.","George Kurian","On the benefits of NAND price declines, we\u2019ve seen a little bit. I think, you will see the mix shift from hybrid flash to all-flash, right? We have said that as the prices went up, we saw a mix shift towards hybrid disk\/flash system. You\u2019re starting to see the early reversal of that trend back in the all-flash arrays. And I think, over the next few quarters, there\u2019s no question that we see all-flash arrays become a bigger part of our mix.","With regards to the CDS buyers, there are customers that have got our cloud data services in one cloud provider that are looking to now expand it to another cloud provider as a multi-cloud strategy. There are also customers that have started out with workloads in the public cloud that are coming back to an on-premises environment as a complement, right?","So we have seen a range of competitive displacements where we start the dialogue with the customer in the public cloud for used cases like DevOps and ER, that then come back and buy a complementary production environment in their primary data center. So we\u2019re seeing both multi-cloud, as well as on-premise extensions, and we\u2019re excited at the prospect of using CDS to drive our overall portfolio.","Ananda Baruah","Do you think George that can become a \u2013 can become material over time that sort of reference pipeline there?","George Kurian","We\u2019ve said that CDS itself would, in our long-term guide, we said that it would be between $400 million to $600 million on an annual recurring run rate by the end of fiscal 2021, right? So that in if \u2013 in and of itself is a material add to our portfolio. This year, we said it contributes an incremental 100 basis points.","I think that in terms of its strategic value to customers, it is reflective of the fact that we outperforming virtually everybody and virtually every segment we compete in. This idea of a hybrid cloud Data Fabric list all of the pieces of our portfolio in competitive situations.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Ananda.","Ananda Baruah","Thanks so much.","Kris Newton","Next question, please?","Operator","Next question is from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.","Nehal Chokshi","Yes. Thank you and congratulations on great results. That sounds like that was a really massive ELA. Is that \u2013 previously that was the biggest ELAs signed in NetApp\u2019s history?","Ron Pasek","Nehal, it was actually several. That was more than just one. There were probably half a dozen in that number, which is why it\u2019s difficult to predict.","Nehal Chokshi","Okay. And what were the products that were included within that ELA other than the operating systems SKU?","George Kurian","It\u2019s standardizing on our operating system and software. It\u2019s a broad range of offerings. Everything in our portfolio could be bought against that ELA as part of consumption of capacity. So these are strategic agreements to standardize on our Data Fabric. You typically recognize the software component upfront, and there\u2019s a commitment to buying forward capacity and customers consume that capacity over time. So it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re excited, These agreements lift all the elements of our portfolio going forward.","Nehal Chokshi","And that $20 million in run rate in cloud data services, how \u2013 what percent of that came from the ELAs?","George Kurian","None.","Nehal Chokshi","Great.","Kris Newton","All right. Thank you so much. Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.","Simon Leopold","Great. I first wanted to follow-up on the ELA contribution as a \u2013 just to clarify, was that a significant portion of the reason mature products were up 15% year-over-year? You\u2019ve talked a little bit about that, but just want to see if the ELA was a contributor to that? And then in terms of the bigger trending question, I wanted to see how you thought about the use cases for NVMe in that \u2013 one of your competitors talks about a much broader set and claims that most of the market has very narrow use cases. Can you talk about the opportunities and applications that you see for NVMe? Thank you.","Ron Pasek","So none of the ELAs are in mature. There\u2019s really only two things in mature, which is add-on business and OEM. So all of the ELAs are in strategic.","George Kurian","With regards to NVMe, it\u2019s essentially a broad range of used cases, where the customer wants really fast, meaning, very low latency for their applications. The most common ones are high-performance databases. It could be, for example, where somebody wants to go to a shared storage array, rather than using a solution like an Exadata or a database appliance, right? And so that\u2019s why we see the early opportunities to position the solution.","Simon Leopold","And does that include the artificial intelligence that you were talking about? Is that sort of a classic use case?","George Kurian","It could be a service that\u2019s applied to a data-intensive environment like a database or an artificial intelligence \u2013 or a data lake for machine learning. So those are some of the examples.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Simon. Next question?","Operator","The next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Irvin Liu","Hi, this is Irvin Liu dialing in for Amit. Now that you\u2019re in the October quarter. Can you share with us any thoughts on what U.S. federal government budget flush dynamics are going to look like for you, especially given expectations for increased government IT spend in calendar 2018?","George Kurian","We have modeled a fairly typical year-end budget flush for the public sector \u2013 U.S. public sector.","Irvin Liu","Got it. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up then. I have another question about your hardware and software maintenance businesses. You indicated that these businesses shouldn\u2019t be a headwind for you in fiscal 2019. Any thoughts on why maintenance shouldn\u2019t be a contributor to growth, given recent product \u2013 recent quarters of product revenue strength and then you also have a net new revenue stream such as cloud data services coming online?","Ron Pasek","Yes. Irvin, just to be clear, we indicated it would not be a headwind to growth. So it should actually be a contributor as the installed base continues to grow. We just don\u2019t guide that piece discretely.","Irvin Liu","Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s all I had.","Kris Newton","All right. Thank you, Irvin. Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.","Nikolay Todorov","Hi, thanks for taking the question. This Nik Todorov on behalf of Joe. From a strategic point of view, do you see the need to have a composable architecture in your portfolio? And how would you juxtapose that the architecture, which your HCI offering, which I think has some similarities in terms of resource scaling?","George Kurian","Yes. I think, there\u2019s a variety of term. I think, the customers want simplicity of their architecture and they want to be able to, at least, in our belief not to be tied into monolithic scaling of compute and storage, right, that the early vendors in HCI had. And so different people call things differently.","Our solution has many of the elements of composable in it. And so we feel very good about the positioning of our solution. What we have seen with our customer wins is a reflection of the value of that particular aspect of our architecture.","Nikolay Todorov","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Joe. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street.","Eric Martinuzzi","Yes. I want to revisit the buyback. You spent $500 million this quarter on share repurchases. Could you recap there what\u2019s the amount and timeline remaining here?","Ron Pasek","So we have $3.5 billion left to go, and I\u2019m just giving no indication of the timing. As I said at the Analyst Day, I\u2019ll give you how much we repurchased on calls like this after the fact..","Eric Martinuzzi","And then as far as current share price, is this opportunistic purchases or do you have a separate amount for quarter?","Ron Pasek","We\u2019re \u2013 we do opportunistic. We don\u2019t do any accelerated share repurchase. We tend to take advantage of dislocations.","Eric Martinuzzi","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Eric. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners.","Robert Cihra","Hi, thanks very much. Just wondering with flash prices starting to decline again, are you seeing or perhaps what you think your customers are going to do in terms of like elasticity of demand? I mean, do you expect people to buy more capacity now at the \u2013 for the same dollar amount or same capacity at a lower price? Just wondering how you maybe expect that to play out? Thanks.","George Kurian","I think they well clearly shift the mix from hybrid flash systems to all-flash systems. I think that we saw the reverse trend happen as prices went up. So it\u2019s not like people will spend less, they will just spend the project amount and buy more flash as opposed to disc to consume that budget.","Robert Cihra","Okay. But do you think the amount of capacity of flash they buy, does that change, or do you think it\u2019s there, like are they looking for a particular capacity of flash, or a dollar amount of flash, I\u2019m just curious if that helps better?","George Kurian","They \u2013 at least, based on what we saw last year, we saw people have a dollar amount and then buy the capacity associated with that. So they would buy x percentage of flash and y percentage of disk. I think that x was smaller last year than it would be this year. And it will be \u2013 y will be smaller this year than it was last year. So we saw what customers had a project budget and they would spend it and they would optimize the ratio between flash and disk and we see that going in favor of flash for the next several years now.","Robert Cihra","Great, great. Great answer. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Rob. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities.","Erik Suppiger","Yes. Just staying on the flash pricing theme, can you just comment how much pricing has come down in terms of your sale price? And how much you think that could still come down?","George Kurian","We don\u2019t communicate exactly how and when we pass through savings to customers. As I\u2019ve said, we were the first to raise prices in the market and we are not going to be the first to lower prices in the market. We have a differentiated offering and we are looking to maximize the value that we get for our offering. We have done so in the gross margin trajectory on product gross margin this quarter, and you\u2019ll continue to see us stay disciplined on it.","I\u2019m not suggesting that we will never lower the price. But I\u2019m suggesting that we\u2019re not going to be the first to do so. And we monitor the competitive landscape. We monitor what other people are selling, and we\u2019ll make the right choices at the right time.","Erik Suppiger","Do you reduce pricing when you see others that are discounting more aggressively or what prompts you to make the change?","George Kurian","Every deal can be competitive. We will make the right tradeoffs between whether we see this to be a strategic account that we want to capture versus whether this is a broad-based market shift. And it\u2019s called market and comparative intelligence that we are highly disciplined about. We have a very good read on the market. We have a lot of customer interactions that give us that information right.","And so, as I said, we have a clear interest in extracting as much value for our technology as we can. And that value is embedded in the performance and the software capabilities of our systems. And so we\u2019ll be judicious about how we pass through savings to customers. Yes, commodity saving, the philosophy has been that we pass it through, but we can time how we do that.","Erik Suppiger","Very good. Thank you.","Kris Newton","All right. Thank you, Erik. I\u2019ll pass it back to George now for some final remarks.","George Kurian","Thanks, Kris. We delivered a very strong start to the year and introduced substantial innovation across our portfolio, expanding our industry-leading cloud data services and introducing new partnerships, products and solutions to help data-driven organizations thrive.","With our compelling Q1 results and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are off to a strong start in delivering against the long-term model we laid out at our Analyst Day last April. We raised fiscal year 2019 guidance for gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share. We maintain our expectations of mid single-digit revenue growth before any benefit from ELAs, and we continue our strong commitment to shareholder return, evidenced by the 500 million of share repurchases in Q1.","We will introduce more exciting innovations at our Insight User Conference in Las Vegas in October.

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Tara Dhillon. You may begin.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Thank you, Tara. Good afternoon, everyone. NetApp delivered a solid quarter with revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our Americas, European and Asia Pacific geographies all showed healthy growth trends, as did most of our major accounts, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. The only outlier was our U.S. Public Sector, where the typical sequential decline in revenues we see from Q2 to Q3 was exacerbated by lower spending by customers in the defense and intelligence sectors. ","Hard disk drive constraints did have a modest dampening impact on revenue in Q3 although within the balance of what we forecasted. We expect constraints and unpredictability of supply for certain types of drives to continue for a few more quarters, so we will maintain a conservative stance with respect to the impact of hard disk drive supply on both our revenue and gross margin forecast for Q4. ","Our total OEM revenues grew 6% sequentially, while our NetApp branded revenues grew just under 4% sequentially from Q2. Overall performance was on plan with our expectations despite the dynamics around hard disk drive supply and softer U.S. Public Sector performance. Both software entitlements and maintenance revenue and services revenue resumed their typical growth patterns in the quarter. ","Turning now to margin. On our earnings call last quarter, we said we expected to finish Q3 with non-GAAP gross margins around 60% and non-GAAP operating margins around 17%. Actual impact of customer mix, OEM mix and Thailand flooding were all consistent with our forecast. That said, non-GAAP product margins, which reflected these factors came in about $5 million lower than we ultimately expected, in part due to new customer acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP service gross margins declined 40 basis points sequentially rather than rebounding as we had expected, primarily due to several million dollars in costs we absorbed for replacement parts associated with hardware component supplier quality issues. Our non-GAAP operating expenses increased about 2.7% sequentially in Q3, in line with our expectations. The Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 17.4%, returning very close to the 17.5% rate we expect to average for FY '12. ","Our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $4.9 billion in cash and investments. Total deferred revenue increased by $107 million, almost double the net increase in deferred revenue in Q2. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased modestly to 40 days from 38 days in Q2. Inventory improved to 16.5 turns this quarter. Cash from operations of approximately $269 million declined 24% from the same period last year, in part due to the change in DSO but also a decrease in payables of over $30 million associated with one-time integration activities and transition from legacy E-Series contract manufacturers to our own. Free cash flow finished the quarter at $178 million. ","Our diluted share count decreased by about 2 million shares sequentially to about 374 million shares, primarily due to a lower average quarterly share price in Q3. The accounting for the shares associated with our convertible notes and warrants had a modest impact with about 6 million shares associated with the convertible notes included in diluted share count. You may recall that 80% of the convertible notes are hedged. If we were to adjust the share count to reflect the hedge, then non-GAAP EPS would have been about $0.01 higher. You can find the table on our website, which shows the impact on diluted share count for a range of stock prices. ","Now looking forward. Our target revenue range for Q4 is $1.645 billion to $1.725 billion, which at the midpoint implies just under 8% sequential growth and 18% year-over-year growth. We expect consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 59% and non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 17%. We expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 17.5%, bringing our earnings per share estimate to approximately $0.60 to $0.65 per share. ","Diluted share count is projected to increase to about 378 million shares in Q4 based on our average stock price of $39.43 for the first 10 days of the quarter. This will include about 8 million shares from the convertible notes. Recall that the favorable impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset. If we were to adjust the share count for the convertible note hedge, that would add about $0.01 to the EPS guidance. ","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tom for his thoughts. Tom?","Thomas Georgens","Thanks, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Nick described, our results were essentially as expected despite entering the quarter with considerable uncertainty regarding the cost and availability of disk drives. Overall, the business performed well with the only area of weakness being defense-related spending. We saw the bookings growth rate increase over the last quarter as evidenced by an increasing sequential growth rate and an increase in deferred revenue of $107 million, nearly doubling over the last quarter. Of particular importance is the second consecutive quarter of record NetApp branded new customer acquisitions with all-time records in both Storage 5000 and mid-size enterprise. ","Our major accounts have been a drag on revenue growth all fiscal year. But we saw a bit of a rebound this quarter as the major accounts in all geographies other than U.S. Public Sector produced revenue growth in excess of fiscal year-to-date levels. Our multiyear strategy to diversify our coverage model continues to contribute as we generated record sales from indirect channels. ","The federal slowdown also impacted Arrow and Avnet's business. But we were able to offset that with very strong growth in the volume segments with U.S. general territory bookings up over 35% year-over-year and our state local and higher ed bookings up more than 50%. In fact, in November, we won a Partner of the Year Award from CDW.  Similarly, our E-Series OEM business remains very robust. And after 3 quarters, we are now at $509 million in revenue against the $600 million full year target we communicated at the time of the acquisition. ","Looking at product mix. We saw units of our 6000 series increase 2.5x on a year-over-year basis and over 40% sequentially. This is indicative of competitive success on several fronts. First, it shows our strength in performance-oriented workloads, particularly in technical computing and increasingly, in media and entertainment and healthcare. Second, it was aided by a rebound in our major accounts and is evidence of our continued penetration deeper into the enterprise. Last, it is indicative of a greater number of customers rearchitecting their data centers to leverage virtualization. Customers are looking to build infrastructures that are highly efficient, highly automated and highly homogeneous that can run a wide variety of application workloads. ","This is the ideal application of ONTAP, as it is a single architecture that can very effectively serve the widest range of application workloads of any architecture in the industry. For example, this quarter, we had a large take-out win at a financial services firm that was a 100% EMC shop. We prevailed over a V-Max proposal to virtualize and consolidate over 2 dozen separate business units. This is an example of how our compelling value proposition is fueling our momentum in both the private and public clouds and is only further enhanced with the industry-changing clustering capability of our latest release, ONTAP 8.1. ","We refreshed our 2000 series this quarter and saw a 10% sequential increase in units shipped after 3 consecutive quarters of declines. This quarter's reversal was driven partially by the major account improvement, but mostly by the strength of our volume segments. The 3000 remains our biggest revenue contributor and it saw units increased 3% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. Our Alliance Program continues to generate leverage for us as we jointly develop and sell our portfolio of tightly integrated solution offerings in partnership with other best-of-breed vendors. ","FlexPod is a terrific example. This is a modular data center solution developed in conjunction with Cisco to provide partners and customers with an integrated, standardized and scalable infrastructure to support a variety of workloads. Together we offer validated designs for Citrix, VMware, SAP, Red Hat Linux, Microsoft Exchange, SQL Server and SharePoint. We had another outstanding quarter with FlexPod and as a result, our relationship with Cisco and our respective channel partners continues to intensify. ","NetApp greatly expanded its big data solution portfolio during Q3. In the area of analytics, NetApp and Cloudera announced a joint solution based on E-Series to speed and harden enterprise deployments of Apache Hadoop for aggregation and analysis of big data sets. In the area of bandwidth, NetApp announced several new solution portfolios, including a high-performance computing solution with the Lustre file system for government and higher education laboratory environments, as well as our marketing content management solution for media and entertainment and a new seismic processing solution for upstream oil and gas exploration in the energy industries. ","Q3 not only saw the introduction of the latest members of the 2000 family but the latest release of our main operating system, ONTAP 8.1. This is the most impactful step to date in realizing our vision of merging what is already the industry's richest data management capability in a single operating system with the architectural capabilities of clustering. We're able to offer our industry-leading functionality at a level of scale, performance and availability that cannot be matched in the standalone system regardless of size. ONTAP 8.1 is not only well suited for technical applications and the cloud workloads we serve today, but it also expands our reach into large-scale analytics and content repositories frequently called big data. It allows us to expand deeper into mission-critical business applications as well.","The combination of compelling functionality with massive scale is unprecedented in the industry and enables NetApp to provide optimal solutions for the widest range of workloads with a common set of tools, processes and compatible hardware. ONTAP 8.1 represents not only the support of the new 2000 platform and the evolutionary path for tens of thousands of systems running ONTAP 8.0, it substantially increases the workloads where clustering becomes our recommended deployment option. ","On the competitive front, our presence and our relevance has been substantially enhanced as NetApp has grown from $3.9 billion to over $6 billion in 2 years. During this time, we've gone from #4 to a clear #2 market share player in network storage.  Along the way, we have seen the consolidation of many of the smaller competitors by the major industry players. For those businesses acquired by the large server companies, we have not seen a commensurate increase in competitive engagements. We still see much of that volume going into the server vendors' captive customer base, channel partners and service offerings. Elements of these sectors are hard for us to reach, particularly on the low end. And that is why the OEM channel is essential to our strategy. Other parts of the server vendors' installed base are well within our reach as evidenced by the relative market share performance over the last couple of years. ","Conversely, due to our relative size and expansion of our respective portfolios, the competitive engagement with EMC has increased. We compete in our installed base, in their installed base and through a placing common storage of other vendors. Their acquisitions have expanded their portfolio into few traditional NetApp spaces. Similarly, we have been aggressive in targeting legacy CLARiiON, Centera and Celerra takeouts as you would expect. And our 6000 strength is evidence of our competitive wins against the V-Max and other similar frame arrays. ","In summary, our competitiveness remains robust as our FAS unit counts are up substantially, we have record new customer acquisitions and the E-Series OEM business is exceeding expectations. We feel good about our competitive posture today and we are still in the early stages of leveraging both the full innovation of ONTAP 8 as well as the branded E-Series Platform. ","Overall, the third quarter played out much as we forecasted. Bookings were slightly better than expected with revenue and EPS both at our midpoint. The gross margin was slightly less than expected, offset by good discipline on operating expenses. We forecasted mix and drive cost impacts on Q3 gross margins that were more or less in line. However, we saw another 0.5 point, about $5 million of impact on product gross margins partly due to the cost of successfully winning new accounts as well as some other minor factors. Nonetheless, there are a number of moving parts that we will be watching closely. ","We entered the quarter with a great deal of uncertainty regarding disk drive pricing and availability. We knew that it would take some time to consume the inventory and work in progress, so we did not see the full impact of the production loss until January. That proved to be correct. And while the drive vendors had little forward delivery visibility, most of them shipped us drives in excess of their initial estimates. However, not all drive types were universally available and some spot shortages impacted revenue and will likely do so in the upcoming quarter as well. Nonetheless, the teams at NetApp and our drive suppliers worked as aggressively all quarter and the business impact was largely as anticipated in our Q3 guidance. ","Going forward, we expect the drive situation to continue to inject uncertainty into the revenue and gross margins for the next 9 months as availability, cost and pricing settle out in the market. In addition, we also continue to remediate certain customer situations around our vendor component issues as we did in Q3. Historically, we also typically see a seasonal gross margin decline in Q4. So all of these factors combined are driving some conservatism in our gross margin estimates this quarter. ","We are assuming that the macro will remain largely unchanged with no near-term recovery in the defense-related business. However, we are encouraged by the meaningful increase in bookings growth rate in the rest of the Americas and EMEA. In general, we are maintaining a cautious posture until we see more sustainability of the positive trends that we saw in bookings, units and new customer acquisition this quarter. ","Before I open up the call for Q&A, I'd like to congratulate the entire NetApp team for being ranked #6 on FORTUNE'S list of great places to work. The culture at NetApp is one of our keys to our success and this recognition, our fourth consecutive year in the top 10, is evidence of our commitment to create a model company. ","At this point, I'll open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Aaron Rakers from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm going to focus on the Engenio or the E-Series business. I know that you had given a number on the combined year-to-date, $509 million, and I can back into that math. Can you talk a little bit about the branded side of the business, where we stand? I think your initial target was $150 million. And just kind of what's going on there in the branded trajectory of that business?","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I don't have a specific number where we are. But clearly, over the course of the last 2 quarters we have been rolling out a number of solutions. We started with the HPC and the full-motion video solutions. We added the Hadoop and the analytics and some of the other things that I talked about in this call. So I think the solutions are all out, enthusiasm for the products are high. So in terms of the overall numbers and the overall activity levels, I think it's more or less on track. I think from a revenue perspective, the OEM side of the E-Series is clearly ahead of what we had talked about at time of the acquisition. I'd say the branded is probably not on that same trajectory, but clearly, certainly nothing that we're alarmed about at this point because the quoting [ph] level is high, the activity level is high and the solutions are now in the market. And we've actually closed some very, very large transactions. So, so far, so good, I'd say, but still early days.","Operator","The next question comes from Maynard Um from UBS.","Maynard J. Um - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","[indiscernible] the first one. But you talked about the rebound in your major accounts. I'm just wondering...","Maynard J. Um - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, just wondering in terms of the rebound in your major accounts, if you have any sense of how much of that is one-time budget flush versus sort of project-oriented spend. So I guess, the question really is how much visibility there is for the next quarter.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I think in general, I would say that the last 3 weeks of the calendar year were actually pretty strong. So certainly the classic question we get asked once we get past the mid-point of the year is what do we think about at the end of the year budget flush. And in general, I'd say that, that was probably stronger than I thought it was going to be. And that drove a lot of strength in our U.S. -- commercial side of the U.S., and it was mostly as you can well imagine, a large account phenomenon. I think at this particular point, the thing about having a January quarter is that we continue after the euphoria of December with the despair of January. And I think at this point, we just want to kind of see a little bit more into 2012 actual budget cycles. But throughout 2011, we saw all the dynamics that everybody saw. Deals got extended and all that stuff. But it closed out a little bit stronger than I thought. And I think it's probably a little too early to have a read on 2012. But certainly, I would think that the budget flush will at least be a sign of modest confidence. But that's probably as far as I'll go at this point until we get some more data points.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Maynard, this is Nick. The only thing that I would add to that is we have people in many of these accounts because they are big for us. So your question on the fourth quarter, this is our forecast and our guidance for the fourth quarter for these accounts includes a lot of bottom-up forecasting based upon our presence in those accounts and our knowledge on those accounts.","Operator","The next question comes from Shebly Seyrafi from FBN Securities.","Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","The hard disk drive situation is going to go to supply-demand balance supposedly by mid- to early H2 of this year according to WD and others. You're talking about 9 months for a difficult situation for you in disk drives. But do you expect that whenever the situation improves that your product gross margin returns to that 53% level or so you had before the floods?","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I think one of the things about the supply-demand balance is that it doesn't make up any of the supply gap of the prior 6 to 9 months, so I think how that plays out. And the other thing about the supply-demand balance is, I believe, it will be different for different classes of drives. Certainly, the desktop and the mobile, at least from what we hear, we're not consumers of those products, have been hit a bit harder. And the enterprise, while I don't think fulfilled 100% of demand, was certainly a bit better. As far as where we're going to go back, I don't want to give anybody the impression that the disk drive situation is 4 points of gross margin hit. That's not what we forecasted. The 63 points, you need to go back and also adjust for the OEM business that we didn't have last year, and likewise, the OEM business being bigger than we anticipated, which is a good thing. So I think the guidance we gave, I believe, for this quarter is that in the vicinity of 1 point margin hit as the result of the disk drives. And I think that's more or less where it is. So we don't certainly want to over-attribute anything else to that. I think that's what we expected, that's what we saw. But the one thing I would point out is I still think it's a little bit fluid in the market in terms of pricing and how that's translated to street pricing. So certainly, we've seen a lot of players, ourselves included, raise list prices. But the street pricing is still somewhat more fluid. I don't think that's settled out yet. So I still think the next 3 to 6 months, and then 9 months, I still think we'll be talking about making up previous supply. But next 3 to 6 months, we should see some settling out of the drive side and kind of know where it will be.","Operator","The next question comes from Deepak Sitaraman from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, just a clarification for Nick. Nick, is the $5 million impact on product gross margins that you called out due to new customer acquisitions, do you expect that to be an ongoing cost of business going forward? And then relative to your gross margin guidance of 59% for the April quarter, what are you assuming for product gross margins? Can you maybe talk a little bit about the puts and takes there in terms of mix versus the hard drive impact versus the pricing environment?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Sure, Deepak. Yes, let me just walk you through those couple of points. So in terms of the Q4 guidance, why don't I start there for a second? We actually would expect to have some benefit to product gross margins from a change in mix, right? In the third quarter, we talked about a negative on the mix side of the fence. So you're going to have a partial offset to that in our fourth quarter, think of the OEM business and those types of things that have a heavier end of calendar year revenue stream. The offset to that is in our fourth quarter, generally, we see a higher discounting level, right? So they basically offset each other. So the product gross margin that you see in the results here for Q3 is not that far off of what you should expect for Q4. In terms of that customer acquisition cost that were built into the Q3 actual results, again, that's part of the guidance that we put together for Q4. And if there's anything important there to call out, we'll let you know that at that time.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I think if you ask me the question, \"Do we want a lot of new customer acquisition?\" I think the answer to that is yes. And I think the $5 million, I think that's a factor. We also had relatively minor, but we're talking about $5 million here, of FX impact this quarter that was negative on the revenue side, which I'm sure will flow through the gross margin. That's a few million dollars. So $5 million has a few causes, and eventually, you start crossing it relatively thin. But the simple fact of the matter is we have now 2 quarters, a very, very strong momentum in new customer acquisition. Some of it is driven by in response to the concentration that we saw earlier in the year. So a fair amount of new customer acquisition is actually a new vertical for us, and that's been a big focus. We see the media and entertainment and healthcare as factors there as well. So trying to continue to expand our customer base, and it's good to see the momentum now 2 quarters in a row. And if $5 million is the price we pay, then I think we'd be glad to pay it.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Alexander from Raymond James.","Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I guess, a follow-up. Do you think there's a permanent change in your gross margin structure for your branded business that's being caused by a step-up in customer acquisition that could actually escalate beyond the 50 basis point impact this quarter and become larger?","Thomas Georgens","If that's the reason, then I think that would be a very, very strong long-term payoff for us. When I think about gross margin, I think we got a couple of things to play. Clearly, we have to drive pricing. We have the OEM mix being higher than expected. I think we want a full year cycle out of that business, so we understand what it means to us. Clearly, the unit mix moving to the high end is impactful. I mean, clearly, we had a gigantic jump in the 6000 units. And then the Public Sector component as being smaller in the mix. So I think there's a few moving parts here. So I guess, in my prepared commentary, I said that we want to really take a close look at this. Some of these trends are positive for us as a company, but they're also impacting the gross margin. So I think we really want to get another 90 days in front of us get one full cycle of the OEM business, another quarter of visibility to drive pricing, understand the unit mix and how stable that is. And I think from there, we'll probably have more company [ph] commentary on gross margin. That's kind of the way I would see it.","Operator","The next question comes from Jayson Noland from Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the HDD price increase, I believe that was early February. Tom, did you see any business get pulled into FQ3? And how sticky do you think that price increase will be? I know it's been pretty much uniform across the industry.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I think the -- I don't know whether it's just us, but price increases are not something that we do very often. And there's a lot of complexity. Let's not lose our grip on what we've done. We've basically raised list prices, right? And that's what we've done. In terms of how that translates, we certainly have customers with contracts with contractual price takedowns. We have OEM agreements that's got to have pricing in them -- the price increases that we give to our channel partners have got a 30-day effectivity date. We've got quotes outstanding that is up to us whether we choose who we want to honor them or not. So simply raising the prices -- I mean, the street price goes up. Otherwise, we would've all raised prices 10 years ago. So I think the flow-through of the street price also is a function of burning off and remedying some of these other situations. So the list price, I think that most of the industry has raised prices, but I think the street price is still very volatile yet.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then any pull-forward into FQ3?","Thomas Georgens","Okay, I could cut the follow-up questions. But that's a hard thing to say. Since we are honoring quotes, I would say most likely not.","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Reitzes from Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Tom, you spoke a lot about public. But can you talk a little more about Europe? I think that probably exceeded most people's expectations, at least ours. And it seemed like it got back to some pretty good growth. And obviously, that's the area everybody's worried about. And I think it was a little light last quarter. So what changed there? And what are you seeing into the next?","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I think one of the things that we've had in the past, although it's been pretty constant this quarter, was since we didn't ship all the revenue that we had, sometimes there's a little revenue distortion. But the bottom line, if you go back to pure bookings, the bookings growth rate across all of NetApp was up this quarter from last quarter and Europe as well. And clearly, the German economy still appears to be robust. It still appears to be strong. As far as the Southern Europe goes, it's not a large market share place for us. So my response usually is when you don't have any market share, the macro is not that important. But overall, I think the European business and the major geos has held up for us reasonably well. And currency was kind of a headwind that they also had to contend with. So I think we're all pretty much pleased with the EMEA performance. And frankly, outside of this fence-related activity, the U.S. performance booking as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just asking the question, I guess, on the competitor front. It appears you and EMC are going up more and more against each other as you both seem to be expanding your product offerings. I'm curious. Do you worry in the long term? And do you sense that pricing may actually start to get more aggressive due to this? And at least, when you look at your new customer additions you've had, I'm curious if you can talk about what percent of those wins you think have come from EMC displacements versus several OEM displacements?","Thomas Georgens","I think -- I mean, we could talk about pricing theory whether when the pricing becomes more disruptive, when there are a lot of players or when there were 2 major players. EMC is relatively disciplined and so are we, I think for the most part. So I wouldn't expect anything really dramatic, although I do believe that there's some unsettling of pricing in the market right now, which I think will be temporary. I think going forward, clearly, as all products become more mature and we go deeper into the data center. Clearly, that's their stronghold. Clearly, they've done acquisitions where they compete with us more. So I think we knew this battle was coming. And frankly, as we see the industry, I think that there are really 2 players. If you look at the market share growth over time and really, they've been a share gainer, primarily inorganic. NetApps has been a share gainer as well, primarily organic, although clearly we added to that this year. And I think over time, they and us, clearly are going to have the ability to continue to invest and continue to innovate. So I think as time goes on, ultimately, I think the 2 of us are going to be the share gainers and are going to be the key players in this industry. And I think we should only expect to see that more and more.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'm sorry. Could you just talk about the new wins that you had? How much of the dealings came from EMC displacements versus the server windows getting displaced possibly?","Thomas Georgens","I'd say -- well, in some cases, it doesn't matter because usually when we're competing to displace the server vendors, EMC is the alternative that we're competing with. But we certainly have -- clearly, I'd say 3, 4 years ago, most of it was us and them competing for server vendors business. But at this point in time, I think a lot more direct competition between us and them and our respective installed bases. Clearly, them competing on the NAS side and us competing on the SAN side, deeper in the enterprise. So I don't really know the answer to your question, but it's increasingly EMC. But in any case, we typically compete with them either way.","Operator","The next question comes from Rajesh Ghai from ThinkEquity.","Rajesh Ghai - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","So if I look at your growth rate over the past 2 quarters for the core business, excluding Engenio, it's been in the 7% to 9% range. And if I look at your guidance and take the high end of the range, looking at a growth rate of 8% for the core business, assuming $180 million for the Engenio business. So the question is that looking ahead, is this the kind of growth rate we should expect for NTAP, which is very close to the market growth rate? And if not, what gets it higher?","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I'd say probably that estimate for the OEM business is probably a little high, simply because I'm guessing is for the quarter that just passed will probably be their high-water mark. And one of the other things that we tried to put out in the prepared text is when we look at our bookings growth rate, clearly it translates into revenue growth rate. But the other thing it does is, it also translates into an increase in the deferred revenue balance on the balance sheet. So depending on the nature of the deals and contracts and ELAs and things of that nature, the revenue growth rate clearly is as you quote. But we also had a remarkably strong growth in our deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet. And I think that it's kind of the combination of those 2 is probably indicative of what our bookings actually look like. So in terms of new wins and our actual booking growth rate, it's still on a multiple to market growth rate. And over time, clearly, the deferred revenue will flow back through and the bookings and the revenue will normalize. But right now, we're seeing a spread between the revenue growth rate and the deferred revenue growth rate. In fact, deferred revenue growth rate, I think, has been up 20% plus every quarter this year. And last year, I think it averaged 15%. So overall, I think that the bookings remain robust. The translation to revenue in the near-term clearly has not been quite as high, but you should also see the deferred revenue as a proxy for our winning rates.","Operator","The next question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Georgens","No. I wouldn't want it to be -- that we've signaled in any way that we were supply-constrained on that product because I don't think we were. So I wouldn't concur with that. Clearly, we've seen a very, very substantial uptick in demand for that product in the first quarter with availability. I believe that at this point, bookings of the new product have surpassed the bookings of the product that it's replacing. So I think the momentum is good, but I don't believe we've had an availability issue. Maybe there's different words around that. But I think from the factory, the product has been available on our normal lead time. So I don't think that, that's been an issue. In terms of where the demand is coming from, one of the demand areas for the small products or the 2000 family, interestingly, enough has actually been on the DoD side. And their slowdown has impacted the volumes in that area all the year long. So in terms of where the uptick in demand is coming from, it's almost all coming from the general territory area. So it's mostly gone through our channel partners. But I'll take that as feedback as a perception of availability. But certainly from our perspective, those things have been on normal lead times and have been available.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Pacific Crest Securities.","Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Tom, really just trying to get a better grasp on the rebound of the business. Clearly, DoD had a drag this quarter. But U.S. commercial up 11% sequentially, EMEA, up 23% sequentially. I think that's the highest sequential growth in Europe in a little over a year. How much of the rebound you're seeing outside of the DoD would you attribute to just seeing budget flush versus some of the share gains that you have or frankly just some of the major accounts are coming back? Again, trying to gauge the rebound we saw and really how sustainable it is going forward.","Thomas Georgens","In my prepared commentary, I tried to go after that as well and said we clearly saw some positive things, and not just the rebound of the big accounts. We saw obviously an explosion in units of all types. It wasn't like one cannibalizing another, but 2000, 3000, 6000 is all up sequentially in a meaningful way, particularly the 6000 and the 2000. We certainly saw improvement in the major accounts, but we also saw new customer acquisition very, very strong as well. So all things considered, I think that there are a number of positive data points this quarter. But obviously, one point doesn't make a trend. Now new customer acquisition has been strong now 2 quarters in a row. And that's good. I think clearly, we'd love to convince ourselves that while the macro is different today than it was a few years back, but a few years back was our biggest new customer acquisition years. And that basically was a very, very strong precursor to the future growth. So at this point, I'm certainly not going to go out on a limb and predict it. I'm just saying is that the new customer acquisition and our efforts to diversify our customer base, particularly into some new verticals appears to be paying off. And I think that part we're excited about, and we'd love to see that continue.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz from JPMorgan.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Nick, I wanted to see if you can help us out in terms of understanding some of these new acquisition costs around the customer momentum, also the smart decisions initiative that's been undertaken recently. How should we think about the OpEx or the shape of the OpEx growth trajectory for the next couple of quarters? Will there be any sort of spikes there?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Mark, no, I don't think you should think about that on the OpEx side of the fence. I think what we've built in was on the margin side, some new customer acquisition costs that is built into the gross margins. Frankly, in terms of the guidance and the ranges, we've got some frankly conservatism built in so that we could cover some of that. On the OpEx side of the fence, we've given you, again, a specific guidance range here that you could back into. That's not inconsistent with the prior quarters. So I would not expect to see a big kick-up in OpEx at this point in time for those types of things.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. Also we're rolling into our Q1, which is obviously the most challenging quarter we have. And that usually isn't a quarter that allows for a wide range of OpEx envelope. So in terms of the new customer acquisition, a couple of things about that. Usually, although we are seeing bigger first-time ever transactions with customers -- and I think part of that we're seeing in the 6000. Usually first-time transactions with customers usually involve knocking out the incumbent and they tend not to be large deals. And that's why the new customer acquisition is costly. It's not so much costly from an OpEx perspective so much as it's costly from a gross margin perspective. In terms of the launch, that was really around the 2000 and really getting the channel ready, getting all the training programs out there, getting all the pricing out there. So I think that the bulk of that spending occurred earlier in the quarter and the end of the prior quarter as opposed to this quarter. So you'll see the normal things at the end of the year. You'll see the commissions pick up and all the other things that happen in a typical Q4. But I would expect us to, as we enter Q1, to not be that aggressive on the OpEx side.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray.","Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just had a question on 8.1. Is it fair to assume that the early adopters of 8.1 will be your major accounts since the larger NetApp deployments should stand to benefit the most from Cluster-Mode? And then is there a professional services revenue opportunity if those customers just migrate from non-Cluster-Mode to Cluster-Mode?","Thomas Georgens","In the Cluster-Mode, interestingly enough, it's not always new customers. I'm sorry, it's not always existing customers. It's a balance of the 2. But there's no doubt that our existing customers have been hearing this story for a long time, and they've been testing with 8.0 and into 8.1. So it's clearly a lot more activity there, but we actually have some brand-new, new-to-NetApp accounts that are jumping into the story with 8.1. So in terms of professional services on the migration, I would say yes. But I won't think it's going to be meaningful to our overall numbers. And the reason being is if they're existing customers and they're migrating, clearly, we want to enable them to make this migration and they will make this migration successful. And so basically trying to turn that into a revenue opportunity for ourselves probably is not in the spirit of partnership. So we'll probably do some activity. We certainly aren't going to do work for free. But on the other hand, I wouldn't consider that a revenue generator. We want to see people successful deployed or give them the help that they need, but we're not going to try to extract a price for it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Ader from William Blair.","Jason Ader - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Tom, do you guys have a view on server-side Flash along with what EMC is doing and others? Do you guys have a plan there? And what's your overall view on the potential uptake in the market for that type of solution?","Thomas Georgens","Well, thanks. And what I appreciate is after a year of being asked about SSD is that now we're back on the subject that really matters, which is Flash. First of all, Flash is going to be pervasive. And I think you're going to see it everywhere in the infrastructure simply because of the economics compared to alternatives of the payback that it has. But when I think about this odyssey over the last couple of years, we sat through the competition crowing about just replacing hard drives with solid-state drives and not impacting the softwares at all. And we're very, very clear that while that's an interesting niche market, that's not really where this technology would be optimally deployed. And our position all along has been that Flash as a cache is where it has the most impact. And I would say that we actually see probably more pervasive deployment of Flash in our systems than anybody else in the industry. And I think it's been a big part of our growth in the 6000, which is exploding. It's an every unit item. The other thing we said about Flash is that we saw systems in the long run to just be Flash and ATA. That the need for enterprise drives and hence, tiering software and all of those things would ultimately go away as well. But effectively, from an I\/O per second performance, the difference between Flash and a rotating drive is so great, that trying to match those 2 different drives, the rotating drive doesn't make any sense. And now we've seen the competition talking primarily about Flash as a cache and talking about one drive type. So I think, all along, our view is I don't think we kind of conformed to the conventional wisdom on this. I think we've been an outlier all along. We've been asked about this on a lot of calls. But in the end, I think, I've been pretty clear with the strategy that we went on in our execution. So if you have a question on Flash on the host, I think that's a sure thing. For all the reasons that we're putting Flash in the disk array, I think people are going to put Flash on their host for performance enhancement. But from NetApp's perspective, I don't think the opportunity is simply selling cards into the host, and we may do that. But our real goal here is that we want to bring the data that's stored in Flash on the host into our data management methodology for backup and replication and deduplication and all of those things. And that's our focus. So you'll hear more from us on that dimension, but it isn't as simple. We're going to make a PCI Flash card, the software component and bringing that into our broader data management capability is really what our focus is here.","Operator","The next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Brean Murray.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Tom, just interested to get your thoughts on pent-up demand as we go through this year and, I guess, into calendar '13. The drive companies have been pretty up -- have pretty publicly talked about their belief that a good portion of, I guess, of the capacity, sort of demanded will not be met this year and there will be, I guess, a good backlog going into next year. And just want to get your thoughts on it. And I guess, what impact that might have on seasonality as we get into the second half of the year?","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I would be careful about parsing that statement one step further and that is, I think that meeting demand differs by drive category. And I think that the mobile and the desktop are in a little bit different category than enterprise drives and high-end ATA drives. And while I'm certainly not an expert on that segment, I think that the amount of aggregate demand in the enterprise space that was met last quarter was probably higher than where it was in the other spaces. So while it's still tight -- and I don't think that all of the demand in our sector has been satisfied. And certainly, we did leave revenue behind last quarter as we said we would and we probably will again next quarter. I wouldn't factor into your plans that there's some 20% or 30% unsatisfied demand that's going to come crashing down in the second half. That may be true of other sectors, but I don't think it's necessarily true of this one.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes. And as Tom indicated, last quarter, when we gave guidance that we expected not only a cost implication [indiscernible] as expected. But we expected revenue softness from it, which is also pretty much in line with our guidance range. We've built that similar type of both cost and top line challenging dynamic into our Q4.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Marshall from ISI Group.","Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Obviously, there has been some concerns of share lots [ph] that in some of the new mid-range platforms out there, namely VNX. The company had a couple of difficult quarters, but it seems as though things are kind of on the rebound here. Can you talk a little bit about how much these results and guidance just kind of indicative of perhaps the eval period for some of these newer competitive platforms getting over and those orders are now finally coming back home to NetApp?","Thomas Georgens","I'm not quite sure if that's the dynamic. I think frankly, if you look at our business all year long, the major accounts have been pretty much what this conversation has come back to the last 2 quarters. Beyond that, the general territory, the broader geographies, the rest of the business has all been very, very, very strong. And so for us, I think it's been a little bit more of a major account story, financial services in the first quarter. And clearly, we've got Department of Defense now. But once you carve those out, the business isn't substantially different from where we want to be. So I think the major accounts have been more of a swinger than any individual competitive dynamic. And I think one of the overlays that we've had, particularly after the first quarter, was the desire to diversify our base a bit. And I think that the new customer acquisition is important. So if I look at the NetApp story, the major accounts have rebounded, but they're still hardly robust. The rest of the business has actually been pretty strong. And I think we're setting the stage for the future with relatively strong new customer acquisition. But I would say that the kind of the ebb and flow of the major accounts has probably been the biggest ever between this quarter and last quarter rather than any type of competitive activity.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Tom, I wanted to ask you a question if I could going back to 8.1. Is there a notion of an upgrade cycle here? Will you see customers use 8.1 and say mixed environments? Or is it going to be new workloads that deploy? And what I'm really trying to ask is how should investors think about 8.1 on the impact of product growth rates?","Thomas Georgens","Well, 8.x is basically the platform of the next decade of innovation. So to kind of put into the context of quarter-to-quarter impact, I want to be careful of that. What 8.1 represents is we're going to be recommending 8.1 for more -- and more and the clustering capability of 8.1 for more and more and more workloads as we go forward. So I think that there are some customer workloads that tend to be enormously performance-intensive. That will move to the clustering capability when they think they can support their environments. I would say that for most of the rest of them that I would expect to see Cluster-Mode actually go out in new greenfield opportunities and new applications as opposed to clustering what they already have in place, unless they have a very, very key performance issue like some of our scientific and technical customers and moviemaking and things of that nature. So how that translates into units? I'm not really sure. I also think that this is not a trivial technology. This isn't just one more feature. This is a fundamentally different way of dealing with this issue. So we had a major bank in here not that long ago, and there are a large number of frame arrays, and the frame arrays are all well and good until you span one. So you have a need that's bigger than one, you have to migrate data. But it's pretty clear that the discussion that clustering is a far superior solution to that problem because it's basically scales indefinitely. And that's a really, really powerful story. I could think of another story with another bank, as it turns out. And we're having a long discussion about their concerns about moving in this direction, not necessarily 8.1 but just moving away from what they have. And I said, \"It's clear that you don't want to do this. So why -- what's driving this conversation?\" And his answer was that, \"When I look at the capabilities that you guys have, the deduplication, the application integration, the ease-of-use, the data movement, the data migration, the thin provisioning and all of that stuff, I don't have that on my frame array. And I'm never going to get it. And that's why this stuff is so interesting. So if you can resolve the performance and the scalability issues and deliver to me all that functionality, I'd be very, very interested.\" So those decisions aren't going to get made overnight, Keith. When they get made and when we have momentum and when we have the proved cases of all of that type of stuff, there is a fundamentally different way of doing storage for the enterprise. And I think it's going to be massively impactful. So whether it pays off in this quarter or next quarter, which really is fundamentally different, nobody is going to be able to merge this level of functionality with this level of scale. And that's what the 8.0 journey is all about. And 8.1 represents a case where clustering is now available for a very, very large amount of -- combined with a very, very large amount of the rest of our functionality. And I will be recommending it for more and more workloads.","Operator","The next question comes from Glenn Hanus from Needham & Company.","Glenn Hanus - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Maybe could you comment a little on the potential for operating margin expansion as we -- for the fiscal '13 year in light of perhaps the product gross margins might be a little bit lighter for a couple of quarters? How are you thinking about scaling the OpEx next year and the potential for operating margin expansion for fiscal '13?","Thomas Georgens","I think for the next 6 months, the operating margin story is going to be the gross margin story. And the decision was that while we're in the midst of perhaps some temporary disruption in pricing as a result of the drives, that we were not going to whipsaw operating expense in search of some model and [indiscernible] falls out. So when we have a full cycle of OEM mix, now we've got a major what appears to be a change in the mix of our units, so we need to figure out whether that's sustainable over 1 quarter or a 6-month phenomenon. So over the next 6 months, I think we're going to be cautious for OpEx because clearly, the operating margin has come down and we're heading into Q1. But I would say for the next 6 months that we're not going to turn the OpEx knob very hard to try and meet a target if the gross margin is going to be volatile due to one-time events. I think in the second half of the year after we get through the next 3 to 6 months, we're going to have more visibility and we're going to have a stronger opinion on that.","Operator","There's time for one last question. The final question comes from Chris Whitmore from Deutsche Bank.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on Keith's question around the potential for an upgrade cycle but come at this from the 10-gig networking space. A lot of the networking vendors are pretty optimistic about a spending cycle being driven in part by Romley and increasing adoption of 10 gig in a lot of data centers. Do you see that as a driver for your business as we move forward?","Thomas Georgens","Well, we've been 10-gig capable for a while. And sometimes within the data center, we get to see obviously much more of these high bandwidth links than you see more generally within the enterprise. So if basically this is going to be a part of a rearchitecting of the data center to take advantage of virtualization -- and clearly that's the trend that we see, is that the virtualization trend was key. And we get asked a lot about how far that's along. I think the real trend is how many people have really redesigned their data center to take advantage of what virtualization is and build a big shared infrastructure capable of running many apps that's highly automated, highly efficient. What people would call -- we call it shared virtual infrastructure or the private cloud. I think those are all factors. One thing that 10 gig does that, I think, plays to our strength is that it will enhance NFS performance. And when we first pursued the VMware business, our business there was 90% SAN. Now what we see in VMware is it's roughly 50-50. So clearly more and more customers are seeing the capabilities of NFS. And if that's going to enhance NFS performance, not only in the data center but even more broadly, then clearly that would play to our strength.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Eric. I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Kris, you may begin.","Kris Newton","Hello, and thank you for joining us on our Q2 fiscal year '14 earnings call. With me today are CEO, Tom Georgens; and our CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com, along with the earnings release, our financial tables, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We described some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on an 8-K. A detailed discussion of these reasons is included in our risk factors, included in our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Q reports, also on file with the SEC and available on our website, all of which are incorporated by reference into today's discussions.","All numbers discussed today are GAAP unless stated otherwise. To see the reconciling items between the non-GAAP and GAAP, you may refer to the tables in our press release or on our website.","In a moment, Nick will walk you through some additional color on our financial results, and then Tom will walk you through his perspective on the business this quarter.","I'll now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We delivered a number of positives in Q2, including strong non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin, both of which underscore the resiliency of our business model, as well as EPS over the high end of our previous guidance range. However, we are disappointed with our overall Q2 revenue performance. The continued, uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, combined with the U.S. federal government shutdown and larger-than-expected decline in our OEM business, impacted our top line revenue growth. As a result, total revenue came in $10 million below our previous guidance range.","Despite the conservatism we built into our Q2 guidance to account for uncertainty in U.S. federal business related to sequestration and looming budget deadlines, we did not predict the degree to which sequestration, combined with the government shutdown, would impact our ability to close business in our pipeline. In addition, though we expected OEM business to be down in Q2, ordering patterns from our largest partners were off plan, reflecting their exposure to market dynamics.","Net revenue for the quarter of $1.55 billion was up 2% sequentially and up 1% from Q2 of last year. Branded revenue was 90% of our overall revenue and, at $1.4 billion, was up 5% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. OEM revenue continued to decline in Q2 and was down 28% from Q2 last year and 9% from last quarter. Indirect revenues through the channels and OEMs accounted for 83% of Q2 revenue. Arrow and Avnet contributed 23% and 16% of net revenue, respectively.","From a geographic perspective, our Americas Commercial and EMEA revenues were up 3% and 2%, respectively, versus Q2 last year. U.S. Public Sector revenue was down 8% versus last year, the largest year-over-year decline in the business we've seen in a Q2 since we began tracking it in fiscal year 2007. Finally, Asia-Pacific revenue was flat on a year-over-year basis and down 2% sequentially, continued evidence of macroeconomic pressure in that geography as well.","Non-GAAP gross margin of 63.6% was well above our guidance range and benefited from particular strength in product gross margin. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 57.3% was at its highest rate in 9 quarters, illustrating our strong competitive position and driven primarily by more highly configured systems and favorable mix. Non-GAAP service gross margin of 58.9% was over a point better than last year but down slightly from Q1.","Our non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 17.5%, over 3 points better than last year and over a point above our previous guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were essentially flat as a percentage of revenue and flat year-over-year. Versus Q1, non-GAAP operating expenses were up 2%, reflecting run rate benefits from our realignment activities and prudent expense management, given the macro environment.","Consistent with our previous guidance, Q2 diluted share count of 349 million shares decreased by approximately 11 million shares sequentially, primarily related to the full quarter benefit of repurchase activity in Q1. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.66 was up 29% from Q2 last year and exceeded the high end of our previous guidance range by $0.01.","Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and investments. Days sales outstanding at 35 and inventory at 20 turns reflect continued strong operational performance. Deferred revenue of $2.9 billion was essentially flat versus Q1 but up $162 million versus Q2 of last year. Cash from operations was approximately $363 million, an increase of 8% from Q2 of last year, and free cash flow was 21% of revenue.","In Q2, we spent $150 million in share repurchases as well as $51 million in a cash dividend. As expected, we successfully completed the first $1 billion of our $3 billion share repurchase program in September. We remain on track to complete the second $1 billion of the program by the end of May 2014, consistent with our original guidance. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.15 per share of the company's stock to be paid on January 22, 2014.","Separately, the warrants associated with the convertible notes that we retired this past June were exercised in September and October. For the quarter, the warrants increased diluted share count by just over 1 million shares. All settlements associated with the retired convertible notes and related hedges and warrants are now behind us.","Now to our fiscal Q3 guidance. We remain well positioned in our business but must assume that the challenging macro environment will continue. Our target revenue range for Q3 is $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion which, at the midpoint, implies 5% sequential growth but flat revenue versus Q3 last year. We expect year-over-year branded revenue growth at just under Q2 levels and OEM revenue to begin to normalize but be very sensitive to demand from our partners. We expect consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 61.5% to 62% and non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 18%. Further, we expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain relatively constant as we enter the back half of fiscal year. Based on our repurchases in the first 10 days of the quarter, we expect our diluted share count for Q3 to remain flat at approximately 350 million shares. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q3 to range from approximately $0.68 to $0.73 per share, up from $0.67 last year. Recall that EPS last year included a $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate resulting from reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in January.","As we move into the second half of the year, we continue to expect macro uncertainty, which may intensify due to U.S. government challenges. That said, we believe we are well positioned to execute through these challenges. Our expectations around margins and EPS growth for fiscal 2014 remain unchanged. So ultimately dependent on revenue mix and growth, we are reiterating our expectations for approximately 61% non-GAAP gross margin and approximately 17% non-GAAP operating margin for the year. We continue to expect full year EPS growth in the mid-teens from operations and further supplemented by our capital allocation activity. We completed the first $1 billion of stock repurchases in September, 2013 and are on track to complete the second $1 billion by the end of May 2014, consistent with our original plan. At this point, I will turn the call over to Tom for his thoughts. Tom?","Thomas Georgens","Thanks, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Nick said, our OEM and U.S. federal businesses clearly presented a headwind, resulting in a shortfall to our revenue guidance, but other aspects of our business performed well in Q2. We remain confident in our competitive position as we produced very strong gross margins and continued to gain share with branded revenue growth of 5% year-over-year, well ahead of any of our major competitors. The robust gross margin, combined with prudent expense management, enabled us to deliver better-than-expected operating margin and EPS just over the high end of our previous guidance range.","We are focused on delivering innovative best-of-breed solutions that are cloud-integrated and flash-accelerated. These solutions create a compelling value for our customers, which ultimately enables NetApp to gain share and deliver shareholder value. Customers are increasingly adopting our latest innovations and are confident that our strategy will enable them to navigate the future. We offer a differentiated approach to cloud and software-defined storage and have established leadership positions in key emerging areas, such as flash and converged infrastructure.","During the quarter, we outlined our strategy to deliver cloud data management that spans both public and private clouds. As IT organizations attempt to keep pace with rapidly changing business demands, the move to integrate cloud offerings with on-premise IT resources is inevitable. This introduction of the cloud makes data governance even more complex. Data ONTAP, the #1 storage operating system, is uniquely positioned to integrate data management across hybrid on- and off-premise environments by providing data management and a common storage fabric. Clouds using ONTAP can efficiently connect with on-premise and other ONTAP-based clouds to move data and workloads easily, utilizing NetApp's data movement and portability technologies. This supports our customers, as they evolve their IT strategies and organizations from builders and operators to brokers of services across multiple cloud providers.","Additionally, in Q2, we announced more cloud partnerships, expanding on our technology and cloud service provider ecosystem. We deepened the integration with Oracle's cloud-enabling software, so that customers can more easily and effectively manage their data across public and private cloud environments. We're at the core of Orange business system's flexible computing solution. With over 35 petabytes of NetApp storage, Orange now offers its customers superior availability and security.","We also announced a strategic collaboration with Verizon to re-architect traditional cloud-based storage models using Data ONTAP in a virtual machine running on top of their hardware. Our partnership with Amazon Web Services continues to be strong, with tremendous customer interest and a growing number of partners building service offerings on NetApp Private Storage for AWS. With our partner ecosystem that helps connect on-premise infrastructure with cloud resources growing by the day, we offer customers more choice, simpler deployment options and enhanced functionality as they move to a hybrid IT environment.","Software-defined storage is the next step in the evolution of virtualization and cloud architectures. It is based on the core tenet that resources are defined in software, managed through policies and available on a broad range of hardware. We pioneered this value proposition with Data ONTAP as our customers can manage data on all hardware, other vendors' hardware and on commodity hardware. Our leadership in software-defined storage now includes increased investments for hyperscale cloud service environments, more robust quality of service capabilities and expanded API integrations with emerging solutions like OpenStack and CloudStack.","The momentum of clustered Data ONTAP remains strong. In Q2, we shipped more than 1,900 clustered nodes, an increase of almost 300% from Q2 a year ago and almost 60% from last quarter. 37% of high-end systems and 24% of mid-range systems were deployed in cluster configurations. In Q1 of this year, we introduced Data ONTAP 8.2, which makes it easier for our installed base to migrate and reap the benefits of clustered ONTAP. More than half of the controllers migrated from 7-mode to clustered ONTAP have occurred since ONTAP 8.2's introduction. Additionally, new customer acquisitions driven by clustered ONTAP accelerated in Q2.","We also see strong adoption of our broad-portfolio of flash solutions, which enable customers to deploy the right level of performance, efficiency and scalability for their specific needs and workloads. Since the inception of our flash program, we have shipped over 60 petabytes of flash, almost 1\/3 of which is in the form of all-flash arrays. The attach rate of our Flash Cache and Flash Pool solutions remains consistently high at approximately 60% from mid-range and high-end systems. In Q2, we shipped 6 petabytes of flash as a cache, accelerating just over 0.5 exabyte of storage.","In Q1, we began shipping Flash Accel, our software that combines application integration and enterprise data management with the performance capabilities of host-side flash. We are seeing strong customer interest with customers in varying stages of qualification. Our all-flash array, the EF540, is also seeing robust customer traction with more than 200 units shipped in Q2. Soon, we will introduce the next generation of the EF product line with improved capacity, bandwidth and performance.","In addition to strong growth of the all-flash EF540, we continue to see growth in the total branded E-Series product line. Unit shipments of branded E-series more than doubled year-over-year. Compared to Q2 a year ago, the FAS2000S and 6000s were down slightly and the FAS3000 units grew 15%. Across the board, we would have seen better growth in unit shipments had our federal business performed to expectations. We have a clear positioning of our FAS for shared infrastructure and E-series for dedicated workloads. By targeting unique and nonoverlapping segments, we continue to be best positioned to meet a broad range of customer requirements with the least amount of complexity. We believe that the majority of enterprise demand will be met through integrated solutions, customer's value integration as evidenced by the converged solutions in general and FlexPod specifically.","FlexPod has been available for 3 years now, and we are seeing tremendous growth and success around the globe. In conjunction with Cisco, we have expanded the FlexPod offerings to include FlexPod data center, a single flexible architecture for enterprise workloads, FlexPod Express for small to midsized organizations and FlexPod Select for dedicated high-performance workloads. The FlexPod customer base has more than doubled from Q2 a year ago to almost 3,300. It is available in 84 countries, delivered by greater than 90 channel partners with 50 validated architectures. Clustered ONTAP deployments also represented 45% of our FlexPod business in Q2. Our focus on the customer and our decision to deliver the most cost-effective and flexible solution on the market has resulted in FlexPod's #1 position in integrated infrastructure as recognized by IDC.","For the past year, we've talked about the challenging environment in which we are operating. The macro economy is uncertain and may get worse due to U.S. government dynamics. Unfortunately, I do not see any near-term resolution, and our guidance reflects what we believe is an appropriate level of conservatism. Nonetheless, we are well positioned, and we expect to continue to gain share regardless of the environment. Customers play significant importance on our ability to provide value through integration and the expansion of that value beyond the single data center into the hybrid cloud. Our ability to marry on-premise storage with cloud resources across hypervisors makes this hybrid cloud a reality. NetApp is at the forefront of a changing IT landscape, creating opportunities from perceived threats. Our focus on innovation and emerging technologies such as flash and converged architectures, our unique position in cloud and software-defined storage and our ability to leverage a strong partner ecosystem enables us to gain share and deliver shareholder value.","Before opening up the call for Q&A, I would like to congratulate the entire NetApp team for again being ranked #3 on the World's Best Multinational Workplaces list by the Great Place to Work Institute. NetApp's unique culture is a differentiator that helps us produce great results for NetApp customers and partners in both good and challenging times.","At this point, I'll open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Shebly Seyrafi is on line with a question.","Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes. So very impressive product gross margin, 57.3%, up 4 points sequentially. How much of that was due to brand versus OEM mix and what's your outlook going forward? Can you maintain around 57%? Or do you think it will go back to, say, 53% or 55% going forward?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Shebly, it's Nick Noviello here. Let me walk you through the pieces to it. I think that the comment on the top, I would say this is -- this, to us, really comes about as overall the competitive position we have, right? That comes through in margins. But let me walk you through some of the pieces to the sequential. So there's about a 4-point difference between Q2 -- I'm sorry, Q1 and Q2 here, and I'll walk you through not only that but what we expect to occur in Q3. So between 1 and 2 points is really due to more richly configured systems in the quarter and volume, okay? So that's 1 to 2 points of the change. We have just over a point from product mix, right? Some of that is due to lower OEM volume than we originally anticipated, and some of product mix goes back the other way in Q3 because Q3 incorporates the calendar year end, which is when we expect generally a little bit heavier OEM business. And then just over a point relates frankly to some timing of supply chain efficiencies, part of which will roll through in normal course through pricing to customers in Q3. So there's a set of things that get you to those 4 points, 1 to 2 on the configuration and volume, just over a point on product mix, just over a point on the supply chain and pricing side of the fence. That's the 4. In terms of a Q3 -- moving from Q2 to Q3, what I would expect is some of that goes back the other way. So first of all, on the product mix side of the fence, because of heavier OEM business, that will go back, right? So maybe about a point there. And then that point that I said on the pricing and supply chain dynamics, that's normal course. That will go back the other way. So I would expect on a Q3 to look more like a 55% on the product gross margin than a 57% on the product gross margin.","Thomas Georgens","If I could add a few things to that, first and foremost, I think we're really pleased with the gross margin. I think as a first indicator of overall competitiveness and strength in the value proposition, I think that's a really important metric for us as a company. So Nick talked about the OEM mix, strong quarter from our standalone software sales, from some of the acquisitions that we did and also company-wide initiative to really drive supply and COGS efficiency. [indiscernible] as this coincides with a very, very steep clustered ONTAP ramp. And I don't think it's purely happenstance that they're both happening at the same time. I think our team, I think our partners and I think our customers are now a lot more confident in understanding the value proposition that's translating through. The one quarter does not make a trend, but nonetheless, a really, really positive development for us. It's something that we feel really good about. So going forward, I think clearly, depending on market dynamics, perceived elasticity and strategic use, some of that we may protect to keep in the P&L and some of that we may use for offensive force to move some new customer acquisition. So overall, I think the clustered ONTAP component and, really, I think a much more firmer understanding and articulation of the value proposition across the entire industry is really a key contributor. So we're really pleased with that number.","Operator","Andrew Nowinski is on line.","Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I'd like to get your thoughts on product revenue growth. Clearly, your branded revenue outperformed the competition this quarter. But as a whole, October of 2012 is really the last quarter where you delivered product revenue growth at or above normal seasonality. In the last 4 consecutive quarters, we've seen it slip well below normal levels. And obviously, I know the OEM component is weighing on that, but that's only 10% of your total revenues. So I guess, are there any underlying trends you can point to that are consistently keeping your product growth depressed, whether it's migration of data to the cloud or any sort of changing competitive dynamics?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think just kind of taking a competitive one on right away, I think if you go back and you look at our product revenue over time and you compare that to the competition, the numbers as well as I do. We see the server vendors down double digits. We see EMC's numbers out there. In fact, if you compare EMC's storage reported revenue against our branded revenue, the NetApp growth is actually bigger than theirs for 5 consecutive quarters now. So I think from a competitive perspective, I think clearly, we've got the upper hand on that battle; and we don't take it for granted but I don't think it's the competitive dynamic at play. I think, clearly, in an aggregate where you got NetApp and EMC as the fastest-growing players, we're both in single digits, and you've got the server vendors with half the market down double digits, clearly, I think it's reflected in the overall growth rate of the business. So I think clearly, industry growth rate is probably the biggest modulator on that number above anything else. If anything, I think the competitive argument actually swings in our favor, just given the relative performance of NetApp compared to the rest of the group.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes. And then, Andrew, the only thing I'd add, and this is Nick, is that you mentioned the OEM side of the fence. But the OEM side was down 28% year-on-year, so it's going to have an impact to the number.","Operator","Amit Daryanani is on line with a question.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the Jan guide, given the softness you just talked about in the October quarter, maybe you can help me understand what gives you the comfort that Jan quarter is going to be much more closer to the seasonal trend of up 5%, call it. I'm wondering if you just have some orders that were delayed and that get pushed out into Jan quarter, if you can give us some share gain opportunity. Maybe just talk about, given the softness in October, why the comfort for seasonal ramp back in Jan?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I don't -- we don't have any units that we didn't ship or anything like that. So there's nothing special about the end of the quarter transition in terms of backlog or anything like that. And I just think, if we look at the outlook, I don't like to call flat as optimistic world view. We're certainly not happy with that at all. But if I think we just look at our pipeline, we look at the business that's out there, we look where we're winning, where we're losing, we certainly understand the federal side of this and the fact that there really was no resolution last time so we went through a shutdown. But still, we still have the end of the continuing resolution within our quarter once again in January. So I think all of those things factor in. But if I look at the business x federal, particularly this quarter that we just passed, it's sort of been a monster quarter had we had another $50 million out of the federal business. So I think, overall, we held up pretty well. While I'm not overly optimistic that there's going to be a rebound in the macro sense, I think that a flat number is hardly anything to be proud of. Maybe in the environment, it is. But I don't think it's an overly aggressive number. It's something that we want to back away from at this point.","Operator","Srini Nandury is on line.","Srini Nandury - Summit Research Partners, LLC","You mentioned briefly that the -- I mean, the mix helped you with the gross margins. And you also mentioned previously in your comments that your FAS6000 has been down slightly and FAS2000 also has been down. Can you comment what's driving the reach [ph] configurations there?","Thomas Georgens","Well, the reach [ph] configuration is really a measure of software specs [ph]. That's really what drives the gross margin. That's what really drives the value that we can convey to our customers. We also have some mix of our software -- standalone software products had a pretty good quarter and clearly, they carry high gross margin. So it isn't so much. I think we talked about this on the call before is the 6000s generally carry a fair amount of software, but they also carry a fair amount of hard drives, which are not high gross margin items for us. And the flip side is this, the lower-end units, the 2000s, are not that heavy on disk drives so they're not carrying a lot of the low gross margin. So therefore, the variability of margin across the product line is actually relatively constant. So therefore, over the years, as we've see the fair amount of volatility, as the market expands and contracts, the relative growth of the different segments, the gross margin has actually been relatively consistent. So I think this is more about software value proposition, independent of the individual hardware component.","Operator","Aaron Rakers is on line.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Kind of building on that, I guess part of that, can you talk about the capacity shipment growth this last quarter? And in that context, how we should think about deals such as one that you've signed with Verizon, how we think about that in terms of longer-term model? If I heard you correctly, I think you said that they were going to host your Data ONTAP on their own machines. So I'm curious of how we should think about that in the context of, be it selling disks or selling hardware over the long term.","Thomas Georgens","Well, capacity growth, just to give a direct answer to the question, was a little over 20% this quarter. And I think that's the highest it's been in a while. But I've also said on prior calls, one of the reasons why we don't report it anymore is that, that's not a primary indicator of our business. So we do things like V-Series. We do things like virtual storage array. So I don't think that our businesses are tied to disk shipments as perhaps some of our competitors are. We're really about proliferating Data ONTAP. I think the more data in the world that's written and formatted by Data ONTAP is an opportunity for us to add software to it and add value and add differentiation as time goes on. So capacity is interesting, but I don't think it's the primary metric of the business. Clearly, we just had a great capacity quarter, but it was still a 1% revenue quarter. Admittedly, 5% branded and strong growth as the competition. But I don't think that capacity correlates with overall NetApp financial health. In fact, we just had capacity up and gross margins up quite a bit as well. So as we think about things like Verizon and AWS and things of that nature, at our core, our differentiation is our software. And that's where we're going to derive our value. And the format in which we deliver that is clearly going to have to evolve as we pursue some of these very, very large opportunities around these aggregators, whether they be traditional service providers or the hyperscalers. So generally and philosophically, I think this has always been true. The proliferation of our software is really the way NetApp is going to continue to do data management in the future and the way we're going to continue to distribute our value. So from our point of view, I think opportunities to go to Verizon with an alternative model that's software-only, that creates a very, very large pool of ONTAP-written data, I think actually expands our opportunity over time. So I think I want to be really clear. We're not a storage systems company per se. We're a data management company, and therefore, it's about software's ubiquity. And that's what we're trying to drive with those products and our product strategy, whether it be Amazon or whether it be Verizon. And you should expect to see more like that as time goes on.","Operator","Ben Reitzes is on line.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to ask a question about APAC and then just overall. In APAC, is there anything more going on there? I asked this question on the Cisco call, but there's been a lot of concerns around the NSA and U.S. brands losing momentum in APAC. And the inability to book and recognize stuff into revenue is not something that seems to be the case, just at NetApp. I was wondering what you're seeing there and when can APAC recover. Depending on your answer to that question, are there other NSA concerns and when can that geo recover? Is there anything bigger going on there?","Thomas Georgens","And if I look at our APAC business in the aggregate this quarter, it had been, historically, our most robust business and had very, very strong growth. And this quarter, we backed off on that. And I think perhaps somewhat counter to some other commentary, where we saw the business strong was China was strong again. ASEAN [ph], basically South Asia was very strong again for us. India actually had a bit of a comeback after being relatively slow for us. Frankly, it's been Japan, after 3 very, very, very strong years, was off. And Australia's been off and I think Australia is a bit more macro-centric. So Japan, I'm not anticipating that, that's going to be a trend. I'm viewing that as timing of orders. But I would -- excuse me, the segments where we'd be most vulnerable to some type of Snowden backlash, those businesses remained robust for us. In fact, we're quite pleased with our China progress. I think last quarter, we reported China up 40%. It wasn't quite that high this quarter but still a very, very good number. So for us, it's actually been some of the more mature markets in Asia that have been more problematic for us, and I'm expecting Japan to bounce back. And I think -- Australia, I think, is a little bit more of a macro concern, and we certainly had some, over the last 6 months, some currency dynamics at play there as well in all those geos.","Operator","Kulbinder Garcha is on line.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question on the branded business, for Tom maybe. I was under the impression that the branded business would see accelerating growth from here onwards. It didn't quite produce so I'm just -- I understand there's a lot of different macro shifts in the world as you went through this quarter. I'm just kind of curious, given the portfolio refresh, is that still something that we could expect going forward? I just think you have an ability to gain share, given the refresh on the portfolio. Then -- and on the OEM revenue, are we at a level now in absolute dollar terms where it should stabilize? Or is it vulnerable still to maybe surprising you on the downside in these coming quarters, do you think?","Thomas Georgens","Well, the one comment I'd have on the branded side is I absolutely agree with you that we have an opportunity to gain share. And in fact, we are gaining share; and in fact, we are outgrowing the market with our branded business. So I think we're seeing all of that. But that's in a backdrop of obviously a weak macro and obviously, federal. I mean, to put federal in context, another $50 million worth of federal business would have made a big difference in our growth and it would have got us substantially to where we guided. And to put this -- just to kind of give you -- we don't' report bookings. But just to kind of give you a sense of the trajectory of our federal business, we entered this fiscal year in May fully cognizant of the sequester. And our federal business was exactly on their annual plan, give or take $100,000 in Q1. In Q2, they were off by $85 million and that's what we saw and that has a big impact on our business. You put that $85 million back in the number, and this would have been a blowout quarter across every metric and we would have been seeing aggressive branded growth. Now on the OEM side, I think there's clearly 2 factors at play there in the OEM business. There's clearly the underlying fundamentals of our partners' business and there's product mix within our partners. And at IBM, clearly both of those are at play. What's a surprise, and probably took us down more than we would have expected this past quarter was that Teradata, who's been a great partner, has had a really, really strong run. They also preannounced a revenue shortfall that we clearly saw. So that was probably the thing that we were not expecting in the OEM business. And that's why the OEM business, we're showing the plan that we put out there. But those 2 components, the federal side and the OEM side, you put those back in the number and you translate that through our gross margin to EPS, it would have been a very, very, very strong EPS quarter.","Operator","Maynard Um is on line.","Maynard Joseph Um - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just have a question about -- in terms of the federal, I understand sort of the pushouts and waiting for the continuing resolution. But I'm just wondering if these are types of deals and I guess projects that are, not so much lost, but at some point will then come back. I guess the real question is, are these just pushouts of the revenue to future quarters, and so the visibility of when it happens isn't that great, but at -- it's not a question, I guess, of when but if it comes back? I'm just curious if that's sort of your viewpoint and we just have to figure out when the revenue starts to come back in. Does that make sense?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think a few things happened, one of which was, as we came upon the end of the government fiscal year, usually there's a lot of money sloshing around at the end and it generates obviously a very, very frothy September. And I think in the context of the sequester, just how much of that money would really be around was a big concern. And I think the sequester certainly had a tempering effect on end-of-the-year spending by the U.S. government. So now we go forward, really nothing's been resolved, right? We just pushed the continuing resolution out until -- out to January and the debt ceiling presumably to February. But it's likely that the sequester spending levels, no matter what happens, will remain intact and this could further be just kicked down the road another 90 days. So I think the federal side, when we talk about bouncing back we're talking about bouncing back most likely to sequester-spending levels. But in the meantime, there's a fair amount of uncertainty. And probably my broader concern, frankly, is that companies like us that have a dependency upon that business and we see it slow down and perhaps for a protracted period of time, that has impact on our spending. And if other companies are acting like we are, then clearly, the impact of the government is going to spill over to the commercial side of the house, and then we'll see that going forward as well. And that is also reflected in our guidance to some degree. So I'm not expecting it to be as simple as one day, a bill is going to be signed and suddenly there's going to be a flush of federal revenue. I think last year is over, and I don't think that, that's going to necessarily flow into this year. I think this year will be built around the current spending levels that will include the sequester. So if this is big, avalanche of business are suddenly going to come our way to make up for what didn't get bought at the end of last year. I just don't believe that's the case.","Operator","Ananda Baruah is on line.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Tom and Nick, just -- was wanting to get your thoughts on, I guess, buyback as we look through the year. And I guess you're guiding the share count to be flat Jan quarter versus October quarter. What's sort of your expectations regards to share count reductions as you look through the year? I know you're saying that you're expecting to go through the $1 billion by May. I guess from the share count perspective, how should we expect that to manifest in the model?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes. Ananda, it's Nick. Let me just walk you through the pieces. So when we give guidance for the third quarter at 350 million shares, what we've included in there is what we've purchased so far in the quarter, which is 7 million shares and really, it's sort of where we're at today. And the reason for doing that is because in a situation where we can do a combination of open-market purchases, accelerated purchases, timing on all those purchases, the amount and ultimate impact on diluted share count for the quarter can, frankly, move around pretty significantly. So at the end of the day, we'll be consistent with what we've done in the past, which I say, expect us to do $1 billion between now and May. As we enter a quarter, we'll give you our best view given on the first -- given the first 10 days of where we're at. As we exit a quarter, you'll obviously in the -- see in the cash flow statement what we actually spent, and we'll talk about it and do the same thing going forward. So we'll maintain a consistent approach here. I think the overall theme that you should keep in mind as we will do the additional $1 billion, we're on plan to do that. We will be opportunistic in that, but we will consider anything from open-market purchases to accelerated plans.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. So Nick, I guess just to clarify that, it sounds like you're saying, as of right now, this is your guidance. But the impact could be different as we move through the quarter, depending.","Nicholas R. Noviello","That's correct, because that 350 million is based upon the first 10 days of activity. So just like the 350 million can change as a result of exercises, as a result of share price, as a result of some other things, it can also move as a result of repurchases that we do in the quarter. The ultimate timing of those repurchases will also impact how much shows up in the weighted average. So there's a lot of moving parts. So the definitive stuff we can give you is what's already behind us, which is the first 10 days.","Operator","Scott Craig is on line.","Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You guys have done a really good job on the cash cycle, and it's 2 quarters in a row, where it's been at a pretty low level, I guess, relative to historical. So can you walk us through any pushes and pulls you see on that going forward? Is this some -- is this sort of a new level, where we're setting the bar at now?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes. Maybe you can clarify for me in terms of cash cycle. Are you talking about how we're doing on the DSOs and on the inventory side of the fence? Or are you saying something else?","Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, it would be the total of the 3 components of it, just adding to a really good number over the last couple of quarters.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes. I think there is some seasonality that will always happen on the receivable side of the fence. But what we've seen here is, on top of the seasonality, some real operational improvement that's happened quarter after quarter and when we look year-over-year that we can see that improvement. So that is real. On the inventory side, we had built up -- frankly, we had built up as a result of the Engenio acquisition and had to move through all the integration activity there. We had inventory as a result of the Thailand drive crisis. We've had inventory as we go through manufacturing our transitions. We do all of that, and we manage all of those things but, again, I think very strong performance. Our expectation was that inventory turns were going to come up this year, and they are doing that. So I think across the board on the operational stuff, we are -- we're doing quite well.","Thomas Georgens","Yes, we did. I think that's 3 quarters now of inventory turns over 19. So those are good numbers, particularly there in the OEM business, which has a lot of inventory that we hold on behalf of our partners. So I think integrating that business into NetApp and still pushing inventory turns near historical highs, I'm really pleased with the work the team has done. And overall, you see the cash flow number. And that's pretty significant cash flow in a quarter where NetApp was roughly flat in overall revenue. So clearly, I think the execution side of the house was very, very strong this quarter, and it proves that NetApp is a very, very strong cash generator even in a tough environment.","Operator","Bill Shope is on line.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Looking at the answers to some of the prior questions, particularly around gross margin, it sounds like you guys do think you can continue to ship more richly configured systems. And outside of the software demand that you're seeing from the cloud-centric customers, and if we look at your traditional enterprise customer base, can you give some color on what specific add-ons you're seeing the greatest incremental demand for? And are there specific workloads that you think are driving this over time?","Thomas Georgens","Yes, that's a good question. I think -- if I think about clustered ONTAP overall, we talked about the use cases of clustered ONTAP, some of which are clear and some of which, I think, are new to NetApp. So the traditional use case of NetApp is enterprise file services. We've already got some of the biggest installations in the world, and clustered ONTAP allows us to supply that at scale. I don't think that's new to anybody. Likewise, virtualization is a big bet for us, and clustered ONTAP allows us to build much more significant infrastructures that allow customers to virtualize even more mission-critical applications. But I think the other part of it for NetApp is to be able to take this technology into a set of workloads where we previously had not been servicing by virtue of the [indiscernible] scale, the performance of the nondisruptive capability of clustered ONTAP; and a lot of those are software-intensive. So I think it's a combination of the customers understanding the value proposition, how to present it, how to price it. But I also think it's opening up new workloads to us, and I think that's a big part of our new customer acquisition. An interesting component of the FlexPod business, by the way, is roughly half the FlexPod business, I think a little at 45% or so of the FlexPod, are actually sold with clustered ONTAP. A lot of that was going into new deployments. A lot of that was going to new customers, driven by our joint channel partners between us and Cisco and some of our other partners. And by the way, I believe I misspoke on the prepared statements. We have 900 channel partners selling FlexPod, not 90. But overall, I think that -- I think, really, the story at the end of the day here isn't so much the software attach rate. It's really the aggregate business value of the product compared to the applications that we're deploying. And I think the better we understand and can articulate, the better the customers understand the value, the better we're able to defend the price, and therefore, command the gross margin that's appropriate to the technology we provide.","Operator","We have Lou Miscioscia on line.","Louis R. Miscioscia - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Tom, I want to drill on a little bit more about flash in the sense that it sounds like you're doing well. But just curious, how much are you actually selling into the installed base? And when you look at all the start-ups, I mean, collectively, whether they're hybrid array vendors or all-flash array vendors, they seem to be having a material amount of revenue. Obviously, if they didn't exist, that would be growth most likely going to you. So is one issue that for FAS and ONTAP, if the legacy code really just doesn't work as well with hybrids or all flash, I mean, actually, your FlashRay isn't out yet. And then secondly, as for the FAS side, have you actually moved to NOC or you're still using a more expensive SOC?","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I think on the flash question, I think the success and the raw performance of the EF540 should lay to rest the canard that there's something magical about flash drives that work around prior disk technology somehow is irrelevant. Frankly, the EF540 team has been doing this thing for a long time, and it's something to be said for code stream optimization. And the fact that they can outperform all the other supposedly flash-optimized products pretty much puts to rest that argument. I think that the real component here, though, is that ONTAP is really built around a very, very broad feature set around data management, things like that, which are not suited to necessarily an all-flash array. I mean, at the end of the day, the all-flash array is about delivering performance ay low latency to applications and that's really the optimized design point for the EF540, and that's why it's been so successful. The other thing that the EF540 brings with it that the startups don't have is, if you look at the primary EF540 use case that we see right now, it's been database acceleration, which is usually in front of some other basically mainframe or monolithic storage products; and those are pretty significant and demanding environment. So the fact the EF540 can bring very high performance and very mature HA to that environment is a key differentiator. And that pretty much knocks out a lot of the startup companies and the immature products from the other mature vendors out of that category. So if you look at what's moving the EF540, it's basically extreme strong performance, not from some brand-new data layout, but from basically 20 years of experience in optimizing code lines and the ability to overlay that with high availability to go aggressively after these use cases. And like I said, database acceleration is a classic one. Another use case that we're seeing out there is basically taking monolithic arrays that have got short-stroke hard drives that are basically trying to drive performance out of the hard drive or replacing them outright. So we've actually had a couple of installations where we actually used EF540s to replace traditional frame arrays. So we pretty excited about that particular segment. And overall, for all this talk about this market, NetApp from effectively s standing start in February, shipped almost 550 systems. And that's got to put us in the top 2 or 3 position overall in the all-flash market. If we stay on this trajectory, obviously, we can go up from there.","Louis R. Miscioscia - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And how about the ONTAP side, because there's got to be use cases there too, how do you resolve that?","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I think that there's a pure hybrid use case, which I think is a much, much bigger market opportunity than all-flash array. So I think the idea of basically using flash to accelerate very, very large pools of back-end storage and then use all the other features of ONTAP, the replication, the data protection, the application integration, the storage efficiency and all of those things, to basically marry those 2 technologies. So by no means do I see all-flash array as a substitute for flash-integrated like the Flash Cache and the Flash Pool within ONTAP. I just think that they serve different use cases, particularly around the performance case. And in the end, I think the winning story here is basically the integration of those 2. Because I believe that in the end, all flash deployments are hybrid in nature at the macro level. So I think that the integration of flash with ONTAP is really going to be long-term differentiator here as opposed to standalone point product providers.","Operator","Stephen Fox [ph] is on line.","Unknown Analyst","Just to follow up on that last question. So just specifically from a marketing standpoint, it sounds like some of the newer competitors aren't sort of taking share from you. It sounds like you're in a position to take share. Can you just sort of talk about how you would say near term before some of that evolution takes place, you would position yourself from a flash standpoint within the market? And then secondly, I don't know if you want to pass on this question or not. But there's been a couple of lawsuits filed by you and EMC regarding some companies planning on coming public or may come public. I don't know, I'm just curious what that says about the competitive environment for some of the startups.","Thomas Georgens","Well, a few things. One of them is, as far as the startup community, frankly, only a handful of them are generating revenue. But it's still revenue, right? And in a low-growth market, it all matters. So it's not something that we take lightly and we -- or something that we're ignoring. But in the end, the long-term innovators and the long-term market share players in this space are going to be NetApp and EMC, and we certainly see EMC a lot more than we see anybody else. In terms of the generic category of legal activity, clearly, we're going to protect our intellectual property and we're going to protect our confidential information. We're going to take the appropriate steps to do that. We've taken a few actions, not all of them against small companies. And the one you referred to, Nimble, has been the latest one. But there's nothing special about that one and frankly, the other 2 that preceded it have achieved a favorable outcome for NetApp. So these are not frivolous activities. These are basically us protecting legitimate interest and have a legitimate grievance, and we'll do more of them if necessary. But I would say it's not in a response to any specific competitive IPO dynamic or anything like that, because we've done them to big companies to small companies, pre-IPO and post-IPO.","Unknown Analyst","Great, that's very helpful. And then just one quick clarification. I think I understood this correctly, but there's been no change in your roadmap on the all-flash array if we look out over the next several quarters. Is that correct?","Thomas Georgens","No, no. But I think you'll -- I think flash array data this year and availability next year, and EF540 and EF550 will be -- you'll see an upgrade to that soon.","Operator","Brian Alexander is on line.","Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Nick, you mentioned at the beginning that the margin guidance is unchanged for fiscal '14. If I back into what that implies for your fourth quarter based on the first half results and the guidance for Q3, it would suggest that gross margins will be down materially in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, and operating margins will be basically flat sequentially. So can you just talk a little bit more about the margin dynamics beyond the third quarter? You did a great job laying out the puts and takes for Q2 and Q3. And am I reading your annual targets too literally? Or do you think you can actually exceed those, based on the results and progress you've made this year?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Well, I haven't done anything other than say what the annual targets were at the beginning of the year and reiterate the fact that, that's what we believe we will be able to deliver. At the end of the day, those are always going to be subject to revenue and mix and all of those other pieces. I think what you should be thinking about as well is we started the year with an operating margin of sub-15%, right? We did quite well in the second quarter. You can see what we're guiding to in the third quarter here. But the year is a -- it's going to keep moving, so there's also moving parts there. There's investments that we may or may not decide to make. There are sets of dynamics in the business that we may or may not decide to do. So what I want you to take away is, overall, that guidance we are firm on. We are also firm on being able to generate earnings per share growth from operations alone in the mid-teens, which is not changed. So despite the fact that there's pressure out there on the revenue side of the fence, certainly in Q2, we've got some obviously -- certainly versus where the street is, guided conservatively for Q3 based upon the macro condition, we feel very good about the results that we can generate inside of that.","Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great and just a quick follow-up, Tom. On the service provider relationships that you've been announcing, just to be clear, you view these partnerships as incremental gross profit dollar growth opportunities as opposed to cannibalizing existing sales either to service providers or to enterprises that are moving to the cloud. You view this as basically TAM expansion, if you will.","Thomas Georgens","Well, I mean, clearly, it ultimately depends on how this all plays out. But I guess, from a philosophical point of view is, if you look at -- and if you look at our business overall and you look at our aggregate market share in the teens, one of the challenges that we have and, frankly, everybody has in the company, everybody wishes they had more coverage and everybody wishes they were able to reach more customers. So if entities are going to emerge that are going to consolidate substantial amounts of customer demand in one place and we can participate in that, then I think that, compared to our 16% enterprise share, there's an opportunity to participate in a much bigger percentage of the business, whether that's consolidated Amazon, whether it's consolidated Verizon or Orange or other players as we go down this list. So what we see them as a consolidator of demand and therefore, a very, very interesting target for us. And if we can be successful there and get them to standardize on ONTAP-based technology, then there's enormous opportunity for us to continue to add value, continue to bring software to bear on those problems and also to integrate on-premise and off-prem computing. I mean, if we have a very, very strong premise at the cloud providers, both traditional service providers and hyperscalers, what customers really want is a seamless data management interface between on-prem and off-prem that actually might generate demand in on-premise computing in the traditional market. So I think it's going to be an integral part of how people see the market going forward. And the more market share we can gain in the service provider community and the easier we can make that technology to integrate with people's IT infrastructure, I think the stronger we become overall as an enterprise data management player. So from that perspective, TAM expansion, on an incremental basis, I think it's a more strategic conversation than that. It's -- I think it's about the ubiquity of ONTAP. And if the ONTAP is ubiquitous, I think that's a good thing for NetApp.","Operator","And our last question comes from Steve Milunovich.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Nick, I believe the company is planning on about $30 million of savings this quarter based on prior headcount reductions and savings. Is that the number that came through? And was that all reinvested? Or did some of that drop to the bottom line? And how do you see that playing out over the next quarter?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes, so that was pretty close to just under that was what we delivered in gross from those activities we did at the beginning of the first quarter around realignment. That is also reinvested, right? So all of those things take place and that is up all built into the operating expense line that we delivered for the quarter. So we did generate the savings, not quite $30 million, just below that. And we did reinvest in a number of areas across the company with those savings.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And you plan to pretty much reinvest 100% again next quarter?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Well, what we had indicated as we opened up the year is that our plan is to reinvestment but we will use that as a lever, right? Because to the degree market conditions change, right, we are also looking to deliver on an overall plan for the company, both inside and outside. So we preserve that lever. Some of the reinvestments are things that play out over longer periods of time. Some of the have onetime, shorter-term impact. We run and really drive all of those levers here as we run the company.","Thomas Georgens","If I could just follow on to that a little bit and wrap up, I think -- to Nick's point, I think the execution intensity of the company was very, very high this quarter. We talked earlier about gross margins. We talked about DSO. We talked about inventory turns. The realignment that Nick just talked about, we navigated that without disrupting the business. We moved a factory in our first quarter with 0 disruption overall. And the other thing about this quarter is the shutdown was complicated on a number of fronts. Not only were purchasing people deemed not essential, we had a lot of clients that weren't accepting deliveries. So we actually had complexity around shipping product that we already had orders for. And the other dynamic, a little subtle, is that our quarter ended on the 25th, so there wasn't a lot of time between the shutdown release and the end of the quarter. And I think the team's response to that was very, very, very strong. And I don't think we left much behind.","So overall, if I look at this quarter, and just kind of a closing statement is that clearly it's a challenging environment. The fed makes it only more challenging. But I think within that, I think NetApp's competitive posture is demonstrated in the gross margin. It's demonstrated in the branded product growth. And if I look at our portfolio, clustered ONTAP is still in its early days. EF is still in its early days. FlashRay on the way. E-Series is a new technology that was just really starting to get some traction in the channel. If I look at our portfolio, I see a lot of technology in the early days of its monetization. So I can't say with confidence that the macro is going to rebound and rebound strong and when that's going to happen. But I can say that no matter what happens in the macro, NetApp is strong and we intend to continue to gain share regardless of the world around us. And that's going to be our focus.","So thanks for your time. Thanks for your interest in NetApp, and see you all in 90 days.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call maybe recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Kris Newton, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin.","Kris Newton","Hello, and thank you for joining us on our Q2 fiscal year 2017 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and a non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the third quarter, our expectations regarding future revenue growth and improved profitability including cash flow and shareholder returns, all of which involve risk and uncertainty.","We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including the macroeconomic and IT spending environment, our ability to successfully pivot to the growth areas of the market, to gain market share, to expand our operating margin, to reduce our cost structure, and to continue our capital allocation strategy.","Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q, our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2016 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can also be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George.","George Kurian","Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our focus on the disciplined execution again yielded solid results on the top and bottom-lines. Our second quarter fiscal year 2017 revenue was as the midpoint of our prior guidance range with both operating margin and earnings per share above our previous guidance. And we expanded our innovation in our industry leading flash and hybrid cloud solutions during the quarter. These results are clear evidence of our ability to execute, while we streamline the business and pivot to the growth areas of the market. ","As you've heard from us before we have three priorities to deliver on our commitment to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. First, we are executing our data fabrics strategy and delivering this strategic solutions that create the foundation for how we enabled customer success. Second, we are permanently lowering our cost structure and streamlining operations while maintaining our ability to innovate. And third, we are continuing our robust capital allocation program, which includes a mix of share buy backs, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business.","I'll begin with an update on our first priority. Our strategic solutions are aligned to our customer's top IT imperatives and position us to lead in the new era of IT. In Q2, strategic solutions comprised 62% of net product revenue, growth was relatively flat against a tough compare in Q2 fiscal year 2016, but grew 10% sequentially, an indication that we continue to gain attraction in customer environments.","Net product revenue from our mature solutions declined at 29% year-over-year. We expect that over the course of this fiscal year, the headwinds from mature solutions will lessen allowing the growth of the strategic solutions to return the company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. As you saw in the Q3 guidance included in our press release we expect this shift to begin delivering growth in the second half of this fiscal year. Much like us, our customers need to drive efficiency in the mature parts of their businesses while adding flexibility to capture new business opportunities, out execute the competition and grow revenue. ","To achieve this we are transforming IT. Modernizing their datacenters so that they can lower costs, increase agility, get more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with on premises environments. As customers modernize their infrastructures they are replacing standalone silos of storage and monolithic frame arrays which scale out software defined shared storage platforms. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk and public and private cloud environments.","With Clustered ONTAP, IT organizations can consolidate multiple workloads into a single repository dramatically improving the efficiency of their enterprise storage infrastructure. We continue to see strong customer demand and are gaining new customers and migrating existing customers to Clustered ONTAP. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 86% of FAS system shipped in Q2, up from roughly 70% a year ago. Unit shipments of Clustered ONTAP systems grew 14% year-over-year. The installed base of FAS systems continues to grow and Clustered ONTAP is now running on approximately 36% of systems in that large and growing installed base.","At the beginning of the fiscal year, we introduced ONTAP 9 which unifies data management across flash, disk and cloud bridging current enterprise workloads and new emerging applications. The initial customer feedback has been tremendously positive. In the first four months since its release, ONTAP 9 has had the highest adoption rate of any of our major ONTAP introductions. In Q2, we expanded the innovation of ONTAP 9 with built-in multichannel capable inscription for improve data security, support for massively scalable high performance NAS containers and greatly simplified provision in operations for enterprise applications.","To gain advantage through greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications while substantially lowering total cost of ownership, customers are leveraging flash technology as part of their IT transformations. Flash is being used for a wide range of workloads and becoming the main stream choice for on premises deployments, requiring that all flash arrays deliver enterprise grade data management capabilities.","NetApp is leading the industry in the transition to flash with our highly differentiated portfolio of all flash arrays which provide customers with unrivaled scales, speed and data services. Gartner recognized NetApp as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Solid-State arrays. IDC ranks NetApp number two in the all flash array market with our growth outpacing depth of the market and our peers. We expect to gain share again this quarter.","In the second quarter, our all flash array business tripled year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of over $1 billion inclusive of all flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services. With flash moving from a point solution to a per basis technology, we refreshed our portfolio of ONTAP powered hybrid in all flash arrays in Q2. We also enhanced ONTAP Select to support flash in commodity servers. Our new hybrid array systems expand the requirements of large enterprise data centers to small enterprises and mid-size businesses offer dramatically increased speed and responsiveness compare to our previous hybrid arrays and scale up to 14 petabytes in a single system and out to a 172 petabytes in a Cluster.","Our new all flash systems offer the industries best data management features with up to twice the performance of prior system at half the latency and are designed for easy setup in less than 10 minutes. Our new all flash FAS systems are included in our flash promotion which offers 3X guaranteed performance and a 4:1 guaranteed increase in storage efficiency over competitive disk arrays as well as a risk free upfront trial, free storage controller upgrade and support extension to simplify ongoing operations. The majority of our growth in the All-Flash-Array market is driven by the All-Flash FAS customers are deploying the All-Flash FAS to improve existing infrastructure and processes, lower cost and enhanced flexibility. ","A North American Financial Services Company choose the All-Flash FAS to create a modern alternative to their expensive legacy monolithic private channel SAN array from a competitor. Another North American Financial Services Company replaced the competitor's NAS footprint with an All-Flash FAS cluster connected to a disk-based cluster with SnapVault backup services to create a tiered cloud service model for its next generation file services platform. We\u2019re gaining new customers and new footprint at existing customers with our All-Flash-Array's.","For the first half of calendar 2016 NetApp is the fastest growing SAN vendor as measured by IDC. A clear indicator that we are moving outside of our traditional installed base and expanding our market opportunity. ","For enterprises and service providers who want to build a multichannel public and private clouds SolidFire delivers a web scale style architecture for next generation datacenters. Through the expanded reach of NetApp we are acquiring new customers introducing SolidFire into existing NetApp accounts and bringing NetApp solutions to SolidFire customers.","A global financial services company is moving to NetApp after years of preference for a competitor. They are building a next generation datacenter environment to power their digitization of their services by deploying ONTAP as the storage infrastructure for their open-stack environment, SolidFire for their IT web dev environment and storage grid web scale for their third platform solutions and archiving.","Each of these products address unique requirements in the customers environment while delivering the performance and reliability needed for a global digital enterprise. SolidFire is a key area of focused in investments for the long-term growth of NetApp and is performing to plan.","Customers are also leveraging the hybrid cloud in their IT transformations to capitalize on the value of their data. Our data fabrics strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate systems, software stacks, clouds and datacenters allowing customers to architect the IT environment that best meets their needs utilizing a mix of flash, disk and public and private cloud resources. All at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world.","Customers can innovate faster by leveraging the scale of on demand cloud capabilities, while maintaining data visibility with the single consistent view of data and infrastructure of chorus clouds and on premises resources.","Earlier this month, we announce new data fabric solutions and services that maximize control and improve the secure movement of data across the hybrid cloud, along with updated versions of AltaVault, storage grid web scale and SnapCenter technologies to help customers extract the value of their data from anywhere in the hybrid cloud. We expanded the used case for ONTAP cloud to include Microsoft Azure and announce cloud control for Microsoft Office 365, a simple way to control and protect critical data stored in Office 365 which support for data retention in cloud services such as Amazon, S3 and Azure as well as on premises storage.","Additionally, we introduced NetApp private storage as a service, an OpEx based consumption model available to a growing partner delivery ecosystem. We are engaging with the broadest set of partners to help customers plan and evolve their hybrid cloud deployments to fit their changing business needs, and more and more customers and cloud service providers are choosing NetApp because we enabled their hybrid cloud strategies.","While Ron will go into depth about cost savings and capital allocations, I want to reemphasis our commitment to both priorities. At the start of the third quarter we announced a reduction in force as part of our planned transformation and cost reduction efforts. This action was taken in alignment with real structural changes to make our business more streamlined and agile. We are making substantial progress against $130 million cost reduction goal net of reinvestment that the outlined on our Q3 fiscal year 2016 earnings call. We are on target and expect to achieve the remainder of savings through the normal course of business.","I want to thank the NetApp team for remaining focused on execution while making difficult restructuring decisions. We are pleased with our progress but still have more work ahead of us. We are advancing our product and solutions portfolio, evolving our ecosystem of partners, streamlining our business processes and enhancing our go-to-market model. We sharpened our focus, accelerated our innovation and are funding the investments against the fastest growing parts of the market like all flash arrays, next generation data centers and hybrid clouds solutions, while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow.","We are on track to return the company to long term growth and to our target operating margin range, but we must remain focused and continue our disciplined execution. Our second quarter results and third quarter guidance are evidence that our strategy is working and I am more confident than ever in the NetApp team's ability to successfully evolve the company for leadership in the data power digital era.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q2 financial performance and expectations for Q3. Ron?","Ron Pasek","Thanks George and good afternoon everyone. As a remainder, we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. As you heard from George, we continue to make significant progress toward growth areas of the market while at the same time transforming the company. Q2 marks another quarter of solid execution albeit against a difficult year-over-year compare.","Net revenues were at the midpoint of our guidance at $1.34 billion, this was an increase of approximately 3.5% sequentially and a decline of about 7% on a year-over-year basis. Product revenue of $710 million increased 7.5% sequentially and decline 13% year-over-year. As we have discussed, we expect the growth of strategic solutions to improve our product revenue growth trajectory over the course of fiscal 2017.","The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue of $630 million, was relatively flat sequentially and year-over-year.","Gross margin was 62.7% and within our guidance range. Product gross margin of 48.2% decreased about 3.5 points year-over-year and increase 1.5 points sequentially. Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat sequentially and year-over-year while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased just over 3 points year-over-year. ","Operating expenses of $636 million decreased 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing transformation efforts. Operating margin of 15.2% was above our guidance range evidenced of the progress we\u2019re making towards the operating margin range that we guided for the year. Aligning our cost structure with the opportunities ahead remains my top priority. As I said on our last earnings call part of the plan transformation efforts would include additional steps to permanently lower our cost structure including headcount reductions. ","As such on November 3rd we initiated a reduction of approximately 6% of our worldwide headcount which will results in a onetime charge of $50 million to $60 million, primarily in Q3 fiscal 2017. This action will yield an annual run rate savings of approximately $130 million. As a reminder we are driving to permanently reduce our cost structure across both cost of sales and OpEx. In Q3 \u201916, we announced our plans to reduce our cost structure by $400 million annualized by the end of fiscal 2017. We said some of those savings will be reinvested into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and will yield a net run rate savings annually of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017.","We have made meaningful progress against this plan by implementing tighter cost controls over indirect spending, improving supply chain efficiency, streamlining our product portfolio, evolving business processes and reducing headcount. Given the progress we\u2019ve made today, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal on schedule.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 284 million. EPS of $0.60 was $0.04 over the high-end of our guidance range, reflecting improved gross margin, lower operating expense, and the benefit of our share repurchases. Our cash and balance sheet metrics remain healthy. We closed Q2 with $4.4 billion in cash in short-term investments with approximately 10% held by our domestic entities. We remain committed to completing by the end of May 2018, the remaining balance of our share repurchase program announced in February 2015.","In Q2, we repurchased $117 million of our stock, and paid approximately $52 million in cash dividends. Today we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which will be paid on January 25, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 6, 2017.","Deferred and finance unearned services revenue was up 5% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Q2 cash flow from operations was $158 million up 9% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $102 million, an increase of about 3% year-over-year. We are aggressively managing our working capital metrics DSO, DPO and days of the inventory outstanding.","DSO were flat year-over-year while DPO increased by eight days and days of inventory outstanding improved by three days. As a result our cash conversion cycle was nine days which was an improvement of 12 days year-over-year, but three days longer sequentially due to the seasonal increase in DSO.","Now, onto guidance, as outlined today, our transformation efforts are resulting in stronger more focused and agile company. We were committed to driving productivity, while at the same time continuing to shift our investment and focus towards the growth areas of the market. We're increasingly encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing. While we still have work to do we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute against the plans we outlined for fiscal 2017 on our Q1 earnings call.","For Q3 we expect net revenues to range between $1.325 billion to $1.475 billion which at the midpoint implies a sequential increase of approximately 4% and a 1% increase year-over-year. We expect Q3 gross margin in the range of 61.5% to 62.5% and operating margin between 18% and 18.5%. And finally we expect earnings per share for the third quarter to range from approximately $0.72 to $0.77 per share.","With that I'll hand it back to Kris to open to open the call for Q&A. Kris?","Kris Newton","We'll now open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","George you mentioned the workforce realignment or change, I believe, like in early November of this year. Can you just clarify -- earlier this month, can you just clarify was that incremental to prior rounds of restructuring and if so, are we at the point where you have now made all your announcements and done all your realignments or is this kind of like phase two or three and still more to come because your OpEx as really been quite impressive, you\u2019re just this kind of measure where you\u2019re at along that phase of thought there?","George Kurian","We announced a program to reduce the cost structure of the company permanently as part of our Q3 fiscal year '16 earnings call; and we're making substantial progress against that. We took an action as you can recall in Q4 of fiscal '16 to accelerate the pace of transformation and we've taken a second action in November in alignment with the prior transformation efforts.","We took these actions in two steps, to allow the business to make the structural changes necessary so that we can sustain the cost savings going forward. At this point we have accomplished a substantial portion of the cost savings activity and we think we can accomplish the remainder of the savings through the ongoing course of our business operations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian White with Drexel. Your line is now open.","Brian White","I'm wondering if you can talk about a little bit about how the Del EMC combination has offered opportunities thus far kind of what are you seeing out in the field right now. Thank you.","George Kurian","Del and EMC continue to be a formidable competitor and we compete with them in the broadest range as both customer and the reseller opportunities as I communicated on the call we are taking core customers from EMC, but because of the strength of our technology both in solid-state as well as next generation datacenters and increasingly because of the relationships that we have with the hyper scale cloud providers.","We continue to compete, they continue to compete aggressively, there are a formidable competitors and we need stay focus but we do feel that in this transaction of this combination we do see opportunities both in terms of the recruiting new channel partners as well as willing customer footprints that are net new to NetApp.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is now open. ","Unidentified Analyst ","This is Victor in for Simon. I wanted to drill in on your All-Flash products just a little bit. Some of the discussions that we've had with our checking distributors suggested that the success of some of your competitors early on with All-Flash was more attributed to timing and the positive reception that you\u2019re seeing to NetApp solutions more recently implies that those customers may have preferred NetApp's offering all along if it have been available at that time. So can you just comment to the degree that it\u2019s consistent with? What you are seeing and kind of what that means the headroom in terms of improvements in the share gains?","George Kurian","First of all the market as we've said before has transitioned from an early adopter market to a mainstream replacement of performance drives with solid state arrays. In that transition customers are looking for consistency in their business processes, risk management, as well as the maturity of the technology solutions and our solid-state portfolio we feel is the best positioned in the market without question. Because we combine state of art technology efficiency and scale out architectures with the world's best data management features for enterprise datacenters with all flash FAS and for web scale datacenters with SolidFire. We have gained share in solid-state and we continue to feel confident about our prospects going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Nolan with Robert. W Baird. Your line is now open.","Jason Nolan ","I wanted to ask George on MD&A and cross point and how important are these new technologies what's the timing look like and how are you positioned data phase so strong reasonably I'm wondering what this holds for us in \u201917 and in \u201918?","George Kurian","I think there are lots of elevations to come in the solid-state storage market the two that you referenced are certainly things that we have in our technology portfolio and we will as I said make those offerings available with when they are mature and ready for mainstream customers just like we have done with All-Flash storage solutions. There is a long roadmap of success ahead on 3D NAND technology, then there is evolutions to that. And what I\u2019ll tell you is that even with with 3D XPoint and NDME, the same values that we have brought to some enterprise all flash array market will continue to have value for customers. Proven software, mature enterprise systems technology and the track record and experience of large successful storage and data Management Company.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich from USB. Your line is now open.","John Long","It's John Long in for Steve. Wanted to get the question, are you kind of saying that the competitive environment has allowed product gross margins to essentially reach a bottom here at around 48%, is that we kind of think going forward?","George Kurian","It's difficult to tell, the environment changes constantly. I would like to think it's bottom, that would be good. We are doing some work to improve product gross margin, it will take some time for that to pay off. But at this point I think, I would like to think it is the bottom.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","Irvin Liu","Thanks guys, this is Irvin Liu calling in for Amit, first of all congrats on a great quarter. And I just want to ask you about your mature product revenues, they declined by about 29% year-over-year, and I was wondering if there is a sort of maintain level run rate for the mature business going forward and if so how close are we to reaching those levels?","George Kurian","So just to set context, the mature bucket includes the OEM business both E and N-series, the ONTAP 7 mode business and the add-on storage components of the mature buckets, we see that the predominant declines are behind us and we\u2019re reaching a point where the forward looking declines should be less material than they have been in the past. As you can see even this past quarter, the rate of decline sequentially continues to moderate relative to what we saw in '16.","Add-on storage which is a large percentage of the mature bucket is not going to decline at anything like the rates of 7 mode or OEM and so we feel that going forward we should see some degree of stability in the mature business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mark Moskowitz","I wanted to see if we could better understand the trend line through the underlying business. Strategic revenue growth fell to 1% versus 24% in July and 16%, and then storage system revenue declined nearly 13% after almost flat in last quarter. I guess I'm concerned we're seeing some major decelerations by developing good strides you made in both revenue and also OpEx by containment.","George Kurian","Yes, so Mark, I think part of the challenger last year was Q2 was our single highest quarter. So it's really difficult compare. So you saw -- last quarter we actually had product revenue roughly flat and we guided for Q2, we knew that it would be a difficult compare, we knew it was going to be down double digits. If you include the guidance we gave going forward that starts to get better as we move forward to Q3 and Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Rod Hall","Just came off the Cisco call and commentary there has written -- relates to a little bit of underlying weakness in enterprise, obviously the forward looking, more service provider. But a lot of the numbers suggest weak enterprise spending particularly in the midsize business environment, so I wonder if you guys could comment on what you're seeing from that point of view? And then I guess I also would ask you to comment a little bit on the cash return policy.","Obviously we're looking at potentially lower tax rates now and some changes with the administration coming up with Trump presidency, so could you just talk a little bit about how that might affect your thinking with regards to cash return?","George Kurian","Okay, let me take the economic environment, as we've said on the call, it remains uncertain macroeconomic environment, I think spending decisions are not materially different than they were in the prior quarter, but you have to compete every opportunity and we've done that through the course of this quarter and we intend to do that successfully through the course of next quarter. I would say that the geographic mix of our business reflects the economic environment across the globe. It's a diverse landscape and we have strengthened some parts of the work where the economic environment is stronger and our executions has been better and it's been mixed in other parts of the world. I'll let Ron talk a little bit about our cash return policy.","Ron Pasek","There's couple of things being discussed. We would prefer fundamental corporate tax reform as opposed to one-time holiday. We'll wait and see what that looks like and decide what the best return policy is based on that. And I think doing a holiday is beneficial and it might be advantage to take -- for us to take advantage of that, but to fix the permanent disadvantages U.S. companies have in the world will require a fundamental corporate tax reform.","George Kurian","[Multiple Speakers] It's a little early for us to comment. We're going to wait to see what the new administration defines to be its policies both on trade and tax and then we'll communicate our plans soon thereafter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Aaron Rakers","I wanted to talk a little bit differently about the competitive landscape. I know Cisco was mentioned in a prior question. Cisco's obviously got a strategy of trying to push their HyperFlex product. We now see Nutanix out in the market as a public entity. I'm curious to how you guys are currently seeing the hyperconverged market, where you see that competitively showing up and, if not, why that wouldn't be.","George Kurian","First of all, our relationship with Cisco has been strong, the All-Flash FAS has driven a really strong business together with FlexPod and is allowing us to compete in parts of the data center with FlexPod that we couldn't before. The second is as we said hyper conversions has a value to customers who require rapid time to provisioning or a very simplified configuration for departmental and small office workloads.","We have two approaches to compete with hyper converged solutions, one is a set of innovations that we brought to the FlexPod family called FlexPod Automation and the second is with SolidFire which provides a zero touch storage provisioning solutions. The release of SolidFire that we introduced in the summer of this year called Fluorine allows us to compete very well with Hyper converge solutions and VMware environments and we have been seeing wins. So we realize there is value to customers from Hyper converged offerings and we have solutions to respond to those customer needs. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Louis Miscioscia with CLSA. Your line is now open.","Louis Miscioscia ","Can you maybe help us out with the guidance both on the high-end and the low-end? In essence the high-end if we were actually able to do it, if I\u2019m doing my math right would suggest a quarter-to-quarter product revenue number given that software entitlement services have pretty steady numbers of a 127 million quarter-to-quarter and absence dollars and going back over the six or seven years now really got about close to anything like that, usually going into the quarter usually doing about somewhere between let\u2019s say 50 million or 55 million. So how did you ever get through high-end number and then alternatively maybe if you could comment on why there would be a possibility of product revenue down 22 million quarter-to-quarter from an absolute numbers standpoint?","George Kurian","We were taking a broader range. We look back and there are quarters where we were up sequentially, probably not as high as what you are quoting on product revenue, but we wanted to give a wide berth both ways and it's just really being conservative. You saw in Q2, we gave that same for rest of the 150 million we hit it spot on so. I think there -- it is a difficult environment its unpredictable and we\u2019ll try to make sure we\u2019re in the range somewhere close to that point.","Louis Miscioscia ","Maybe just following on the past question, do you -- some are not predicting your budget plus as they finish the year are you getting any visibility to that one way or another realized your quarter into January?","George Kurian","Difficult to tell as different customers in different markets, in different geographies. Certainly sometime certain customers have December as their yearend not all customers obviously and then as we said our quarter ends in January.","Louis Miscioscia ","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Simona Jankowski ","I just had a follow-up first or a clarification on the improvement in product gross margin. Can you just unpack for us what drove that, to the extent some of that was from the perhaps slightly more benign pricing environment versus the cost reductions you've been implementing versus mix because I'm just trying to get to the go forward and how many of those drivers might be permanent. And then I just wanted to follow up on the comment you made about better exposure or greater exposure to hyper scale customers. Could you quantify for us roughly what percent of your revenue now goes into those kinds of customers? Thank you.","Ron Pasek","Look, Simona. I think if you look, we do have -- tender to have a seasonal bump up in product gross margin from Q1 to Q2. You can call it customer mix if you\u2019d like, so that's what, what you saw to a largest that, but part of that will continue in Q3, but not to the same extent also in Q3 what we have is higher products revenue which puts a little pressure on the overall margin rate.","George Kurian","I think in aggregate Simona what we are doing in that to address gross margins is both continued to drive transformation into our services business which has allowed us to improve the gross margins of that business over the last few quarters. And on the product side being delivered about the use of promotions as well as improving the pricing and discounting approaches in our transactions. So we will -- we\u2019re generally focused in gross margin in aggregate and we have enough leverage to keep the gross margin within the ranges that we shared with you.","In terms of the hyper scale question, what I was referring to was the fact that we are building hybrid IT solutions that combined on premises data centers with the data enter and IT architectures of the hyper scale providers. This includes solutions like NetApp private storage for secure cloud storage. It includes solutions like the AltaVault solution and it includes the use of our software as part of hyper scale market places. And what they are doing is, while that part of our business is not material, they are allowing us to win on premises transactions because of a compelling forward looking hybrid IT roadmap that customers can buy into.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","David Ryzhik","This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini, thanks so much for taking the question. What percent of cDOT shipments in the quarter were all flash FAS? And regarding ONTAP 9, how much of a factors is that in your migration from 7 mode to cDOT? And do you think there was some customer cause ahead of ONTAP 9 and should ONTAP 9 catalyze additional migration? Thanks so much.","George Kurian","I would say that in terms of the all flash FAS solutions, all of the all flash FAS solutions are based on clustered ONTAP as an operating system. And so they count towards our aggregate clustered ONTAP numbers, they are a growing percentage of the clustered ONTAP business, not yet the majority. So we have room to go.","In terms of the installed base, there are a variety of reasons why customers choose to migrate from 7 mode to clustered ONTAP and flash is certainly an important part of that transition. The fact that we have a very compelling all flash FAS solution is encouraging customers to move in some cases their upgrade schedules up.","David Ryzhik","Great thanks. And regarding ONTAP 9, have you seen that drive any incremental interest from 7 mode customers?","George Kurian","ONTAP 9 continues to provide compelling technology for customer of both traditional NetApp customers as well as net new to NetApp customers. The combination of scalable mass containers, volume granular inscription on parallel storage efficiency and performance together with the new platform that we recently announced, all give customers more reason to upgrade from 7 mode to cDOT or for competitors to come to us. So we feel very good about the progress we have made.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your lien is now open.","Steven Fox","Just on the topline outlook for the quarter, you\u2019ve accelerated the return of year-over-year growth by that a quarter versus what you said on the prior call. So I was just curious what was the main two or three drivers in sort of pulling in that return of year-over-year growth into this current quarter? Thanks.","George Kurian","We have always said that we -- our plan was to return the company to growth in aggregate in fiscal '18 and that we would -- our plan was to return product revenue to growth in the second half of this year; we're on plans for that and we feel even more confident than we were a few quarters ago both because the mature products are stabilizing in terms of their go forward as well as the strength of our strategic solutions.","Steven Fox","So, there's not one or two things you would say, probably bigger drivers, as obviously I think most people are thinking that was going to happen in the fourth quarter so. I'm just curious if there's something that you would say has increase our confidence more than other things.","George Kurian","I would just say our aggregate execution against the plan and the fact that we've been consistently meeting expectations. So I think that's the real basis for where we are and as I said the mature products are less material a part of our business and the majority of the declines are behind us and the strategic solutions continue to perform well. So, we got to keep our head down and execute the plan. And I would just tell you that's my focus right now.","Operator","Our next comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sherri Scribner","I was hoping you could provide us with some additional detail on the SolidFire business, how much did that grow in the quarter and do you expect that to continue to be significant growth driver?","George Kurian","SolidFire is as we've outlined an important part of the focus and investment for us because it allows our customers to build architectures for their next generation data centers with us that they can't with anyone else. As we laid out at the time of the acquisition of SolidFire, SolidFire would contribute about 2% to our revenue for this year and would offset the OpEx operating margin by roughly 2% and I would tell you that we're on track to those plans. We've been gaining new customers to NetApp using SolidFire, we've been introducing NetApp customers to SolidFire and we're executing according to plan that we laid out. So, this is all about where we are with SolidFire.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Andy Nowinski","It looks like the only region or vertically you had year-over-year growth in this quarter was the U.S. public sector; just wondering if you could give us any more color on that growth whether the budget for us was larger this year than last year or whether you gained share in the space?","George Kurian","Public sectors procurement cycle was according to what we had thought and according to -- was in alignment with plan, we didn't see any unusual activity upward or downward in the public sector market, we have continued to execute well to capture the share of opportunities that are out there and so I would just say it is the budget flush that we saw in public sector was normal.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Maynard Um","Can you clarify whether there was any product gross margin benefit from the shift in marketing that you talked about last year and it seems like you see scope for more improvement in product cost going forward partially from marketing shift, also from restructuring, can you just talk about how you prioritize gross margin improvement versus market share gain, I heard you mention that you're hopeful this is the bottom in product gross margin.","I guess I'm asking the opposite question as we look forward in our modeling, should we be looking at product gross margins going up, going forward mix aside or will you sort of trade that for revenue market share gain? Thanks.","George Kurian","We would just in aggregate we operate to the gross margin guidance that we have laid out and it's a combination of improvements in service and product gross margins I would say right now what we\u2019re focused on is capturing footprint with our All-Flash-Array's as well as converting customers and facilitating the conversion of customers from 7-Mode to Clustered ONTAP. We\u2019ve said that we have put in place promotions that facilitate both of those objectives that are strategic to the company in the market and we constantly monitor the value of those promotions and their impact in terms of achieving our strategic objectives. ","The product innovations that we have made over the last year and a half continue to provide us with a really solid platform for differentiations and so any point in time we reserve the right to continue those promotions or to remove them from the marketplace and we constantly trade off the benefits of those with the benefits to improvements in gross margin.","Ron Pasek","Just to be little clear, on the services side is where are you seen most of the improvements we've made that will be a transformation. So that to some extent helps with the gross margin overall in the last couple of quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital. Your line is now open.","Tim Long","George, you mentioned the geographic performance tracking with what we're seeing from a macro standpoint. Could you talk a little bit about EMEA and APAC? It looks like the last few quarters they probably lagged the performance in North America, the Americas, at least on a year-over-year basis. Anything to that from your product standpoint or execution standpoint? And how should we think about those starting to catch up? Thank you.","George Kurian","I would say that in EMEA and APAC they are vastly different geographies with different macroeconomic situations. I think that we have seen strength in certain parts of EMEA and APAC where the economic landscape has stayed relatively benign and we have gained share in those environments. In others where there is more uncertainty, you see that impacting transactions and so we've had to compete to maintain share and we have done a good job doing that.","I would say that we're going to wait to see what the economic outlook looks for those companies and we have built a fairly conservative outlook into our guidance. And so we continue to focus on gaining share wherever we can gain share, but do so with an outlook that builds into the forecast that the macroeconomic situation in those countries. Emerging markets is the same which falls into our Americas geography. The preponderant part of the Latin American geographies are in our Americas business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street Capital. Your line is now open.","Eric Martinuzzi ","Yes, just curious in working with your channel partners, there was -- some of your channel partners have been representing maybe competitive All-Flash-Arrays out in the markets. What incentives or what steps are you taking so -- maybe for an account that isn\u2019t kind of a NetApp installed base where an [technical difficulty] from NetApp would be a layup, kind of a Greenfield opportunity. What are you doing to get it -- make that a NetApp install as oppose to a competitive product install with your channel partners?","George Kurian","I think its starts with the customer, it starts with making sure customers understand the value of NetApp technology and I think we\u2019ve made substantial progress there. Analyst commentary customer references the portfolio of products from NetApp and our intense focus on raising our profile in the All-Flash-Array markets, as well as candidly the success and momentum that we\u2019ve demonstrated substantially outpacing the market as well as our peers gives us access to more customer conversations than we\u2019ve ever had before.","Some of that also is reaching those customers through new low cost innovative digital marketing channels which our Chief Marketing Officer is an expert that doing. And then the third is enabling the channel so that they focus their attention on NetApp portfolio. I think we\u2019re using all of those levers, and we feel good about the progress, this is an unending -- I would just tell you this is an ongoing game, right. So as I\u2019ve said on my call, we are very pleased with the momentum, but we\u2019re going to keep our heads down and we\u2019ve got more work to do and we\u2019re doing that every single day, staying focus on execution.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Katy Huberty","Question about support attached to the strategic business versus mature. Curious whether there is a different dynamic or attach rate, because hardware maintenance is down year-on-year and differed revenue declined more than seasonal this quarter despite the fact that install base is growing. So just trying to understand that implications for the maintenance business? Thanks.","George Kurian","There is no difference in the attach rate between a strategic and mature. We are still, as you said, seeing a growth in installed base, although it is a little bit slow. What we have is very, very good growth in obviously the new cDOT products. But as you recognized product revenues for the last couple of quarters have declined, that puts a little pressure on that install base, but it is growing.","Deferred is growing significantly year-over-year, there were some seasonal things that happened quarter-to-quarter, remember renewals -- it's must be renewals, and those happened to a large extend in the second half of the year. So that leaves a little bit of a trough in the first half.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of James Kisner of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is [indiscernible] on for James Kisner. George, you mentioned 3D NAND roadmap and your flash business is doing really well, but are you seeing any negative impact from NAND shortage this year, and I don\u2019t know what's your visibility into NAND pricing, are you signing a long term contracts?","Ron Pasek","We are able to secure what we need for NAND, it is a tight supply. No one is signing long term contracts right now. So I think we\u2019re able to get what we need and prices are tight.","George Kurian","I think and just to add to Ron's comments, I think ensuring supply is the combination of both technological as well as commercial relationships with the NAND suppliers and we have excellent relationships with multiple of them. So we feel good about where we're at but it is constrained market.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Kris Newton for any closing remarks.","Kris Newton","And I'll hand it over to George.","George Kurian","I wanted to just summarize the comments that I made at the start. I'm pleased with the progress that we've made both in the top line and the strategic portfolio of products that align with our customers priorities as well as with the productivity and efficiency of our business. We are increasingly confident to bring additional innovation to customers, add new customers, working with the hyperscale ecosystem that drives the next generation of IT as well as transforming to be a more agile, focused and faster moving company.","We have achieved an enormous amount of progress and I want to thank the NetApp team and are closer to returning the company to growth than we have been in a longtime. We have more work to do to bring excellence to all facets of our business and we're going to stay focused and deliver yet another quarter of meeting our commitments to our shareholders. Thank you and we'll see you on the next call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude your program. You may all disconnect.

Welcome to NetApp's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.","I would now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","Kris Newton","Thank you for joining us on our Q3 fiscal year 2018 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com, along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table, and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018 and our expectations regarding the repatriation of cash, future revenue, profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections.","Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including global political macroeconomic and market conditions and our ability to expand our total available market, enhance our product offerings, execute new business models, manage our gross profit margins, capitalize on our market position, maintain execution, and continue our capital allocation strategy.","Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2017 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated.","I'll now turn the call over to George.","George Kurian","Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. In the third fiscal quarter, NetApp delivered strong results, with all key financial metrics in line with or above our guidance.","We again saw a solid demand environment and customer momentum, landing wins and footprint expansions with leading organizations in all geographies.","Before discussing our continued progress, I want to thank the NetApp team and all of our partners for their high level of execution and commitment to delivering against our goals.","I also want to let you know that we will hold a Financial Analyst Day in New York City on April 5, where we will share more detail on the evolution of NetApp as the data authority for the hybrid cloud.","Now I will discuss the results of the quarter. It is rewarding to see the success of our improved execution as we transform NetApp to deliver sustained and profitable growth. Our momentum is fueled by our alignment with customer's interest in leveraging data for business impact and by their preference for our scale, innovation and strategic focus.","In the third quarter, we expanded our cloud infrastructure and cloud data services offerings, most notably introducing NetApp Cloud Volumes for Amazon Web Services and support for VMware on AWS. With our Data Fabric strategy and industry leading solutions, we are creating new customer and business opportunities.","Organizations that are undergoing digital transformation, leveraging the Internet of Things and technologies, like analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence to radically improve their business performance.","Data is the heart of these digital transformations. NetApp is uniquely positioned as the leader in helping organizations liberate their data for maximum business impact. In the data-driven digital era, customers require solutions for a complex world, where data resides in the data center, in multiple clouds, at the enterprise edge and in externally linked applications and platforms.","Our competitors are struggling to adapt to this new era of IT, and lacking a deeply cloud-integrated strategy will continue to fall behind. With the NetApp Data Fabric, we help customers simplify and integrate data management across multiple clouds, data centers and Edge to accelerate digital transformation and address their top IT imperatives, modernizing storage through data management, building next-generation data centers and harnessing the power of the hybrid cloud.","Our focus enables us to accelerate growth by prioritizing investments and execution against the biggest opportunities. This success of our strategic direction is evident in the continued momentum in our strategic solutions, which was 70% of net product revenue in Q3, up 26% year-over-year.","As we indicated on our last call, headwinds from mature solutions have abated. In Q3, mature solutions contributed 30% of net product revenue, flat year-over-year. The shift to flash creates enormous new opportunity for us as we consolidate and displace competitor's legacy equipment, gain share in new workload deployments and upgrade our install base.","Our cloud-integrated all-flash solutions help customers modernize their IT environment and consolidate second and third platform workloads to meet the growing demands of performance and data intensive applications, like analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.","In Q3, our all-flash array business, inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services, grew almost 50% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2 billion. Our strength in flash is also driving our success in the SAN and converged infrastructure markets.","With our highly successful competitive takeout program, we, again, averaged two predominantly SAN competitive displacements per day. This is enabling us to gain share in the SAN market, both in new customer acquisitions and in greater share of wallet within existing customers.","As customers build cloud architected data centers to deliver cloud services for next-generation applications in either private or service provider models, they are increasingly turning to the simpler deployment models of converged and hyperconverged infrastructure.","Driven by the strength of the all-flash FlexPod, we grew more than 50% year-over-year in the converged infrastructure market and are gaining share for IDC's quarterly converged system tracker for calendar Q3 2017.","With the recent announcement of NFLEX converged infrastructure with Fujitsu, we expect further share gains by expanding our reach to the customers with whom Fujitsu has built relationships and loyalty.","Momentum with NetApp HCI, which we began, shipping at the end of Q2, is progressing to plan. Our initial focus on expanding share of wallet with existing customers by addressing new workloads and buyers is working. At a global automotive company, we won a seven figure HCI deal, supporting a three-site VMware server virtualization environment.","We won against the leading first generation HCI player because of the strength of our solution, data fabric integration and track record for customer success. We continue to see strong demand for this offering, driven by customer excitement for our enterprise grade approach, with the ability to flex, storage, and compute separately and to support mixed workloads confidently.","More and more, customers and partners want to work with us because of our cloud strategy. Our rich portfolio of cloud data services enables customer's cloud, hybrid cloud and the multi-cloud strategies, the private preview for our industry first announcement with Microsoft Azure for Azure filed by NetApp, is oversubscribed with customers who are strategically focused on leveraging the Azure cloud.","Early customer feedback has been very positive due to the simplicity and performance of the solution. As planned, Microsoft is leading the primary engagement with customers, enabling us to reach outside of our base to cloud-only buyers.","In Q3, we announced NetApp Cloud Volumes for AWS, currently in private preview. This new service available in the Amazon marketplace offers high levels of performance and availability to speed enterprise applications, including analytics, DevOps, backup and disaster recovery.","We have also seen a high level of customer interest in this offering and expect both Azure filed by NetApp and NetApp Cloud Volumes for AWS to be in public preview before the end of this fiscal year.","Our cloud data services allow us to monetize customer's use of the cloud and increase our opportunity to expand our market share in on-premises deployments. As I said last quarter, I could not be more excited about the possibilities created here.","We will have more details about how we see this part of our business unfolding, and if contribution to our business model at our Financial Analyst Day. We are building on a solid foundation that's generating profitable growth today and positions us for continued growth in the future.","As we move through the second phase of our transformation, we remain focused on three priorities. First, aligning to the high-growth areas of the market and reaching more customers in more ways. The size and growth of our strategic product revenue attest to our success here.","Second, continuing our disciplined approach to realign our resources against the biggest opportunities and to focus on productivity while expanding our innovation. As we pivot towards new markets and engage new customers, we continue to realign resources and prioritize investments to stay focused and ensure we are well positioned for the future.","And third, maintaining our focus on capital allocation, balancing shareholder returns with investment in the business for long-term growth. We'll gain added flexibility from Tax Reform and we'll have more on this topic at our Financial Analyst Day.","Our strong Q3 performance reflects our customers and channel partners confidence in NetApp and their clear and growing preference for the value of our Data Fabric strategy. We are building deeper and more strategic relationships with companies around the world. Our expertise in data management, leadership in growing market segment and open ecosystem approach is unmatched.","We have a fundamental strategic advantage, created by decades of customer understanding, software-based innovation, focus and the ability to partner effectively, and we continue to out-execute the competition on all fronts.","As you see in our guidance, we expect our momentum to continue in Q4. As the data authority for the hybrid cloud, we are planning for the future, expanding our total available market and creating shareholder value by leveraging our technologies and scale to create new businesses and customer relationships.","I will now turn the call over to Ron.","Ronald Pasek","Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers, unless otherwise noted.","Our Q3 results speak to our successful pivot to the growth areas of the market, supported by our industry-leading innovation and execution. I'm proud of our team's hard work and sharp focus, delivering consistently against our commitments.","Net revenues of $1.52 billion grew 8% year-over-year, driven by strong product revenue and a two-point currency tailwind. Product revenue of $920 million increased more than 17% year-over-year, reflecting the strength of our strategic products, as well as a 3.5 point currency benefit. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year product revenue growth.","The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue of $603 million declined about 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially due to lower revenue from renewals.","However, we saw healthy growth in deferred and financed unearned services revenue, which increased 1% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The maintenance attached rates to new product sales remains consistent and we saw healthy growth in our installed base.","Gross margin was 62.6%, product gross margin of 50.2% increased 4.5 points year-over-year, reflecting the benefit from reduced promotions, some onetime items and currency. Both of software maintenance, gross margin and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin were relatively flat year-over-year.","Operating expenses of $644 million were flat sequentially and increased 11% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was due almost entirely to higher variable compensation expense, associated with our over-performance and to a lesser extent, merit and currency.","Excluding these items, OpEx would have been flat year-over-year, reflecting our continued strong discipline. As a percentage of net revenue, operating expense of 42% were roughly flat compared to the same period last year. Operating margin of 20.4% was flat year-over-year as well.","Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 276 million. EPS was $0.99. We benefited from a lower tax rate and higher other income from onetime currency gains on balance sheet items, excluding these items, EPS would have been $0.92.","Now I'll briefly discuss the implications of the new U.S. Tax Reform Act on FY '18. We have lowered our full year effective tax rate to 18%, reflecting 4 months of benefit of the new tax rate. As a result, we made a year-to-date true-up, yielding a Q3 effective tax rate of 15.7%.","In addition, we recorded a discrete GAAP tax expense of about $860 million due to the new U.S. Tax Reform Act, which includes the transition tax related to the deemed repatriation of our foreign earnings. This charge resulted in a GAAP net loss of $506 million.","We closed Q3 with $5.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. To reiterate what I said on our last earnings call, the domestic cash balance at the end of Q2 was temporarily higher due to the additional $800 million of bonds that we issued in late September to retire the bonds we have coming due in December.","In Q3, on November 3, we early retired the $750 million in bonds, resulting in the decrease of onshore cash. Finally, as a result of tax reform, we plan to repatriate over $4 billion of foreign cash over the next 12 months.","We remain committed to the same capital return philosophy that I outlined during last year's Analyst Day, and will provide-specific capital allocation plans during this year's Analyst Day in April.","Our cash conversion cycle of negative 11 days improved 28 days year-over-year, reflecting a 30-day increase in days payable outstanding and a six day decrease in days inventory outstanding, partially offset by a six day increase in DSO due to some timing issues.","We had another outstanding quarter of cash generation, with cash flow from operations of $420 million, an increase of 79% year-over-year. We generated strong free cash flow of $388 million in the quarter, which represented 25% of net revenues and is an increase of 104% year-over-year.","In Q3, we repurchased $150 million of our shares and paid approximately $53 million in cash dividends. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which will be paid on April 25, 2018. We remain committed to completing, by the end of May 2018, the remaining $344 million of the share repurchase program that we announced in February 2015.","Now onto guidance. For Q4, we expect net revenues to range between $1.525 billion and $1.675 billion, which at the midpoint, implies an 8% increase year-over-year, including a 2 point currency benefit. We expect Q4 consolidated gross margins of approximately 61.5% to 62.5%, reflecting a higher mix of product revenue sequentially.","We expect operating margins to range between 20% and 21%. While we don't explicitly guide OpEx, the implied Q4 year-over-year increase is driven by currency, variable compensation, merit and a small severance charge. And finally, we expect earnings per share for the fourth quarter to range between $0.95 to $1.03 per share.","Now let's step back and look at our implied FY '18 results. Based on our Q3 year-to-date results and the mid-point of our Q4 guidance range, you can see tremendous leverage in our business model.","On a year-over-year basis, our projected 6% revenue growth and 8% gross margin growth yield an 18% increase in operating income and a 25% increase in EPS. We are well positioned to deliver on our commitments, and expect continued progress in Q4. I look forward to seeing you in April at our Financial Analyst Day.","With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?","Kris Newton","We'll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thank you. Ron, your product revenue showed some strong quarter-on-quarter growth, but product gross margins came in 160 basis points weaker. I know last quarter you had a 50 basis point purchase price variance.","Can you bridge the moving pieces here, is this more discounting, is it competitor response, is it just the mix in the quarter, or did the ATI ramp have anything to do with that? Thank you.","Ronald Pasek","Sure. Wamsi, I mentioned when I guided last quarter, that we did have some one-time benefits in Q2. Those didn't recur obviously in Q3. And we did have a little bit of higher discounting, which we normally see seasonally in Q3. That's really it.","Wamsi Mohan","And do you expect that to persist on ongoing basis? Looks like your guides relatively flat on gross margins? And how should we think about that trajectory, given some of the commentary around the software contribution of ONTAP Cloud and potentially the increasing mix of that over time?","Ronald Pasek","Yeah. I'm only going to talk about Q4, but it's implied in the total margin guide and you're right, that we're roughly flat for product margins quarter-to-quarter implied in that total margin guide.","I think you've got to go out and you have to wait until Analyst Day to have us give implications for some of the monetization of our Cloud business. So I'm not going to talk about that - this early.","Wamsi Mohan","Thanks, Ron.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Wamsi. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland of Baird. Your line is open.","Jayson Noland","Okay, super. I wanted to ask on hardware maintenance. That was down a little again on a fairly easy comp. Any more color you can add there? And then just generally, how should we model that going forward?","George Kurian","Yeah. So we were down a little bit, but as I said, we saw an increase in deferred revenue, which is a precursor to see that part of the business return to growth. And I have said this year, as we went through the year, the headwind would lessen. That's still what we would like to see. And going out to next year, we're going to give you a little more color at Analyst Day about what you should model next year.","But as I said, remember, the installed base is growing, increasing significant product revenue growth, and that's starting to accumulate in the installed base for both point-of-sale and ultimately renewals.","Jayson Noland","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Jayson. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your question please.","Andrew Nowinski","Great. Thanks for taking the question, and great quarter. So I wanted to ask about your U.S. commercial revenue. It was up, it looks like about 8.5% year-over-year, which is the highest it's been since FY '12, and your strategic revenue growth also accelerated this quarter off a pretty difficult comp.","So can you just give us any color as to what's driving the strong demand specifically in that region, in the commercial segment, as well as you know, were there any new product like HCI - helped that growth rate in the quarter?","George Kurian","The strategic product revenue growth continues to reflect both our alignment with customer's spending priorities and the fact that we are gaining share in all of the fast growing markets at the expense of competition. So we feel very good about our progress.","I think with regard to hyper-converged as we mentioned, we are very excited about the momentum. We're off to a strong start. Customer demand is reflecting the position and value of our solution, and we are focused on gaining share in that market as well.","Andrew Nowinski","Great. Thanks.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Andy. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your question please.","Aaron Rakers","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I can appreciate that you're having an Analyst Day in early April, but I'm just curious, how you guys think about your capital allocation. You're bringing $4 billion of cash back onshore. In the past, you've talked about driving to as much as a 3% dividend.","So I'm just curious - can you give us any qualitative or even quantitative color on how you think we should think about capital allocation? Or may be taken another way, of how much cash you really believe the business requires to run optimally?","Ronald Pasek","Yeah. So I'll just reiterate what I said almost a year ago, which is - we do want to increase the dividend significantly. That's likely to be something we announced in Analyst Day. As you know, we nearly done with our current share authorization repurchase. Undoubtedly, we'll probably announce another significant share repurchase.","And what I also talked about was de-levering and that's probably something we'll do a little bit of. We still want some debt in our capital structure. And just to reiterating what we said, this doesn't change how we think about in organic growth. So just having cash onshore doesn't change our idea of what makes sense from an inorganic standpoint.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. Thank you very much.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Aaron. Next question.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. Your question please.","Joe Wittine","Hey, guys. Nice quarter. While your results, obviously, indicate you're taking share from the legacy competition, I guess we got to ask again because you're largest competitor is again doubling down on investing and storage resources.","So curious on your take there, George and specifically, whether you see any risk that competition could intensify to the point of impacting gross margin? Thanks.","George Kurian","I think the competition has always been fierce. I think that our largest competitor's remains a formidable one. They have fundamental product portfolio challenges and the lack of cloud story. So it's not just a matter of hiring people or throwing incentives at the channel like they've been that's going to turn around their business.","They've got to fundamentally rationalize a completely confusing product portfolio. They lack a competitive flash offering with a road map to the future, and they've got to get a cloud story. So lots of work to do on their side. They'd rather be in my shoes than in theirs. In response to refuse to lose, we'll just say, we refuse to stop quitting.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Joe. How about the next question?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could provide a little more detail on the competitive environment specifically for the hyper-converged product? I know you mentioned that the product is doing well. But curious how you're stacking up against Nutanix and SimpliVity?","And then just generally the competitive environment you mentioned it's competitive. But we've heard some things about AMC not doing well, would be helpful to get some additional color? Thanks.","George Kurian","The hyper-converged market, I think, will have different use cases over a period of time. We are focused on the enterprise use cases of hyper-converged, where customers want to deploy an infrastructure for enterprise applications, which have guaranteed performance, scalability and predictability and our architecture is resonating for those use cases.","We are positioned to scale, compute and storage separately from each other. We use industry standard, networking interfaces and all of those have led us to be off to a very good start.","We have more work to do to expand the range of customers. But the points of differentiation that we have articulated prior to the product launch are proving out in the transactions that we're competing for.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks, Sherri. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kurtz of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Alex Kurtz","Yes. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Ron, just on discounting comment earlier in the Q&A. And I think the expectation in the market that memory and NAND costs are going to see some improvement this year. What's your view on those dynamics playing out in product margins over the next couple of quarters?","Ronald Pasek","We've talked about this, you know, as you saw last year when NAND prices rose, we chose to raise all this price. And in most cases, try to pass that on to our customers. By the same token, should we see significant decreases in NAND prices, we would probably do as well price decreases.","However, remember, DRAM is getting quite expensive, so we balanced it with that. Absent timing issues, you really don't see an impact because of NAND memory. We really kind of make it neutral.","George Kurian","I think if you see decreases in NAND pricing, I think from a product mix shift, we'll be testing customers deploy more all-flash arrays. I think given the substantial differentiation that we have in that segment, it allows us to capture new footprints and competitive - accelerate competitive placements even faster than we are today.","So we are excited of the prospect of NAND pricing coming back in line through this latter part of the summer.","Alex Kurtz","Thanks.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Alex. Next question","Operator","Next question comes from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Rod Hall","Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions. Sorry, I just want to quickly come back to the discounting point. You said it was seasonal. Could you just articulate why that seasonality tends to be the case? May be just kind of give us a little bit of background?","And then I also wanted to ask, we know there's a lot of potential demand from AI workloads for FAS, and wonder if you can comment on what you're actually seeing in the market? Are you seeing traction on those kind of workloads today in your numbers? Do you expect to see a lot of growth from that area over the next, let's say, 12 months or so? Thanks.","Ronald Pasek","So it's seasonal in the sense that last quarter is the large, US public sector quarter. We typically see little higher margin elevation in there, and it received a little bit in Q3. That's really all we see- and we saw and we actually forecasted that. That was baked into the guide I gave.","George Kurian","With regard to artificial intelligence and machine learning, one of the fundamental underpinnings of an AI environment is having a large amount of data that you can use to train the algorithms that are being developed for machine learning.","And with our technology, we are seeing customers start to build out those environments either on-premises alongside GPU stacks from people like NVIDIA or on the cloud as part of our cloud services portfolio.","And so we feel well positioned to capture those deployments as they come, because we are the only vendor that can do that either on-prem or on the cloud, and we're excited at that possibility.","Rod Hall","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Rod. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess, maybe just to clarify, Ron. When you talked about the 18% tax rate, was that a fiscal '18 statement? Or does that apply to fiscal '19 as well is a right way model it, so I just wanted to clarify that.","And I guess, just from a question perspective, George, you talked about partnerships with hyperscale customers like Microsoft and Azure and Amazon AWS. I think it's fairly unique that you guys to do this versus your peers at least.","So can you maybe talk about what sort of revenue or TAM opportunity do you see over here? And in these instances the customers do end up using your products, what are they displacing or what are you offsetting at that point?","Ronald Pasek","So to the first part of your question. Yeah, the 18% was for FY '18 only. We'll give you more information on what likely is to transpire with our future tax rate at our Analyst Day.","George Kurian","With regard to the question on the cloud data services, yes, we are clearly differentiated in the market because we are the only technology provider that can give the customer the choice of where to deploy their technology, either in their data center, in a co-location provide facility on their edge or in the cloud.","With regard to the work we're doing, we are very excited. These solutions are in private preview, meaning, pre-commercial. It will be available later this year in the commercial form. And so for Q4, we see acceleration of our momentum without any contribution from these cloud data services.","We will tell you that we could not be more excited about the possibilities that these afford in terms of overall customer success and contribution to our business model, but we'll share more of those details at Financial Analyst Day.","With regard to what are they displacing, there are sort of two or three categories of choices that customers make. For new workloads that are being deployed on the cloud, where they need scale and efficiency, they are typically displacing a service that hyperscaler offers.","So for example, EFS from Amazon, customer will choose our storage services and data services because they're just much mature and much more high performance and scale better.","With regard to the use of the cloud, the second use might be to displace an on-premise environment and those could be from either a competitor of ours or from us, as they decide to move workloads.","And the third is to have a hybrid deployment, either across clouds or between a public cloud and the on-premises world, where we are increasingly winning on-premises market share at the expense of competitors who cannot offer a cloud offering.","So all of those of three, and we really feel like this will be a meaningful contribution to our business, particularly for our customers.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Amit. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a really solid quarter and on increasing momentum. I guess, George, this could be for George or Ron, or George and Ron. Just with regard to the April guide, it seems like - and I'm backing into this. But it seems like the strategic product revenue seasonality or guidance - sequential guidance for April is a little bit softer than what that was for the last two Aprils where you did kind of 15%, 16% growth. And given your tailwinds, I wouldn't have expected that.","So the question is, is there anything going on in an environment that would cause April seasonality for strategic to be a little softer than the last two years?","George Kurian","I don't think you should see that. I think when we look at the April quarter, we continue to see strength in our product business. I think the overall product revenue should continue to stay in the range of year-on-year growth that you see in the current quarter.","I think the mix between mature and strategic depends on the quarter. I think in the mature certain categories in mature are tied to the performance of our OEM business, which can vary quarter-to-quarter. So I don't think you should - we don't see any slowdown in our strategic momentum whatsoever.","Ananda Baruah","Thanks, George. That's really helpful. Appreciate it.","George Kurian","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Ananda. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","Thanks very much. I have a clarification question then the main question. The clarification question is I think I've heard you say you'll talk about stock buyback, dividend, capital funds at your Investor Day. If that's true, I guess the question is why is this something unique or complicated and needs more time to iron it all out while other companies' reports have already given such guidance?","And the question I have is on the deferred revenues. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what's going on there as far as any impact of it to the cash flow statement as we see those changes in the flow through the cash flow? Thank you.","George Kurian","We always planned to articulate the capital return at Analyst Day. It coincides with the disclosures and meetings we have internally. But again, we gave you a guidance on that subject 10 months ago, and we're going to be consistent with that guidance.","So you're right, anytime we increase deferred revenue that usually means we get cash up front. So, that - all things being equal, that would help cash flow, which it did last quarter a little bit as deferred increased to 1% year-over-year.","So that's right, that's exactly how we think about it. But we made more progress in other aspects of cash generation, mostly you can see them demonstrated in the cash conversion cycle, where we elongated DSO. We had a really good turns there for days of inventory.","We're quite low, and a little bit worse than DSO, but it's a focus here for the company, and we've been negative in the cash conversion for the past two quarters.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much for the details and clarification,","Kris Newton","Thank you, Jim. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is open.","Mark Moskowitz","Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Kind of continue with that thread about the hump of the analyst meeting. I guess, the guidance seems a little conservative versus what investors it appears were expecting for the April quarter.","Is there any sort of dimension here you want to kind of unpacked in terms of how much of that is conservatism versus how the channel respond to the Dell EMC or just waiting until April 5th when you guys unpack each more of the cloud opportunity? Just play kind of hide and seek here.","George Kurian","So I think if you look at consensus, we actually guided the top line above consensus before the call. I'll probably spot on EPS, so I don't know view it as conservative at all. And then second question was?","Kris Newton","All right. I think Mark, the second part of your question was - is part of the reason why we're waiting to see the impact of Dell EMC?","Ronald Pasek","No. no it's just - we've been consisted with the guidance we've given all year. We've met or been in the range or beat them at every quarter. And we don't consistently try to be conservative. We're trying to be realistic. And we try to deliver consistent results and that's exactly what we've been doing.","George Kurian","We don't feel any concern from the Dell EMC move. As we said, I think they have always been a formidable competitor, but they have a lot of fundamental issues unrelated to scale and distribution. They have fundamental product issues and alignment with customer road maps that take a long time to fix. So I don't think that we're, in any way, concerned about EMC.","We're going to continue to watch them, but we're not worried about the sentiment that they are creating. We feel good about our position, very good.","Kris Newton","All right. Well, thanks, Mark. Next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just I had a question on the OpEx line. So obviously, we're going to wait until the meeting for specifics on that. But as you mentioned, excluding some comp issues and currencies, you're pretty flat on that, and you're still reworking how OpEx is sort of allocated between growth and mature areas.","So can you give us a sense of - obviously, not going into to the numbers. Just sort of how far long you are on that journey and what kind of opportunities you need still to be pursuing over the next 12 months? Thanks.","Ronald Pasek","So I think at the highest level, what we said last year at Analyst Day is that for FY '19 and '20, we plan to self-fund our merit increase where you saw a bump up this year in FY '18. There's a little bit of headwind next year as it relates to FX. But that's still the commitment that we're driving to get the leverage out of the business model.","Steven Fox","And so there are still ongoing shift going on within the business and over the next year prospect is similar to what we saw so far?","Ronald Pasek","Yeah. We - exactly, we've been really clear that transformation is not an event. It's something we're doing ongoing. You can see that this quarter we had a small separate charger that's part evidence of that transformation.","We continue to make changes of that you don't see in our total results, but internally, there's lots of trade-offs, lots of investment and disinvestment and we'll continue to do that and will for probably forever.","Steven Fox","Great. Thanks for the color.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks, Steven. Next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is open.","Steve Milunovich","Great. Thank you. George, could you talk a bit about the go-to market this year? I think this is the first fiscal year that unable to implement the changes that Andrea is been able to implement the changes that he wanted to make. What are those changes in sales and marketing? And are you seeing the effect?","George Kurian","I think we've been very pleased with the breadth and the performance of the theaters and geographies, as we mentioned in my prepared remarks. We're seeing strengths across segments, geographies and there's really good momentum of our strategic product portfolio. So we want to thank our sales leadership and our sales teams for that.","I think we continue to focus in on where - how to align our resources against the biggest opportunities. As we rollout new innovations with cloud providers and hyper-converged to make sure that we've got our best resources aligned against the biggest customer segments and opportunities, that's a work that we'll continue, as Ron said, through next year.","But overall, we're very excited at the momentum. 26% year-on-year growth in strategic products is a really good benchmark. And for mature to reach stabilization, gives us a lot of confidence looking forward. And we're really excited to finish the year and a step into the next year.","Steve Milunovich","In the past, I think you have said that you're under penetrated to some degree in the largest accounts. Are you seeing some success there?","George Kurian","Yeah. As the Run to NetApp campaign, which is one of our competitive programs, continues to be very strong. I think the resellers, who sell to the enterprise, also have given us really good feedback on the momentum of our portfolio.","And finally, as we bring the cloud service providers into the market with our technology, we will be able to access buying centers and wallets in those accounts that are not available to traditional infrastructure providers.","So we feel very, very good. We're well positioned, and we continue to gain share and stay focused on that.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks, Steve. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Srini Nandury of Summit Insights Group. Your line is open.","Srini Nandury","All right. Thank you for taking my question. George, a bigger picture perspective, are virtual storage devices being replaced by HCI devices and more importantly the HCI devices from you or from your competitors is going to the new workloads or going to existing workloads? Thank you.","George Kurian","There's a certainly an element of HCI workloads that are replacing SAN environments. An HCI environment is a way to displace a more traditional cyber channel environment with an Ethernet-based simplified storage landscape. The HCI environments today are being deployed.","Traditionally Gen 1 HCI was for a standalone VDI, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure use case. There was not as much for mixed workloads. But as we bring enterprise-grade HCI into the market, people are deploying multi-use workloads on top of HCI.","So we feel that it's a new set opportunities for us to go capture and that we're very pleased with the start that we've had. We've got more work to do, but we're off to a really good start.","Srini Nandury","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Srini. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Mark Kelleher of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Mark Kelleher","Great. Thank you for taking the questions. I was wondering, as your cloud data services ramps, can you tell us what the impacts you expect on the maintenance lines or software and the hardware lines as we go forward? Is there anything changed in how that attach rates, right?","And then if I could slip a quick clarification into, Ron, the receivable spike, you mentioned some timing issues. Could you just say what those were? Thanks.","Ronald Pasek","Yeah. Let's start with your last question first. So, I think, what we had last quarter was fairly linear shipments, but we had certain customers that were early payers that occurred earlier in the quarter than usual.","So that left a little bit of a timing issue. It's not something - we don't have an escalation and elongation in receivables. So it's particularly well into caught up list related to what customers decided to pay.","George Kurian","With regard to the maintenance lines, it depends on the agreement that we have with the specific cloud provider. In the case of our partnership with Microsoft, Microsoft does the level one and level two support, and NetApp does the level three support. The solution starts out with the hardware, but should quickly transition to a software-only model. So it will be a very attractive business to us.","In the case of the solution, for example, with Amazon, we deploy the infrastructure of software, sell it through the Amazon marketplace and we get some maintenance revenue stream.","We have not seen any difference in the maintenance attach rates between our cloud services and on-premises technology, I think, so far. So we feel good about the business. We'll tell you more as it becomes - as we head into Analyst Day.","Mark Kelleher","Great. Thanks.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Mark. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Lou Miscioscia of Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.","Lou Miscioscia","Okay. Thanks, George. One of the insights, a couple of years ago, you talked about going on a limb or maybe you talk about your daughter actually anticipating that. So when we look forward, I think that the street numbers are pretty modest for growth, especially product growth, going out to fiscal 2018. And a couple of quarters ago, you did talk about double-digits and obviously, you now delivered that.","As we look forward, given that you've talked so well about your product positioning and obviously your competition having problems, I think you can get a double-digit product growth next year?","George Kurian","Listen, I think we'll tell you more about our outlook heading into next year. I think if you look at what we had told you for fiscal 2018, we had said that we were planning the business for low single-digit, but we had a lot of confidence to believe that we could outperform that number and we have been, right?","So this is a fifth consecutive quarter of product revenue growth year-on-year, and the numbers are very strong. I think that what you'll see from us is the ability to continue to stay disciplined on the operating expense line, while delivering strong top line performance. And we'll give you more details of that for what it means from fiscal 2019 onwards on Analyst Day.","But I'll just tell you that our confidence in our ability to drive product revenue growth to help accelerate the top line of the company is even stronger today than a few quarters ago.","Mature has started to stabilize, as we said, and the strength of our strategic product portfolio, both in terms of the markets we compete in as well as the new markets that we are stepping into, is evident. And I'll just leave it there, so thanks. We're excited.","Lou Miscioscia","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Lou. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","David Ryzhik","Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini. So it took you guys six quarters to get to a $1 billion run rate in all-flash. What do you think you can get to in six quarters in HCI?","And going back to all-flash, just wondering, any metrics you can share around E-series, whether that grew - outgrew your overall all-flash? And specifically, if you can touch on the EF570 the NVMe over fabric? Thanks so much.","George Kurian","So let me take on each of those. The NVMe over fabric technology, that's available in the E-series EF570. For NVMe over InfiniBand, we started to see some really good customer applications for it, targeting extremely high-performance analytics workloads for real-time analytics platforms, either in cloud service providers or in large-scale enterprise customers.","So we're - we feel good about that offering. I think the E-series broadly, the branded business did well. The OEM business depends on the quarter and the performance of the OEMs, as we've said, consistently.","I think with regard to the overall product portfolio that we talked about, again, we feel very good about the mix of business. I think with regard to the adoption of HCI, it's a little different than flash where are flash is essentially replacing one operational environment with another.","In the case of HCI, there are some environments where the decision-making body for buying a hyper-converged infrastructure is different from the one that buy standard storage, right.","So it may take a little bit longer to ramp, but the market is growing very quickly, so we'll have to wait and see. There's a lot of opportunity. We've got a good solution and we're going to compete like hell.","David Ryzhik","Thanks so much George.","Kris Newton","Thank you, David. Next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street. Your line is open.","Eric Martinuzzi","Yeah. The question is with the deal sizes, which is really more a reflection of maybe customer confidence. I'm wondering if you're seeing just because we've got so many different levers going on here, you're signing of new customers, you got installed base, but are you seeing deal sizes creep up?","George Kurian","I think in the solid state business, given the track record and the capability that we have, we continue to see bigger and bigger footprints coming our way at customers, where they are now displacing entire landscapes and standardizing on our flash technology as the platform.","I think in other cases, where it's still early like in the cloud, for example, we are in private preview, so we haven't yet started charged commercially. But you see people doing proofs of concepts and getting ready for commercial availability.","Eric Martinuzzi","And that's true both U.S.A. and international?","George Kurian","Correct.","Eric Martinuzzi","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Eric. Next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions. Ron, some of your partners talked about strong demand or budget flash at the end of the quarter and as a result, the tight component environment caused them to miss some business, which given that dynamic. Wonder if you saw either of those dynamics?","And then secondly, George, curious what you're hearing from your customers around Tax Reform, the impact of higher earnings flow-through and more cash onshore accelerated depreciation? Are your customers thinking that they can accelerate some of their IT spend and strategic projects around hybrid, Edge, AI, et cetera? Thank you.","Ronald Pasek","So Katy, as the first part of your question, we do not have a problem with components, particularly NAND or DRAM. We have already accessed checked out in my prepared remarks because it's really become a non-issue at this point. And you can see our performance for the last six quarters has been consistent in that respect.","George Kurian","With regard to the question you had about the impact of tax reform, I think we see that the improving economic outlook and consumer confidence is allowing customers to plan longer term. And so we are seeing people getting more definitive about what they want to do.","I also think that they are getting much clearer about what they want to do in the cloud and what they want to do consequently on-premises. So those are the two clearer driving factors we see.","And in certain cases like deployment of flash technology, there's a really hard return on investment that they can capture very quickly and those are all driving momentum in customer transactions.","Katy Huberty","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Katy. Next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Edward Parker of BTIG. Your line is open.","Edward Parker","Yes. Thank you. So, I guess, just following up on Katy's question, I just wanted to get your take on the broader demand environment. Are you specifically seeing more spending on on-premise infrastructure and renewed investments?","I know you've talked a lot about getting a lot of share and displacing customers, but you think you're getting an extra lift just an overall improving demand environment, probably for 2017 and then into 2018? Interested in your thoughts. Thanks.","George Kurian","I mean, I think, we operate in a broad range of geographies, so I'd be hesitant to give you an answer on one thing. I think the overall IT landscape that we see reflects the geographic economic outlook, right?","So in a country, where things are looking bullish, people are spending more. In countries where the economic landscape isn't as strong, people are not spending as much. I think that's the general pattern we see.","I think with regard to the U.S., I think clearly, the economic outlook is a little better. That's giving people more confidence and you're seeing that. I think with regards to our own product portfolio, we are overweight relative to everybody else in our industry of scale in the places where customers are spending.","So we have all-flash, converged, hyperconverged, and cloud as big bets, and they are clearly in the areas where customers are spending. And we have a differentiated portfolio in each of those segments. So we get to see a lot of transactions that are high priority for customers to spend. I don't think that's the case for other players in the market or broadly speaking, for the portfolio at large.","Kris Newton","All right. Thank you, Edward. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Simon Leopold","Great. Just wanted to see if we could drill down on - specifically on one of the geographies. EMEA look like it had some pretty decent sequential and I imagine some of that is seasonality. But some of our checks are indicating enterprise spending has improved in that region.","Just want to see if maybe you can elaborate a little bit on the trends of that particular market in the quarter in your outlook? Thank you.","George Kurian","We had good execution in a number of countries in EMEA. Certainly, Germany, improvements in Southern Europe, and stabilization in the UK. The UK market, I would say, is still trying to figure out the implications of Brexit. There's a lot of contingency planning. And so that does hold up certain large transactions.","We're winning our share of the smaller transactions. But I think we were very pleased with the strength of many, many parts of the European segment for us.","Simon Leopold","And your thoughts on the coming year?","George Kurian","I think it will still broadly reflect economic performance in those geographies. I would hesitate to characterize a single European outlook. I do think we feel good about our position in Germany, both because of the economy and as well as the strength of our local execution. We are by far the market share leader in Germany. I think we continue to see opportunities for further improvement in France and certain parts of Southern Europe.","And then in the U.K., we're waiting for further clarity on exactly how whether it's going to be a hard Brexit and how and when, right? So we'll tell you more at Analyst Day as that data gets clearer to us. Today, it'd be premature to comment about the U.K.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Simon. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Your line is open.","Nehal Chokshi","Yes, thanks for taking the question. Excellent quarter in my opinion. For the fiscal second quarter, was there an FX tailwind on product revenue, similar to what you saw for the January quarter?","George Kurian","Yeah. There was a little bit of help. I think it was about a one point help last quarter.","Nehal Chokshi","Okay. So that's fair to say that on a constant currency basis, product revenue did indeed accelerate?","George Kurian","Yes. That's correct.","Nehal Chokshi","Okay. Great. And if I may, a follow-up question. What percent of conversations are now being led with hybrid cloud? And what percent of close still some element of hybrid cloud in it?","George Kurian","I think it's certainly expanded substantially. I think most of our discussions with customers start with some flavor of cloud, whether it's a public cloud or service provider cloud, there's clearly an element of cloud in virtually every discussion.","I think with regard to the transactions themselves, they may start on-premises, but because of our road map to the cloud, right. So we think that these conversations are materially different than a year ago, and we're certainly benefiting from that.","Nehal Chokshi","Great. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Nehal. And I'll pass it back to George now for some closing remarks.","George Kurian","Thanks, Kris. Q3 marked another great quarter for NetApp. We are winning in the cloud and on-premises deployments as well as gaining new customers because of our Data Fabric strategy. We are gaining share in the high growth, all-flash array market, the SAN market and the converged infrastructure market. We're gaining momentum in the HCI market, and we are uniquely positioned to monetize the growth of the cloud. We feel very good about our position in the market and we're going to double down on it. Our continued strength drives my confidence in our future.","Thank you. And we hope to see you in April at our Financial Analyst Day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Kris, you may begin.","Kris Newton","Hello, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are our CEO, Tom Georgens; and our CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com, along with the earnings release, our financial tables and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. Financial information previously found in the supplemental commentary document will now be included in the accompanying supplemental data tables of the quarterly financial press release. Additionally, a historical supplemental data table providing historical multi-period financial information will be available on our website.","As a reminder, during today's call we will make forward-looking statements with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, all of which involve risks and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We describe some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on an 8-K. A detailed discussion of these reasons is included in our risk factors in our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Q reports, also on file with the SEC and available on our website, all of which are incorporated by reference in today's discussion.","All numbers discussed today are GAAP unless stated otherwise. To see the reconciling items between the non-GAAP and GAAP, you may refer to the table in our press release or on our website. In a moment, Nick will walk you through some additional color on our financial results and then Tom will walk you through his perspective on the business this quarter.","I'll now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Q1 was another quarter of consistent execution and solid financial performance. Revenue of $1.52 billion was up 5% year-over-year and roughly at the midpoint of our guidance range despite some sequential FX headwinds and a continued uncertain macro environment.","As we anticipated, year-over-year branded revenue growth was very strong, partially offset by further reductions in OEM revenue. Branded revenue was $1.35 billion, up 9% year-over-year, representing the largest increase in branded business in 7 quarters. OEM revenue continued to decline, down 20% on a year-over-year basis. Consistent with our expectations, we anticipate that OEM revenue will continue to decline on a year-over-year basis in Q2 and then normalize to the level we expected when we acquired Engenio.","Indirect revenues remained strong, with 80% of Q1 revenue coming through the channels and OEMs. Arrow and Avnet contributed 21% and 16% of our total revenue, respectively. From a geographic perspective, Americas grew 7%, EMEA grew 2% and Asia Pacific grew 3% on a year-over-year basis. Within the Americas, commercial was up almost 8% and public sector was up 5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin of 61.3% was in line with Q4 and consistent with our Q1 and full year expectations. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 53.3% was up almost 2 points and service gross margin of 59.5% was relatively flat year-over-year.","As we discussed on our call at the end of May, early in Q1, we took action to better align our investments and resources to our biggest opportunities, resulting in a headcount reduction of approximately 7% from our Q4 exit and a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $48 million. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 14.9%, over 2 points better than last year and up 1 point from our previous guidance, reflecting the benefits from our realignment activities net of new strategic investments across the business.","Non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 grew 26% year-over-year. We derived $0.01 of benefit from our slightly lower-than-anticipated tax rate of 16.6% and $0.01 from our Q1 share repurchase activities. Excluding this net $0.02 benefit, non-GAAP EPS came in $0.01 above the high end of our previous guidance range.","Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.1 billion in cash and investments. Days sales outstanding of 32 and inventory at 20 turns reflect seasonal improvement and strong operational performance. Deferred revenue decreased from Q4 by $68 million to approximately $2.9 billion. However, on a year-over-year basis, deferred revenue was up $174 million.","Cash from operations was approximately $286 million, an increase of 25% from Q1 of last year and free cash flow was 14.5% of revenue. Q1 is seasonally slow with respect to cash flows as cash generation is offset by payments of Q4 commissions and prior-year annual incentive compensation.","On our call last quarter, we outlined important enhancements to our capital allocation strategy, including a $3 billion share repurchase program over 3 years and the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. These actions not only demonstrate our confidence in the underlying long-term strength of NetApp's business, but also our commitment to generating value for our shareholders.","Consistent with our expectations, we returned just over $900 million to shareholders in Q1, which included approximately $850 million in share repurchases as well as approximately $51 million in our first cash dividend. We remain on track to achieve $1 billion in share repurchases by this September and today, we have also announced our next cash dividend of $0.15 per share of the company's stock to be paid on October 25.","As expected, we retired our convertible notes in June with $1.265 billion of U.S. cash payments and the issuance of just under 1 million shares of common stock related to the excess of the average share price over the conversion price of $31.85, net of note hedges. Q1 diluted share count decreased by approximately 8 million shares from Q4, primarily related to stock repurchases as well as option and RSU activities. Separately, the warrants associated with our now retired convertible notes will become exercisable in September and October and will create dilution if our share price is over $41.12 during this time frame. Our warrants are not hedged.","Turning to guidance. Our target revenue range for Q2 is $1.56 billion to $1.66 billion which, at the midpoint, implies about a 6% sequential growth and about 5% year-over-year growth. We expect year-over-year branded revenue growth at similar levels to Q1, implying a better-than-normal seasonal growth rate but a continued decline in OEM revenue. We expect consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 61% and non-GAAP operating margins of 16% to 16.5%, increasing over 1 point sequentially and up to 2 points over Q2 last year.","We expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at Q1 levels and then increase in the back half of the fiscal year. Based on our average stock price of $41.56 for the first 10 days of the quarter, we expect our diluted share count for Q2 to decrease to approximately 351 million shares. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q2 to range from approximately $0.60 to $0.65 per share, up 18% to 27% from Q2 last year. The midpoint of our EPS range implies mid-teens growth in EPS from operations alone versus Q2 of last year.","As we move into the second quarter, our expectations for fiscal 2014 remain unchanged. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix and growth, we are reiterating our expectation for approximately 61% gross margin and approximately 17% operating margin for the year. We continue to expect full year EPS growth in the mid-teens from operations and further supplemented by our capital allocation activities. We are on track to complete our plan of repurchasing $2 billion of stock in the 12-month period following our Q4 announcement, $1 billion of which will be completed by this September. Our cash-generating capacity remains intact and strong.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Tom for his thoughts. Tom?","Thomas Georgens","Thanks, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased that despite the macro uncertainties and constrained IT spending environment, the NetApp team delivered solid Q1 results. As Nick described, revenue came in near the midpoint of our guidance and EPS was over the top of the range. Gross margin improved from Q1 a year ago and was in line with our guidance. Most notably, we delivered strong branded revenue growth of 9% year-over-year. This strong growth builds on the momentum that we saw in the second half of fiscal year '13 and, as Nick noted, we expect a similar level of branded growth again in Q2.","The strength of our branded business reflects a tremendous value we are delivering to our customers today and their confidence in our long-term strategy to help them navigate the future. Data ONTAP, the #1 market share storage operating system, enables enterprise-wide scalable data management and consistency of operations across private, public and hybrid clouds. In Q1, we introduced Data ONTAP 8.2, building on the strong ONTAP foundation.","ONTAP 8.2 improves quality of service and nondisruptive operations and includes enhanced migration tools. At the core of ONTAP are storage virtual machines that support customers' software-defined initiatives by enabling them to partition shared resources securely and with quality of service across the cluster and automate provisioning to individual applications. Data ONTAP 8.2 has had the fastest adoption rate of any of our major releases and, overall, almost 60% of our entire installed base has moved to ONTAP 8.","Clustered ONTAP also continues to see strong customer interest and sales momentum. Clustered nodes are up more than 400% from Q1 a year ago. In Q1, clustered ONTAP revenue again reached the highest ever percentage of total revenue. The majority of clustered ONTAP systems are going to customers new to NetApp or new applications within existing customers. In either case, we are expanding our addressable market and solidifying our position in an increasing number of accounts.","We also saw strong momentum with our flash solutions. NetApp offers the broadest and most complete flash portfolio in the industry. Over 60% of FAS systems are shipped with Flash Cache and\/or Flash Pool. Flash Pool sales increased almost 50% from Q1 last year. Flash Accel, which began shipping this quarter, will combine application integration and enterprise data management with the performance capabilities of flash to finally enable the full potential of server-side flash.","On the all-flash array front, we have now shipped over 300 units of our recently announced EF540. The majority of EF540 units are in database acceleration deployments. Overall, in less than a year, NetApp has moved from the perception of not participating in the flash market to a leadership position.","In addition to the strong growth of the all-flash EF540, we are seeing accelerating growth of the total E-Series family. The technology agenda for E-Series is now driven by our branded solutions. We have an unambiguous position that clustered ONTAP is the premier solution for shared infrastructure and business applications. But there is also a set of workloads with a different set of requirements around performance, density and capacity that are driving extremely large data sets, which is where E-Series fits in.","The breadth of workload and customers for our branded E-Series solutions continues to expand and we are pleased with the progress we are now seeing in this product line. We expect that in aggregate, E-Series, both branded and OEM combined, will be a growing business in fiscal year '15.","This quarter, every FAS platform showed year-over-year growth in both units and dollars. Of particular note was the FAS6000 family, units of which grew 28% from Q1 a year ago. Additionally, we saw capacity shipments grow 16% year-over-year.","Our business model includes a strong partner ecosystem that drives customer success. Through our alliance partners and our reselling channel partners, we are delivering a complete innovation stack based on best-of-breed technology to our customers. A key proof point of this model is FlexPod, the industry's #1 converged infrastructure solution. FlexPod systems sold increased 30% year-over-year and the number of new FlexPod customers is up 22% from Q1 a year ago. NetApp and Cisco have expanded the program with FlexPod Select based on the E-Series architecture for dedicated high-performance workloads such as big data, high-performance computing and video analytics.","We further enhanced our partnership with Citrix through the integration of clustered Data ONTAP with Citrix for desktop and application virtualization, mobile collaboration and cloud services. We were pleased to be named Microsoft's Server Platform Partner of the Year for our innovative storage solutions that enable nondisruptive operation and deliver optimal operational efficiency for virtualized environments and cloud services. In addition, we expanded our alliance partnership with Microsoft to accelerate the adoption of enterprise cloud systems.","I said earlier that our strong branded revenue growth stems from the value we are delivering to customers today and their confidence in our ability to help them navigate the future. Let me elaborate.","We are leading in technology across the big trends that are shaping the industry today: mobility, big data, flash, software-defined and cloud. In Q1, we introduced NetApp Connect, which delivers mobile access to corporate data while maintaining the tight security and control that enterprise IT requires by keeping its data and business protected. With our ability to unify structured and unstructured data into a single infrastructure, we are unmatched in our ability to manage the breadth of enterprise data at scale. Our breadth and adoption rate of flash technology has been a big contributor to our recent performance and our cloud and software-defined strategies are unique in the industry.","As CIOs look to optimize business outcomes for their enterprises, there are more options available than ever before. Emerging storage technologies such as flash and deployment models like converged infrastructures are impacting on-premise computing. NetApp has leadership positions in both. In addition, customers have alternate off-premise IT delivered models available to them as well. Enterprise customers will deploy some hybrid combination of all of these models. However, regardless of the ultimate computing destination, the CIO will maintain responsibility for data stewardship.","The introduction of the cloud makes data governance even more complex because data is distributed and not under direct control. NetApp's vision is to create an enterprise data management solution that will span the customer's data storage landscape regardless of data type or location. We have our integrated FAS storage systems. With V-Series, we can manage other vendor storage devices. With Flash Accel, we can manage flash in the servers. ONTAP in a virtual machine and NetApp Private Storage for Amazon Web Services are technologies that enable management of data in the cloud. We believe that these capabilities and the future options that they create uniquely enable NetApp to deliver the vision of a unified multi-platform distributed enterprise data management solution. This is the epitome of software-defined and a more expansive vision than we've seen presented by anyone to date. More importantly, much of it is available now, enabling customers to choose NetApp today with the confidence in our ability to meet their future requirements.","When I look at the evolution of clustered Data ONTAP, our broad flash portfolio, the growth of our E-Series branded solutions and the work we are doing around NetApp Connect and NetApp Private Storage for Amazon Web Services and storage grid, I see that we have more technology at the early stages of its product life cycle today than at any time in our history. We believe we have more as yet unrealized potential out of this portfolio than ever before. Because of this, I remain confident in our ability to outgrow the market and gain share, not only today, but tomorrow as well.","Finally, I would like to thank the more than 12,000 NetApp employees for maintaining focus in the face of an uncertain macro environment and our recent realignment to deliver a solid quarter. All of your hard work across all aspects of the business is coming to fruition and we are seeing that in our results.","At this point, I will open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Shelby Seyrafi (sic) [Shebly Seyrafi] with FBN Securities.","Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about the product gross margin? It was up year-to-year, but it declined about 200 basis points sequentially. My checks indicate there's competition from IBM and EMC. So if you can elaborate on that.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Sure, Shebly. Nick Noviello here. So let me just reiterate the numbers that you're referring to. So product gross margin in the fourth quarter was 55.8% and in the first quarter was at 53.3%. Frankly, we typically see a decline in product gross margin in the business. The other thing that you need to keep in mind as you look at the sequential and what happens on the seasonality here is that you're going to end up with a mix of business that's a little different because the branded business is going to be the one that is sequentially down. And what you see on a sequential basis is that the OEM side of the fence was relatively unchanged, so there's going to be a mix impact as well. So we really have to look at a combination of mix of business, right, branded versus OEM. We look at the seasonal that happens anyway from Q4 to Q1 and we look at a variety of other components here. There is nothing that I would say that's abnormal in discounting or competitive that's showing up in these numbers. They're all pretty consistent.","Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Nick, if I can follow through. Do you expect the gross -- product gross margin to return to like high 55s, 55% to 56% by the end of the year or over the next 1.5 years?","Nicholas R. Noviello","So what I would say there, first of all, so we gave you the guidance for Q2, Q2 guidance, approximately 61% on gross margin. Again, if you look at the seasonal over time, we generally have a higher gross margin on the product side in the second quarter. I would expect that to come through again. So we would see an increase in product gross margin there and, over time, we expect an increasing product gross margin.","Operator","Our next question is Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Tom, last quarter, you had talked pretty candidly about what you were seeing in terms of bookings, in particular, branded bookings. I think you had said double-digit growth year-over-year. Can you update us on what you saw in the July quarter from that perspective and then just kind of dovetailing that with linearity in the quarter?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think we stay away from bookings. It's not a -- we need to be careful of the definition there and it's not an auditable number. So we don't disclose bookings for the company. But I think as the quarter plays out, 9% branded growth is pretty strong. The fact that we're forecasting 9% or so branded growth again next quarter would indicate that we clearly have ongoing momentum in that area. So it certainly wasn't a one-off thing. And we see it across the board. Clearly, the clustered ONTAP uptake is key here. I think that the flash story, the all-flash array around the E-Series has been very, very powerful. I think we're very, very pleased with the momentum that we see there. So as far as I look at it, I think -- if I just took actually a bigger step back, I'd say the first half of last year, we were in a pretty big product transition around clustered ONTAP and we certainly saw the growth rate. And then we saw momentum build and market share gain in the second half of the year. I think we finished strong and I think we started this year relatively strong in this market. So I should think that we built some momentum last year. We talked about it in Q4. And I think it continues and it's reflected in our forecast for our branded business next quarter.","Operator","Our next question is Kulbinder Garcha with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The question is for Tom. Tom, with the pickup in revenue growth you're seeing last quarter, this quarter and what you're guiding for in the branded business, I'm kind of curious as to what you think is happening to the end market storage and your market share, just in terms of you're obviously probably gaining and probably gaining again in the mid end as well. Can you speak about some of the competitive dynamics? And are you getting any signs that with this pickup in revenue growth, that just the end market environment at least for the storage segment, it seems to be proving not only resilient, but maybe reaccelerating as you head into the second half of the calendar year?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think we can -- we need to focus on what we see and where we're winning. If I look at 9% branded growth, that's really the component that drives the market share number. I don't see anybody close to that number. So I think unquestionably, this is a pretty strong market share quarter for us, I think that goes without saying. I want to be careful about the industry at large. If I look at recent announcements, EMC storage business, a bit over 3.5%. I think Hitachi reported 1%. IBM was down and we'll see what HP and Dell report. But overall, I think that unquestionably, the demand for the products in our suite is clearly stronger than it certainly was a year ago. So I think we feel better about it. But I wouldn't go so far as to say that we've got an economic tailwind driving us. I think NetApp, the competitive position is stronger than it's been and I think we're making the most of it. So I think unquestionably, we're gaining share. That said, certainly, we saw a little bit better economic news in terms of GDP growth out of the EU reported this morning. And I think things probably feel a little bit better than they were a year ago, but I wouldn't use the word dramatic turnaround or anything like that. And certainly, as we think about our guidance, on the federal side, that's an important part of our business, we have the sequester component that's out there. I think we've had the sequester all year and NetApp has done very, very well there. I expect that to continue up until the end of the government fiscal year. But our quarter also includes October, which is the first month of the next fiscal year. And I think there's a little bit of concern about what it's actually going to play out there. So I'm not worried about anything NetApp specific on that front, but clearly, that's going to be a politicized process. But between now and the end of the government fiscal year, I expect us to continue to take our own fair share of the government business.","Operator","Next question is Kathryn Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I think somebody asked about linearity, but I'm not sure you specifically commented. Did you see an improvement in demand or just uptake in NetApp products as you move through the months of the quarter? And Nick, maybe you can comment on why DSOs came down so much and whether that speaks to linearity in the quarter.","Thomas Georgens","I would say that in general, the quarter was pretty typical. We also had kind of a NetApp-induced wrinkle this quarter is that we were doing the realignment and the restructuring this quarter. And clearly, that had the potential of having a big impact on our sales organization. We've certainly seen that to be disruptive to companies in the past and I think we've managed through that. But I think that, that probably had some impact on the timing. So I think there's probably a little bit of an anomaly. But I wouldn't say that we were any more back-end loaded or any more back-end coasting in than any quarters in the past. So I think it kind of played out the way we would've thought, but we did have a little bit of disruption in the middle as we, basically, realigned territories and reassigned quotas and did all things associated with the restructuring.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes. And Katy, just in terms of the DSO, yes, it was 37 in Q1 last year and down to 32, but we think -- we've seen 32 before. And I actually think there's a little bit here around all of the integration activities around Engenio are completely behind us. You see inventory turns up as well. I think there's a normalization there of that type of integration behind us. And then just strong execution across the board. And we're really pushing on that execution, I think, as that came through.","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I mean, the one thing I'd add on the execution front, this will be a message to employees tomorrow, is the DSO number was one of the best we've ever reported. The inventory turns number was one of the best we've ever reported, certainly the best since the Engenio acquisition. Gross margin is strong. We had the realignment and all of that. We didn't lose any sales momentum, at least not in the aggregate for the quarter. We also moved a factory in Europe last quarter without disruption to the business. So I think we've clearly upped the intensity around execution. And I think that all in all, we're pretty pleased about how this quarter came down.","Operator","Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on gross margins. Could you maybe talk about why do you guys see gross margins being flat in the October quarter guide, given the fact that sales are actually going to go up sequentially by about 6%? I imagine that mix will actually get more favorable as branded continues to grow for you. So maybe somewhat, what are the headwinds that I might be missing that are limiting gross margin uptick in the quarter?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes, so Amit, this is Nick. So let me walk through a couple of pieces. So I indicated that we would have -- we talked about the branded growth and that the branded mix will improve a little bit in the second quarter from the first quarter. Obviously, with that, that carries a higher margin base. The product gross margin, as I indicated to Shebly earlier, I would expect to go up from Q1 to Q2 or a sequential increase there. However, on the service side of the fence, the first quarter of the year is generally a higher or a high-water mark for the service side. Because a lot of the bookings come through in actual revenue in Q1, yet the costs are linear across the period of time. So in terms of services investments, I think you'll see and we will experience more services investments in the second quarter. That will impact the service gross margin and take that down. The blend is the approximate 61% we guided you to.","Operator","Our next question is from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo.","Maynard Joseph Um - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to touch a little bit more about the competitive landscape. I mean, it clearly sounds like you're still seeing good wins across the board. But I'm wondering if you've seen any changes within the competitive landscape, whether from the traditional vendors, the channel, or whether you're seeing more and more of the new entrants. Regardless of whether or not they're winning and you're winning the business, I'm just wondering if you've seen any changes in that competitive landscape.","Thomas Georgens","I'd say not a lot. Clearly, if I look at our portfolio with clustered ONTAP being mainstreamed and the flash momentum, I think we're probably better armed than we were a year ago and certainly more confident than we were a year ago. But I think the dynamics clearly are the independent players continuing to gain share, continuing to be more relevant and the service -- and the servers vendors continuing to decline in relevance. So I think clearly, whether we're competing though for the footprint of a server vendor or legacy server vendor installed base, we're typically competing with EMC to get that, whether EMC is the incumbent or not. So clearly, that's where the competitive intensity is the greatest and really across the board. Perhaps a little bit more with EMC, certainly, what we come out then with the value proposition of clustered ONTAP. We typically, EMC, go down the Isilon path or the V-Max path to try and match up a little bit differently rather than try to take us out with some of their traditional offerings. So I'd say that if there's one dynamic is we're probably seeing a lot more V-Max engagement. And I think that's really the clustered ONTAP lining up against VNX and EMC will go to V-Max instead to compete. That's probably the only thing that I see different. I mean, you certainly see small guys. But at the end of the day, the competitive intensity with EMC is in a large percentage of the transactions that we see.","Operator","Our next question is Ben Reitzes with Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Tom, when I look at your results -- and I'm hopping between some conference calls tonight, but it looks like the big difference is APAC maybe versus the Street. I was wondering, you might have -- you probably touched on it in your remarks, but if you could just talk a little bit there, if the U.S. looks actually pretty strong versus expectations, Europe in line and it looked like APAC was light. So obviously, that economy is pretty weak, but how do you see that playing out and when can that rebound? Because we've -- looking at this, it looks like you probably beat everybody's expectations in the U.S.","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I'd say probably one wrinkle in that story a little bit is that the thing that we look for in terms of our measurements, really, is bookings. And here's the case where the bookings performance and the revenue performance are a little bit distorted. So our bookings performance in APAC was actually a bit different. If I look at APAC, areas where we saw strength this quarter is Japan has been strong for us for several years now. That's really been a very, very strong management leadership story by the NetApp leadership over there. China had a very, very strong booking quarter, in the vicinity of just under 40%. But we also saw some weakness on the Australia side at the ANZ area. So I'd say it's somewhat uneven. Japan and China and then Korea is much, much smaller but has pretty good growth. But I'd say that ANZ, the Asian [ph] area and India are not as strong. But overall, I'd say from a booking perspective, the numbers are a little bit better than shipments. That's primarily a timing issue. So clearly, it's not at the growth rate we were probably 6 months ago. That's a fact, but still pretty good. And it's, from a booking perspective, higher than all the other areas.","Operator","Our next question is from Rajesh Ghai with Craig-Hallum.","Rajesh Ghai - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Tom, you mentioned that the Cluster-Mode was getting you into new workloads. And also, you're effectively competing against V-Max more than you had done in the past. I was wondering if you could talk about what those incremental workloads were and what -- how much of an incremental time are you addressing as a result of the Cluster-Mode now?","Thomas Georgens","Well, when I look at clustered ONTAP and the ability to take the feature set of Data ONTAP, which is the #1 operating system in the world from a storage perspective, and basically marry that with cluster and we can deliver really unlimited scale, unlimited performance and nondisruptive operation. So in our core markets, large-scale file services and content, clearly that's been a big market for us and this will allow us to scale even bigger. Virtualization, clearly a big play. We've established a big footprint. This will allow us more mission-critical nondisruptive operation, allow the virtualization of more applications that I think serves us well in our partnership with VMware and also expands our segment there. And I think that's pretty well understood. That, I think, is competitive as an existing segment. The other thing is going deeper in the data center, perhaps with some applications that might not have considered NetApp in the past. Database would certainly fall into that. Decision-support applications, things of that nature. And that's a big part of the business. Deeper in the data center, more mission-critical apps, now with the nondisruptive operation, the scale and the performance, they can offer a solution that can scale and perform better than any individual box from anybody and that's a TAM expansion component for us. And frankly, it's one of the biggest untapped, proven profit pools in the entire industry. So from our perspective, file services, virtualization, that's stronger where we previously played. But here's the opportunity to go deeper after more mission-critical applications in the data center, proven profit pool, and I'd say that's a big opportunity for us in terms of TAM expansion. And for clustered ONTAP, it's specific. That's probably the biggest TAM expansion opportunity we have.","Operator","Our next question is Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Tom, I wanted to ask about pent-up demand for 8.2 and 8.3. We talked about that in the channel. And then at the same time, if you could address the migration to clustered ONTAP, how difficult is it, what role does the channel play? Do you have services in-house now that are -- that makes that process a little easier?","Thomas Georgens","Well, we've just introduced 8.2. And one of the things about the clustered ONTAP story for us, one of the things as we compete with this technology and move into the new technology, requires the migration of the data. And that takes time, it requires scheduling and a bunch of other things. So one of the things that we have with 8.1 is -- and we've talked about it in the past, is it doesn't have 100% feature compatibility with the 7 mode before it. So for some customers, before they migrate, they want to make sure their business processes can transfer seamlessly to the new software. So interesting is for all the momentum that we've seen up until the release of 8.2, it's primarily not come from merely repositioning our existing product base or existing customer base. But it's actually come from brand-new accounts and brand-new workloads, which actually have the team pretty excited because that basically says that the value proposition is strong because we can beat the competition with it. But the real migration of our existing footprint, that has really only just begun. So with 8.2, we closed a substantial amount of the feature gaps where a substantial amount of our installed base can now move seamlessly to the new platform, but they physically have to migrate the data in order to do it. And with 8.2 comes a set of migration tools that will help them with that process. So -- and kind of my internal joke is that, so far, that it's proven to be easy to compete against the competition with clustered ONTAP than it is to compete against ourselves. But now with the feature parity mostly achieved, the opportunity to move more and more customers. And that's probably going to be a big part of our activity over the 6 months. But that's not just the pent-up demand. That doesn't happen overnight. It takes finite time to move. It's something that needs to be scheduled. It's something that the customers need to plan. But I expect it to be a relatively significant activity over the rest of this fiscal year now that we've got 8.2 out. So my summary is that most of what we've done so far, despite all the growth with thousands of machines and everything and all the progress that we've made, that's really been the hard growth of basically new wins and new workloads. And just the conversion of the existing installed base, I'd say that we're in the early days of that.","Operator","Our next question is Steve Milunovich with UBS.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You gave some numbers on the series 6000. Can you give similar numbers on the 2000 and the 3000? And also, do you contemplate much impact from the VNX upgrade that's likely to come in the market over the next 2 quarters?","Thomas Georgens","Well, while they're looking up the other numbers, I'd say one of the things that was notable is that all platforms, 2000, 3000 and 6000, were all up year-over-year. It's been a long time since I've said that. So that's all pretty good. 6000 is particularly strong. In terms of VNX, I think at the end of the day, platform refreshes don't fundamentally change the competitive basis. I mean, that's kind of an arms race. Customers see that going on. Unless you're basically creating a new architecture, entering a new space, I'm not quite sure that that's a game changer. The real decision point to choose NetApp regardless of the platform that they run on is really the software value proposition. And as I see EMC with VNX today faced with the clustered ONTAP value proposition, I see them move a lot more towards Isilon and V-Max and not take those 2 products head-to-head. So I guess from my take is unless we see a significant expansion of the software portfolio associated with VNX, I really don't expect it to change the competitive landscape that much. Okay. On the units. Okay. I got a -- let me see what I can read off to you. So in terms of units, 6000 was 1,471. 3000 was 4,743. 2000 was 10,040. Revenue for the 6...","Nicholas R. Noviello","That's it.","Thomas Georgens","That's it. I guess that's enough. But basically up on revenue -- I'd say pretty much up on revenue, up on units by roughly the same percentage.","Operator","Our next question is Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to follow up, if I could, on the total deferred revenue. It's only declined sequentially a couple times in the past 4 years. Just kind of curious if there are any sort of puts and takes we should walk away with related to that quarterly change here. Was there any change in relation to bookings conversion rates or just in terms of the quality of the revenue mix? Kind of curious what are the dynamics there if there were.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Sure. Mark, it's Nick. So let me walk you through that. So we had a decline in deferred revenue in Q4 of last -- sorry, Q1 of last year as well when we went from Q4 into Q1. So this has happened before. And I think what you really need to look at is the decline and the sequential decline from Q4 to Q1 in branded business because that's where we have a deferred revenue component, right? So when we look at the OEM, by the way, there's virtually no deferred component, if any. So this is really all about the sequential reduction in branded revenue from quarter-to-quarter. And when you have a sequential reduction of the sizes we're talking about, there's going to be an impact on deferred revenue as well. And deferred revenue is simply you can think about it as thousands and thousands of contracts that amortize over periods of time. That's a $3 billion balance on the balance sheet, right? And every quarter, we are adding new contracts to it and subtracting and amortizing off older contracts or recognizing revenue for older contracts. And it's really just a matter of what goes in versus what goes out. And when you have a sequential decline at the level you did this quarter from Q4 to Q1, which we expected, and you had a sequential decline from Q4 of FY '12 into Q1 of FY '13 like we did, you're going to have that reduction.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But it was still up year-over-year?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes, still up year-over-year. So I wouldn't get beyond -- too much beyond this is a timing thing and this is really what happens with that sequential type of decline in branded revenue.","Operator","Next question is from Louis Miscioscia with CLSA.","Louis R. Miscioscia - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Tom, you mentioned that things don't really change unless there's a big architectural shift on the normal refresh. So with a lot coming out in the flash area, what's your view about whether you think flash is going to change the industry, maybe not over the next couple of months, but maybe over the next couple of years? Obviously, main cost might be more. But then again, when we take space, power cooling efficiency and it does get pretty attractive and for you all to really have to wait until your flash raise [ph] out before you could start pushing harder?","Thomas Georgens","Frankly, we're pushing hard pretty now -- pretty hard now. And I think the EF540 story is we're quite pleased with that. With 300 machines in a relatively short period of time, I don't know how many people have shipped more than that, but it can't be many, if any. So I think we've been quite pleased with that momentum. I think that, certainly, the market will evolve over time. Where we are today, I think the unquestioned prove and use case is basically raw performance married with high availability. And I think that's really the strength of the EF540. It's got a long history of performance-based architecture and it's got a long history of proven high availability and I think that's really what's driving it. I think the use case for more rich functionality and persistent stores, I think that use case is still evolving. And I think that part of it is the maturity of the technology; part of it is, is the economics. When I take flash and kind of distill it down to its core premise is flash, on a capacity basis, is more expensive than disk. But from an I\/O per second, it's actually a lot less expensive than disk. So the task at hand abstracting any individual technology is how do you get the random I\/O workload on flash and how do you get everything else on raw drives. And that's really the essence of the problem here. So the data placement component of this matters a lot. So the argument -- and what that also means is that you can't afford to have idle data on flash. And frankly, I think the argument that flash is cheaper on the total cost of ownership basis than disk, particularly SATA disk, that argument doesn't wash. I don't see customers buying that. I don't see the trend favorable in that dimension either. So I think it's still going to be the case where flash is more expensive and, therefore, data placement is going to be critical. So as we think about the functionality of individual flash arrays and all the stuff that we're working on in FlashRay, I think that matters. But I also believe that managing the data placement across a multimedia storage hierarchy, some flash, some disk, some tape or some cloud, that, that problem has to get solved and that is just as important. And I think that's really where ONTAP gives us a key long-term advantage. So in addition to the FlashRay technology, being able to integrate that into a unified enterprise-wide data management framework like ONTAP, I think it's a really, really key advantage for us in the long run. So how do I see flash? I see flash as part of a data storage hierarchy. And the data placement, how the data resides on the most cost-effective, performance optimized component at any point in time, that is ultimately going to be the intellectual property that's going to drive this to be a mainstream technology.","Operator","Our next question is Brian Alexander with Raymond James.","Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Tom, back to the strength in clustered ONTAP, if you can give us an update on the installed base penetration that you have there in both the mid range and the high end? I think last quarter was around 18%. And where do you think that penetration can be in a year with 8.2 introduced out in the marketplace given the opportunity you mentioned before with your existing base?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think overall, what we saw in the quarter, obviously, with the Q4 to Q1 seasonality, we didn't see a sequential increase like we saw in the past. But as a percentage of total revenue, it's the highest it's ever been. We saw with the 6000s, it was probably roughly comparable to last quarter, a bit less than 30%. And what we did see this quarter is actually a pickup in connect rates with the 3000s. So that's probably saying that's a little bit different now. 2000 connect rates are a bit lower. Although with 8.2, there's some functionality that makes that more cost-effective and we expect to see some activity there. In terms of where does it want to go, that's kind of a tough call overall. Obviously, it will be a function of the rate at which customers in their own operations want to do the migration. Clearly, we see internally, at least in the 3000s and the 6000s, we want to see the tipping point of 50%. That's kind of the number that we're driving for. So I'm not going to disclose a time frame on that. But as far as we're concerned, that's the metric that we're driving is where do we get -- when do we get those to 50%. So that's clearly within our planning horizon and that's what we're driving for.","Operator","Our next question is Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Looking at the savings you've captured from the restructuring so far, can you remind us what portion of that's going to be reinvested in the business versus falling to the bottom line and the timing of that reinvestment throughout the fiscal year? And I guess if you could also remind us how -- where you're focusing that.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes, Bill, it's Nick. So we realized in the quarter a little over $20 million of savings from the realignment action that we did. And recall that, that realignment action was really about making sure that our investments were pointed at the biggest return, right? And what we indicated at the time that built into our approximate 17% operating margin and operating profit margin guidance for the year was not only the takeout of the set of costs, but the reinvestment of the set of costs across a number of initiatives, clustered Data ONTAP being one of them, flash being another. Those are the types of things that we're pointing those investments to. And we talked about the fact that, that would happen over the course of the year. In Q1, you're not going to see a lot of that. It's going to be slower in Q1 because you're still, in part, this process took most of the quarter to execute. A lot of it in the U.S., done pretty much immediately. Some of it, places around the world, it takes longer. So we are in the reinvestment mode. I'm going to ask if you all can still hear as well.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I can still hear you.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Okay. I'm getting feedback here on the phone. So we are in the reinvestment mode. That reinvestment is planned over the remaining quarters of the year. It's built into our guidance as we give guidance each quarter and it's built into our guidance for the full year of approximately 17% operating margin. Frankly, it is also a lever. And if we, over the course of the year, determine that for macro reasons or other reasons we're not going to see the type of profitability we expect, we'll pull that lever. But at this point in time, our view on the year is absolutely intact, our view on the quarter is intact and our view on the reinvestment is intact.","Thomas Georgens","Yes, the one thing I'd -- just to reiterate a little bit is on the last call, we talked about shareholder return and our commitment to driving high single digits EPS -- actually, mid single digits EPS growth over the course of the year and the fact that we now have multiple avenues to get there, right? We certainly got the -- we can basically have the reinvestment lever to get there. We can slow that down if revenue doesn't materialize. We can also -- we actually have the capital reallocation plan. So there's a bunch in play and then, obviously, the [indiscernible] growth of the business. So I want to be clear. We said we'd be at kind of mid-teens and we're committed to that. And I think that even in an uncertain environment, between the recap, the reinvestment and the operation in the business, I see the multiple avenues of getting there. And that's why we're in a position to reiterate that number for the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Maybe Tom and Nick, could you just give us, I guess, some sense of what goes into your buyback decisions, the pace of your buyback in the mosaic that you look at when you're kind of deciding? I guess going forward from this point, that you'll be looking at to balance out the pace of buyback decisions.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes, so Ananda, this is Nick. Let me start off with that one and, certainly, Tom will add his point of view as well. So when we talked about this 90 -- 120 days ago and change, we talked about what we're planning for a 3-year period of time and then what we're planning for the first 12 months of that and the first 90 days -- actually, 120 days. So we indicated in the first 4 months, we buy $1 billion back, right? That first 4 months is basically through September. What you see is that in our first quarter, we bought $850 million of stock back. We did an ASR of $750 million, that's behind us. We did $50 million otherwise, that's behind us. So we've done absolutely what we've said, actually probably a little faster than linear, in this first quarter. I would expect that over the remainder of Q2 and probably pushed towards the front end of Q2, we will finish that $1 billion of repurchase. You also see on the dividend side, we did the $51 million in dividend in Q1. We'll do the same towards the end of Q2. To your point on the rest [ph], right, we indicated that in a 12-month period of time, so basically up until May of next calendar year, we will purchase another $1 billion. We will absolutely do that and we'll -- we have at our disposal, really, the timing of that. But we're going to be aware of all of those pieces and look at the timing. I think for Q2, I would say that we're going to first be focused on this first $1 billion of the $3 billion program. We're going to be focused on getting the warrants behind us. That's a September, October maturity on the warrants. And then we're going to be absolutely looking at the second $1 billion of the $3 billion program which we talked about for a 12-month period of time. And that 12 months really runs through May of next calendar year.","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I think that's fair. And we'll give you visibility into what we're thinking there on the next call once we get through the September and October period.","Operator","Our next question is Glenn Hanus with Needham & Company.","Glenn Hanus - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So back on the E-Series and maybe you could give us some more color there. You're looking for that to stabilize or even grow in fiscal 2015, some color on application. You talked about a little bit, Tom, application, use cases there on the branded side. And then on the OEM side, will that stabilize somewhat? Or should that just continue to be a declining business for the foreseeable future?","Thomas Georgens","Well, on the OEM side, I think we got 1 more quarter at least of decline. And that's what we're expecting, just 1 more quarter of decline and then I think we'll start to see it stabilize from there. And we'll also see, hopefully, some of the new wins in that space start to contribute or at least offset the decline. So I think clearly, at the end of the day, we're kind of where we thought we would be when we bought this business in the first place. We kind of took a circuitous route to get here. But clearly, we've seen 20% declines the last couple of quarters. And eventually, when we come one full circle, that will start to normalize. And in fact this quarter, from a booking perspective, absent one OEM, the rest of the business was actually up slightly for the first time in quite a while. So that was positive for us. The thing that probably took a little bit longer to come to fruition, really, is the momentum around the branded side. We expected that to offset the decline of the -- the expected decline of the OEM by now and that was a little slow in developing. But we've really seen some good momentum. In fact, the branded side was actually up sequentially from Q4 slightly. And unlike the rest of the branded business, kind of flip that off. So we're quite pleased with that. The EF family is -- it's clearly an important part of that, the all-flash array. We talked about the units that we shipped. But I should add that, that is less than half of the total E-Series bookings. So we're seeing E-Series go out in many of the areas that we thought. We're seeing in large storage repositories in media, in health care, oil and gas, high-performance computing-type applications. So we're starting to see the aperture open wider on that and we're starting to see a much, much broader acceptance of the technology. Early on, a lot of that business was centralized in a couple of geos, particularly U.S. public sector and to some extent, in the media space. But now we're starting to see it more broadly across the entire footprint of our installed base. We actually see a fair amount of momentum in Europe this past quarter. We had a relatively large program underway. So I think, overall, I'd say we're probably behind where we expected to be at this point on the branded side. But the ramp has actually been pretty strong and we feel pretty good about it. And that's why I made the comment earlier that in the aggregate, I expect the combined branded plus OEM business, that should be a growth business for NetApp in fiscal year '15.","Operator","Our next question is Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Tom, I wanted to follow up from something earlier. You mentioned 8.2 might get into existing workloads. It's certainly consistent with what we've heard. It's been more about new workloads. Does that change your -- how should we be thinking about the mix impact from a customer perspective? Might customers migrate up, so to speak, in terms of their mix profile if 8.2 does get some adoption with existing workloads?","Thomas Georgens","Migrate up...","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Maybe move from the high end -- or excuse me, high end of 2000 series to the low end of 3000 series. In other words, the requirements of 8.2 suggest that customers might need a bit more horsepower, so to speak.","Thomas Georgens","There's certainly conflicting points of view on that. I think there's one conventional wisdom that says the high-end platforms are optimized for performance and the low-end platforms are optimized for cost and the mid range are optimized for price performance, so a balance. And therefore, with clustering technology, the best price performance alternative would be to actually cluster the mid-range products. And you have a debate as to whether we'll ever need another high-end platform again. And in my experience, not only here on this product but in other situations I've been, is that it doesn't always play out that way. It's that the early adopters are the ones that are most performance constraint and they're going to go to the biggest platforms and they're going to cluster those. And we've certainly seen that, at least in the early days. Perhaps now, with a little bit of tick up of clustered ONTAP connect rate on the 3000s, maybe we're starting to see that, that pieces play out a little bit. So I actually don't think that it will migrate to the larger platform. If anything, it might actually go the other way because you can build very, very, very large systems incrementally using more cost-effective building blocks. So and the net of it is, it's margin neutral to us. So in terms of modeling the business, I don't think it fundamentally changes anything. And that's part of the reason why we're somewhat -- we're not very, very emphatic about going one way or the other way. Whatever's best for the customer, I think serves our purpose, as well, and we're more than happy to accommodate that.","Operator","At this point, we will turn the call back to NetApp for final remark.","Thomas Georgens","Okay.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.","I would like to turn the call over to your host, Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kris Newton","Hello and thank you for joining us on our Q1 fiscal year 2015 earnings call. With me today are CEO, Tom Georgens; and our CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2015, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections.","Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We described some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on a Form 8-K. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2014, subsequent Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our current reports on Form 8-K also on file with the SEC and available on our website.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release and on our website.","In a moment, Nick will walk you through some additional color on our financial results, and then Tom will give his perspective on the business this quarter.","I'll now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Noviello","Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. NetApp executed well in Fiscal Q1. We achieved net revenues above the midpoint of our previous guidance range, evidenced that our strong portfolio solutions is well aligned with the evolving priorities of our customers and we delivered another quarter of strong operating results with non-GAAP gross margin, operating margin and EPS all above Q1 guidance ranges.","Net revenues of $1.49 billion were down 10%, sequentially, reflective of typical Q4 to Q1 seasonality but less than the sequential declines we have experienced over each of the last two years. Branded revenue of $1.36 billion was 91% of net revenues and was up 1% from Q1 FY '14. OEM revenue continued to decline on a year-over-year basis consistent with our expectations. OEM revenue of $129 million was down 23% versus Q1 last year.","Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs accounted for 79% of Q1 net revenues due to typical seasonality and an increase in large transactions fulfilled directly in Q1. Consistent with historical trends, Arrow and Avnet contributed 22% and 16% of net revenues, respectively. Geographic performance came in as expected.","Non-GAAP gross margin of 64.3% was just 10 basis points below Q4 and above our Q1 guidance range. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 57.1% was down almost a point sequentially on less favorable product mix but up almost four points year-over-year due to a combination of supply chain savings, favorable product mix and lower warranty costs. Service gross margin of 62.7% was consistent with Q4 and up more than three points year-over-year due to higher service revenues. ","Non-GAAP operating margin was 15.9%, almost a point above our previous guidance. We continue to invest in the business to deliver innovative data management solutions for the hybrid cloud while at the same time maintaining prudence around overall spending. Consistent with my comments on the last two earnings calls, effective this quarter, we implemented a change in how we report our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be more reflective of our operational results and tax structure.","As a result, we have excluded for Q1 and will exclude for future periods from our non-GAAP tax provision the impact of items such as income tax audit settlement and the temporary lapse of tax law, such as the federal R&D credit. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 16.5% in line with our expectation.","Q1 weighted average diluted share count of 329 million shares was below our prior guidance and decreased by approximately 7 million shares sequentially due to share repurchase activity in the quarter and the benefit from Q4 repurchases. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.60 exceeded the high end of our prior guidance range by $0.02 reflecting an approximate $0.01 benefit from lower share count resulting from Q1 repurchases and the combination of higher than projected revenue and strong gross margins.","Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.6 billion in cash and investments, 19% of which is onshore. The sequential increase in onshore cash was due predominately to our $500 million seven-year senior notes issued in June. Inventory turns were at 20 and days sales outstanding decreased sequentially to 36 on normal seasonality. Deferred revenue of $3.1 billion was seasonally down versus Q4, though less so than in each of the last two years. That said, deferred revenue was up $135 million from Q1 last year.","Q1 cash from operations was approximately $260 million versus $286 million in Q1 FY '14. Free cash flow was 11% of revenue in Q1 and was impacted by higher payment of annual incentive compensation and in audit settlements. The audit settlement had no impact to cash and cash equivalents as we utilized excess stock option benefits to offset taxes payable related to the audit.","In Q1 we returned over $172 million to shareholders which included $119 million in share repurchases and $53 million in cash dividends. We remain on track to complete the last $1 billion of our share buyback program by the end of May 2015 consistent with the guidance we provided last quarter. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.165 per share of the company stock to be paid on October 22, 2014.","Now turning to guidance. We are pleased with the momentum we see building in the business but remain conscious of market dynamic. Our target revenue range for fiscal Q2 is $1.49 billion to $1.59 billion which at the midpoint implies about 3% sequential growth and roughly flat revenue year-over-year. We expect continued branded revenue growth including a seasonal uptick related to the U.S. government\u2019s fiscal year ended September to be partially offset by continued declines in OEM revenue.","We expect non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 64% to 64.5% and non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 17.5% to 18%. Based on our repurchases in Q1 and in the first 10 days of Q2, we expect our diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 330 million shares. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q2 to range from approximately $0.66 to $0.71 per share.","Our expectations for fiscal 2015 remain unchanged at this time. We anticipate mid-single-digit branded revenue growth ramping over the course of the year and partially offset by declines in OEM revenue of up to 40% for the full year. So ultimately dependent on revenue mix and growth, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 63% to 64% and non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 18% for fiscal 2015.","We continue to expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be about 16.5% and full year non-GAAP EPS growth of just under 10%. Finally, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and, as I indicated earlier, remain on track to complete our existing share repurchase plan by the end of May 2015.","In closing, we are confident in our strategy of helping customers navigate the transformation of their IT deployment as they take advantage of new technologies like flash and new consumption models such as cloud. Our best-in-class portfolio is driving momentum in our branded business enabling us to invest in continued innovation while delivering shareholder value.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Tom for some additional color on the quarter. Tom?","Tom Georgens","Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased with the results the NetApp team delivered this quarter. The strength of our portfolio combined with a continued operational discipline enabled us to achieve revenue over the midpoint of our prior guidance with gross margin, operating margin and EPS above the top of our previous guidance ranges.","IT is in the midst of a significant transition. Enterprises are facing the profound challenge of adopting new technologies and delivery options while managing the reality of their current infrastructure and meeting the increasing demands of the business. Customers see the business value of these new options but also recognize that they cannot abandon or even freeze in place the mature proven and compliance solutions that run the business today.","CIOs need solutions that continue to enhance and optimize their current environment while simultaneously enabling the full potential of newer architectures and delivery models. NetApp\u2019s portfolio of data management solutions improves the economic flexibility and business impact of customers existing infrastructure while our cloud and technology vision gives them confidence in our ability to help them navigate the future.","This message is resonating and more large enterprises are placing big bets on NetApp. Consistent with the increase in enterprise buying activity we saw in Q4 fiscal '14, we also saw a significant increase in deals over $1 million in Q1 from the same quarter last year.","Cloud is the biggest disrupter to the industry. It can enable enterprises to optimize elements of their IT portfolio in ways that were never available before and provide flexibility and cost benefits for certain workloads. However, the economic benefits are not advantageous for all workloads. Likewise, there are noneconomic considerations like security, regulation and performance that also impact cloud decisions.","Our customers are telling us that they want a hybrid cloud. The deployment of internal and external resources combines in a way that is optimized to meet today\u2019s needs with the ability to evolve over time. Seamless data management is integral to the realization of this vision. Once data is created, it needs to be managed forever and therefore accumulates which makes subsequent movement both time consuming and bandwidth intensive.","This makes the requirements for storage different than that for servers and networking which are more fungible in nature. Only Data ONTAP, the industry\u2019s number one storage operating system, addresses these requirements through its rich software functionality that provides a seamless data management experience across internal and external cloud resources. Clustered ONTAP is unmatched in meeting the IT transformation requirements of both the enterprise and cloud service providers.","The rapid adoption of Clustered ONTAP continued in Q1 with shipments of Clustered nodes growing 177% from last year. The attach rate of Clustered ONTAP increased across all product lines. Both midrange and high-end platforms are approaching a 50% attach rate and the recently introduced Cluster optimized FAS8000 family is above 60%. The success of Clustered ONTAP is due to its ability to provide support for a broad range of workloads and improve operational capabilities while reducing the overall complexity of the storage infrastructure.","Clustered ONTAP enables customers to go incrementally and non-disruptively with the flexibility of a wide range of deployment options from conversion and integrated systems to third party arrays as well as software-only solutions. Customers also need a range of performance levels from this storage infrastructure. All data has a lifecycle over which its performance and economic value varies, which drives customer requirements for all flash, all disk and hybrid arrays.","However, regardless of the attributes of a specific data at any point in time, almost all data is ultimately hybrid over its lifecycle necessitating automated data management as a critical component to realize the full potential of flash technology. In fact, the majority of our midrange and high-end system shift in a hybrid configuration with the mix of flash and hard drives.","On our Q4 call, I talked about customer demand for all flash configurations of our FAS arrays. The ability to create all-flash nodes in a larger cluster with unified data management and transparent volume migration is a compelling capability not offered by alternative architectures.","In Q1 we built on this momentum and expanded on our flash portfolio by introducing all-flash FAS products to further address the need for ultimate performance while leveraging existing tools and processes. Shipments of all-flash arrays, our EF family and all-flash FAS products grew 48% and flash capacity shipped more than double from Q1 a year ago.","With the broadest portfolio of array-based flash solutions, NetApp is well positioned to help IT organizations optimize for a wide variety of performance, efficiency and scalability requirements. I am proud to say that just last week, our flash solutions were honored with two awards at the Flash Memory Summit for most innovative customer implementation and for the best all-flash NAS array.","In Q1, we refresh our entry in high-end FAS product lines with the introduction of the FAS2500 family and the FAS8080 EX. Year-on-year, our high-end and midrange FAS shipments grew 14% and 10%, respectively. Entry FAS systems were down 19% consistent with our expectations of the transition to the new FAS2500.","Branded E-Series systems, inclusive of the EF products, more than doubled from Q1 a year ago. FlexPod, our converged architecture solution, continues to perform well with shipments up 25% from last year.","Now let\u2019s come back to the big industry disruptor, the cloud. It is generally viewed as a threat to enterprise IT players but with our differentiated approach, we see it as an opportunity. Enterprises value our seamless data management as new cloud service providers who rely on our proven efficiency, seamless scalability and non-disruptive operations to support a responsive and profitable public cloud operation.","Of our top customers in Q1, roughly half are companies that offer cloud-based services and purchase NetApp for use in both their internal enterprise IT and external cloud offering. Where the customers are providers or consumers of cloud solutions, NetApp is uniquely positioned to add value.","In Q1 we announced the extension of NetApp private storage solutions to include Microsoft Azure and demonstrate our ability to interoperate between Azure and Amazon web services. Additionally, we deepened a hybrid cloud partnership with Equinix. The Equinix cloud exchange and dynamically connect NetApp private storage customers to multiple public clouds by maintaining full ownership and control of their data with NetApp private storage, yet being able to access multiple cloud compute resources through high bandwidth links, customers can realize a full flexibility of economic benefits of multi-cloud solutions without the risk and regulatory concerns associated with relinquishing data stewardship.","We serve a broad range of workloads with the ability to bridge the enterprise on premises architectures of today with the cloud architectures of the future. Clustered Data ONTAP is a data management framework to seamlessly enable enterprise hybrid cloud. E-Series provides us access to new workloads and customers and complements ONTAP as a dedicated, high performance SAN solution.","Spanning both ONTAP and E-Series environments are out FlexPod converged architecture and hybrid all-flash solutions. FlexPod helps customers by removing the risk and burden of integration, the speed of deployment of new technology. Our flash solutions fill our customer requirements for high performance storage including the displacement of legacy frame arrays. The set of workloads and architectures that we address today is unparallel in the company\u2019s 20-year history. With our portfolio of solutions, we are helping the world\u2019s largest enterprises transform their IT departments with a better way to manage their environments, deliver new capabilities to the business and achieve their vision for the hybrid cloud.","We are seeing momentum in our key investments areas; Clustered ONTAP, flash, cloud, branded E-Series and expect that momentum to accelerate over the course of fiscal year '15. We are confident in our continued ability to win with our best-in-class portfolio that addresses the most predominant customer needs, our track record of innovation and our enterprise relationships.","We are also confident that our strategy and financial performance will translate into shareholder returns. We will continue to drive operating leverage in our business model to support continued investment in innovation and future growth. I\u2019d like to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued dedication in helping our customers realize their goals while maintaining a high level of operational discipline.","At this point, we will open up the call for Q&A. As always, I ask you to be respectful of your peers on the call and limit yourself to one question, so we can address as many people as possible. Thank you. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Brian Marshall with ISI. Your line is open.","Brian Marshall - ISI","Great. Thanks, guys. Nice quarter. A question with respect to flash array. Could we get a quick update there on what we\u2019re expecting for back half of the year launch? It\u2019s been over a year since you\u2019ve made any material acquisitions. Was wondering is that reflective of your thought about just being sort of avoid of any innovation on the private company landscape within storage and you want to tackle more like flash array and build from the ground up going forward? Thanks.","Tom Georgens","Okay. Well, first two questions and as far as flash array is concerned, we\u2019ve been saying for quite some time that that\u2019s a this year product and we\u2019ll actually see customer shipments of that product in fact next month. So really no change from what we\u2019ve been saying all along and continued progress there. And in addition to flash array, obviously the EF momentum continues to be strong and we also did our all-flash FAS announcement last quarter. So in terms of flushing out of the total portfolio for the different used cases we see, I think we feel really good about the flash portfolio. And we think flash, as we said along, will live in many incarnations; in hybrid storage, as standalone devices and the compelling component of all-flash FAS. It\u2019s not even an all-flash FAS, it\u2019s an all-flash node in a broader cluster leveraging all the data management and the transparent volume migration that comes with it. Overall, to answer your flash question, flash array is on the way, as I said in used cases that is targeted at. I think we\u2019re still very, very excited about that. We\u2019re excited to get that in the market. Certainly, we\u2019ve had a lot of dialogue with customers. We\u2019ve had (indiscernible) customers\u2019 hands, but the total flash portfolio I think certainly has been a key component of our momentum. As far as the acquisition side, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into the situation. I think we\u2019re always looking for tuck-in acquisitions that are going to be meaningful to fill either gaps or opportunities in our product line and you should expect to see us continue to do that. As far as larger transactions are concerned, those are going to be entirely asynchronous, they\u2019re going to be functions of timing, availability, costs, execute ability. So I wouldn\u2019t basically single any fundamental transition or thought or planning around large transactions, but smaller transactions should be somewhat on a regular cadence. So you should expect to see us do that, so certainly no change in our posture on either of those fronts.","Brian Marshall - ISI","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Your line is open.","Lou Miscioscia - CLSA","Okay, great. Maybe if I could tie two questions together\u2026","Tom Georgens","I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.","Lou Miscioscia - CLSA","Okay. So when I look at the OEM revenue, I thought that that came in a little bit higher than expected and the branded, it came in a little bit lower. And I realized you reiterated your guidance for the full year for the branded hitting midpoint, let\u2019s say, 5% type of growth. If it doesn\u2019t hit that, would you consider trying to reduce some of your OpEx which is a bit higher than some of your competitors?","Nick Noviello","So, Lou, it\u2019s Nick. Let me start on that one, Tom may have some comments as well. So, the indication on OEM was it was going to be up to 40 \u2013 and the discussion on OEM was for the year. And as a business declines, it\u2019s going to be dynamic. We\u2019ve seen some and you all have seen some announcements with respect to N-Series that\u2019s going to be effective this quarter. So, as we decline through pieces calling a specific by quarter is going to be complicated and we\u2019re not going to do it. And we\u2019ve talked about an up to 40 for the year decline, I think we\u2019re still consistent with that and that\u2019s reflective in my comments. And the branded revenue growth, the discussion was mid-single-digit. You saw branded revenue growth and I think that accelerates over the course of the year, really consistent with our view at Financial Analyst Day consistent with what we said in the fourth quarter. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any net change here.","Tom Georgens","Yes, and we moved from a negative position last quarter into a growth position this quarter. So I think that that\u2019s the start. The margin, we expect to build over the \u2013 as the year progresses. As I think about the year and as it plays out in terms of where we\u2019re going to get continued growth, certainly it compares on the federal side of the house get a little bit easier in the second half of the year. And if I think about where we are today and things that are coming to market from where we are a year ago, whether it be clustered ONTAP in production, we had a very strong E-Series quarter, OnCommand Insight, our support portfolio, flash, we just refreshed all the platforms. We laid out our cloud strategy. So I see a number of stimulants to our business that were not available to us a year ago, even six months ago. As far as the broader question about operating expense, we\u2019re sized to our plan for this year. We\u2019re off to a good start. So certainly if there\u2019s a major reversal to that, we\u2019ll have to change our plans just like always. But I think we\u2019re on track and that\u2019s not top of mind right now. Right now it\u2019s making the investments necessary to continue to feel the growth and so in no way defensive about our OpEx spending at this point in time. We have a plan and we\u2019re executing to it. We haven\u2019t made any changes to it.","Lou Miscioscia - CLSA","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Brian White, please check your mute button. Your line is open.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Tom, I\u2019m wondering if you could just walk us around the world in terms of the trend you\u2019re seeing by geography? It looks like EMEA outperformed APAC and Americas, so maybe some color there. I guess, what are you seeing on emerging markets? Some companies are seeing weakening again, some are \u2013 just curious? Thanks.","Tom Georgens","Yes, I think in the geo breakdown there\u2019s a couple of elements, obviously includes some of our OEM business which distorts the number to some degree. And then also timing of revenue relative to bookings. I\u2019d say if you think about from a bookings perspective, which is a little bit more current, EMEA kind of carried us and actually did a really good job last year but I\u2019d say that the biggest thing that we saw last quarter that was different is we saw strength back in the enterprise. We saw larger big deals, particularly U.S. enterprise for a variety of factors but it\u2019s kind of felt like it\u2019s been improving for the last six months whether it\u2019s maturity of Clustered ONTAP and adoptions of technology or macro in nature, but I\u2019d say from where we stand today from six months ago, clearly the return on enterprise spending is probably the biggest notable change and we see that across the board. So in terms of activity levels, the U.S. both commercial and public sector were probably the stronger areas this quarter which is probably like last year. But around the world, EMEA is still \u2013 after a pretty good year I think they continued along at that pace but not quite as good as the U.S. in the public sector. Your question on emerging markets for one thing is we\u2019re not as penetrated equally invested in all of the emerging markets but the two where we made significant investments are clearly India, we have a big infrastructure. That has actually saw some momentum in the last six months, so we\u2019re actually pleased about the progress there. And China was also in the plus category for us. The other segments, Brazil and Russia, have other complexity to them, but those are not major contributors to NetApp at this point in time, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got any real relevant macro commentary there given our market share but China and India still are contributors to us. We\u2019re positive about that and probably the biggest difference we saw last quarter and the end of the prior quarter was probably a rebound in enterprise spending in the U.S.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So just wanted to ask you a question on Clustered ONTAP. It\u2019s ramping nicely and you\u2019re seeing a bigger attach rate across all of your platforms. I guess can you give us any insight on what improvements are coming with 8.3? And then based on the new features that customers are asking for, how much of an impact do you think it will have on your win rate against the competition?","Tom Georgens","Well, I think \u2013 I\u2019ll talk about 8.3 in a second, but I think overall the ramp of Clustered ONTAP has been pretty gratifying. I think in the early days of the ramp, it was primarily brand new to NetApp accounts moving into new workloads in existing accounts and now it\u2019s becoming clearly a lot more mainstream in our larger accounts and a predominant selling motion by our sales force. So I think the ramp has been quite good. A year ago we were talking about feature parity and why you getting 7-Mode and Clustered ONTAP and not having nearly that much of a conversation at this point in time. And on top of that, the transition tools that we\u2019re in the APAC to release are being widely deployed and helping customers make the transition from 7-Mode to Clustered ONTAP as well. So 8.3 has got things like Metrocluster. It\u2019s got a whole bunch of other performance enhancements. Metrocluster is a product that we use for higher availability and disaster recovery. It allows us to compete with recovery times that are basically superior to all of our competitors including the frame arrays that are something that we use to basically sell to enterprise accounts. So it\u2019s a clear differentiator for us and this will not necessarily be the Metrocluster of Clustered ONTAP. It will actually be a brand new set of functionality that will deliver that capability and a lot more. So that\u2019s probably the big payload component of 8.3. We probably do have some customers waiting for it, but we\u2019re certainly not in the category we were a year ago where we had a substantial amount of our customer base waiting for feature parity before they move forward I think for the vast majority of our customer base certainly on a unit basis, those days are passed and the migration has begun.","Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray","All right, great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Your line is open.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital","Can you just talk a little bit more about your comment about the pickup in enterprise spending, what in particular did you see? Did you see some more excitement with regard to your new products or what were you really getting at there and the sustainability of what you\u2019re seeing in the U.S.?","Tom Georgens","Yes, I think first and foremost I think the message is size of deals and we still have tick-up in $1 million plus deals in Q1 which is generally not the quarter we do that. And we saw it in our enterprise accounts, we saw it in a fair number of service providers, big investments in the service providers. As we indicated in the earnings calls, we have a lot of customers that are both enterprise consumers of technology and also service providers themselves, so we\u2019ve seen it really in those two categories. I wouldn\u2019t align it to any individual industry. I\u2019d say most industries are \u2013 there are some clear aggressive buyers, some even financial services have had some good aggressive buyers and a lot of people that are pulling back at the same time. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s universal but I think probably the biggest indicator of confidence in the future is large transactions and also enterprise license agreements which is once again a long-term commitment to NetApp they\u2019re willing to make upfront. So I think that that momentum is heartening. Obviously, it\u2019s early to tell, it\u2019s not ready to call a trend, but we\u2019ve certainly seen more of that in the last four months than we\u2019ve seen in quite a while. And enterprise and the cloud service providers; enterprise is where the money is, cloud service providers is where the growth is and it\u2019s good to see momentum in both of those and certainly interest in the technology. Now that said, independent of just deal size and what appears to be more availability of budget, we are certainly seeing a broader range of our products being sold into these accounts. E-Series brand had another very, very strong quarter. In fact it almost overpowered Q4 to Q1 seasonality. So that\u2019s up substantially year-over-year. OnCommand Insight, which is the portfolio products that we acquired and integrated over the years, had some very, very large transactions, a $9 million transaction at a major energy company. So we\u2019re seeing momentum with that too. A big portion that we\u2019ve been telling our team is that in these enterprise accounts, we need to be selling the entire portfolio because we have compelling solutions there. So that\u2019s been a big push over the last six months. So we\u2019re certainly seeing that. So to your second point, I certainly think that the strength of the portfolio and the breadth of the portfolio is giving us more selling opportunities into those accounts. But that said, the broader trend of larger transactions of longer term commitments is also gratifying as well and I think that\u2019s independent of the portfolio.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon, guys. I was just hoping if you\u2019ll talk a little bit when it comes to your October quarter guide, specifically how you\u2019re thinking about the public sector tracking in the October quarter? I think historically that segment has been up 40%, 45% for you guys on a sequential basis. Do you expect to compare the level of growth going forward in this October quarter or do you have a different set of expectations there?","Nick Noviello","Sure. This is Nick. We are going to expect a sequential increase in the business for sure. But as you know, over the last couple of years here we have moved through sequestration, we\u2019ve moved through shutdown, we\u2019ve moved through a variety of things that have obviously impacted the end result of the U.S. public sector. So we have just like every quarter really started with a bottom up forecast of the business including in the U.S. public sector. We expect a sequential increase. We\u2019re not calling a specific percentage for that. I wouldn\u2019t want to do that on this call. It\u2019s built into the guidance we\u2019ve given you. And we look at that just like we look at the Americas commercial, just like we look at the things Tom talked about in terms of enterprise, buyers and large transactions. So, all of that is built in. Again, we expect a sequential increase for sure. We\u2019ve got a little bit more budget clarity here for sure. We at least hope we don\u2019t see shutdown. There\u2019s nothing like that on the horizon right now, but that\u2019s all built in.","Tom Georgens","Yes, I\u2019d just echo Nick\u2019s comments about more budget clarity. Last year we were finishing a fiscal year which the sequester was in effect and then transitioning into a period where the government could conceivably get and ultimately did get shut down, both of which happened within our quarter. And I\u2019d say that where we are now it isn\u2019t that we\u2019ve seen a massive reflex of bounce back in spending but there\u2019s a lot more budget certainty. So I think we have a little bit better understanding that the end of the fiscal year dynamics for the government will be more reminiscent of prior years than last year, and that\u2019s baked into the guidance that we gave going forward.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot and congrats on the quarter guys.","Tom Georgens","Thank you.","Nick Noviello","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Kelleher with D. A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks for taking the question. Most of mine have been answered. I was just wondering if you might give us an update on the Amazon partnership. I know you talked a little bit about cloud, but I don\u2019t know if you could talk a little bit more about that one specifically?","Tom Georgens","Well, I think we\u2019re looking to do a number of things both in terms of partnering and as a leverager of their infrastructure. But one of the things that we\u2019re clearly doing with NetApp private storage and the concept of NetApp private storage is that the data will reside on the customers\u2019 network likely at a colo facility but connected to the customers\u2019 network and have access through a set of technologies that gave them high bandwidth access to the compute forms and the long and the short of it is for an Amazon web services type of analogy. What the customer can do is maintain control and data stewardship of their data yet have access to the elastic compute and the ability to have instant access to a very, very large server form and likewise downsize at the same time and basically have all the benefits and the flexibility of the elastic computer of Amazon without having to have any of the concerns about security and data ownership. So they maintain control of their data and have access to the flexible compute and get a substantial value of the flexibility that [ViPR] (ph) scales can provide at a fraction of the risk. What we\u2019ve done this past quarter is that we\u2019ve actually added Azure to that mix and as a result they can do the same thing with Azure. In our Analyst Day that we did this year with our industry analysts, we demonstrated the ability to interoperate between the two and basically run an application in one, send it over and operate in the other. And the value of that and the extension of the NPS vision which initially was really about data stewardship and access to flexible compute is now really about multi cloud. And that is I can effectively have a legitimate multi-cloud strategy that I can have resources available to me from Amazon, I can have resources available to be from Microsoft. And if I hold the data then I can truly broker the multi-cloud environment for our customers. That\u2019s really where we\u2019re heading with the NetApp private storage is the idea of multi-cloud. Our customers are not giving control of the data and therefore being locked into a specific cloud provider. They can have access to the flexible computing networking on multiple players yet they still own their data and they still have all of the data stewardship, all the data responsibility and all the security protection that they would have as if it was on their own infrastructure. So that\u2019s really the vision of NetApp private storage; access to the flexible computing, the flexibility and economics of the server networking that that provides yet maintain control of their storage without subjecting themselves to any of the intellectual property and security risk. So that\u2019s really where we\u2019re going with that. I think it has really significant value to enterprises. There are a lot of customers who hone the appeal of maintaining control of their data, whether it be for flexibility or cloud mobility, has tremendous value to them but they also want the elasticity of the compute models that Microsoft and Amazon and an ever increasing set of other providers can ultimately provision for them. That\u2019s really the play there is how do we bring the cloud as a resource to bear with its economics and its flexibility and how do we make that consumable by the enterprise in a seamless and secure fashion so they can make it an integral part of their overall operating environment.","Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty, please check your mute button.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Tom, can you help us reconcile the commentary on more large deals and just an overall better enterprise and service provider spending environment with still low-single-digit growth in the branded business? And does enterprise and service provider strength come at the expense of deals through the channel given that indirect mix decrease for the first time since '08 this quarter?","Tom Georgens","Yes, I think there\u2019s a couple of points there. I think one of the other outlets for the renewed activity that we see and I like I said the bookings and the revenue have a certain timeline to them is that we \u2013 and one of the areas where a lot of that will go is into deferred balance. And we actually saw deferred revenue increase $135 million year-over-year. So it\u2019s some of the things that we do. I talked about the launch transaction we did in OnCommand. That\u2019s entirely a ratable deal for us, that\u2019s entirely in the deferred balance and not recognized in this particular quarter. And a lot of longer term transactions we\u2019re doing with our partners whether it be enterprise license agreements or enterprise service agreements, those are also ratable over time. So some of the manifestation of the increased momentum would be in revenue growth and the branded improved from last quarter but it basically store only 1%. On the other hand, we\u2019re also seeing a big increase in the deferred balance which is another place where some of that business activity will ultimately lie and that will come back through the revenue line over time of course. And the other question was\u2026?","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Should we expect that indirect declines (indiscernible) through service providers?","Tom Georgens","Yes, I think two things on the indirect, one of which is in the indirect numbers the OEM business. And if you back the OEM business out, the percentage of our business through the channel in Q1 this quarter was actually higher than it was each of the last three years. But that said, with the enterprise business, some of that enterprise business does flow through our more sophisticated and larger channel partners and some of it does not. So I think that as we do more enterprise business, the likelihood that some of that will flow through some of our purely direct channels is higher and as a result that will also take the number down. So it\u2019s not a consequence of any strategy that we\u2019ve made or any change of investment, at least not in the near term. It\u2019s more of just that we see more of the enterprises, the enterprises are more likely to be direct than the midsized business. As a result, we see some variability, but overall no change to strategy. And even on a Q1 to Q1 compared over the last three years, we still saw channels, a greater percentage of the mix than any of those prior years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019d like to go back to the opportunity with Data ONTAP and cluster mode capabilities. With now having a full refresh product family in your portfolio, is there any kind of quantitative context you can provide with regard to how much of your installed base is running cluster mode today? What the age of that installed base looks like? And what I\u2019m really trying to get at is what\u2019s the upgrade cycle, how are you thinking about that opportunity over the next several quarters?","Tom Georgens","Yes. I think it\u2019s safe to assume that the installed base which has been assembled over a very long period of time is still primarily 7-Mode, and some of that will stay. Some of our customers will stay in 7-Mode and just put new applications. In Clustered ONTAP I think it varies across the board. I think what we see in general is that most of the upgrade activity to Clustered ONTAP also comes in conjunction with a hardware upgrade, so they don\u2019t do the transition twice. And when there\u2019s a significant gap in time between when they believe they\u2019ll be able to go live with Clustered ONTAP they\u2019re more likely to basically do a hardware upgrade now and then basically wait in time. But the closer they get together, they would love to do the hardware upgrade and the software upgrade at the same time. So I think that some of what we\u2019ve been seeing over the last six months is that customers have evaluated the product, they\u2019ve tested it. It has the feature sets that they need, they\u2019ve proven it in their lab and now particularly with the hardware refresh, they can go ahead and do a hardware refresh in their environment and do the upgrade at the same time. If they were not confident on Clustered ONTAP then I suspect they would be deferring hardware purchases. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re completely through that cycle and that\u2019s not a concern anymore but I certainly believe that waiting for the release of Clustered ONTAP that they could actually run in production, delaying hardware purchases, but I still think there\u2019s some of that \u2013 I think that that\u2019s been diminished over the last six months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Associates","Great. Thank you. Tom, I wanted to ask about FlexPod, strong again and we hear good things in the channel. We\u2019re seeing more converged solutions and hearing more about hyper converged. FlexPod\u2019s likely a material percentage of revenue now. Is there still innovation that can be done there and is the growth rate sustainable?","Tom Georgens","The answer to both those questions is yes. And we\u2019ve got a low line of things around innovation, particularly around some of the value proposition of Clustered ONTAP and translating that to the entire FlexPod whether it be non-disruptive operations or scalability, all of those types of things I think are all really, really big and important plays for us. Take FlexPod, actually even further up market and some more mission critical applications. So I think we clearly see a lot of strength there. We\u2019ve also seen integration of FlexPod with E-Series now, eventually target a different set of workloads. And obviously some joint development activity around newer technologies like OpenStack that are strategic to both of us particularly in the service provider space. So I think there\u2019s no end of \u2013 certainly no near-term end of innovation that we can be doing together to basically drive this business forward. And that is only on the product side. There\u2019s also a bit of market side in terms of positioning the products, better alignment of our partners, more global deployment of this technology. In my interaction with Cisco, in my interaction with John Chambers, there is no congratulation here. The question is how do we take the business to the next level and continue to generate growth for both of us. This is a meaningful business for us even at their scale. It\u2019s a meaningful business for them. They\u2019ve made that abundantly clear to us and as a result, doubling the business from here over some timeframe is meaningful for both of us and those are the types of things that we\u2019re trying to talk about and those are the type of things we\u2019re trying to get into the budgets planned and moving forward. So, yes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any let up on FlexPod. Certainly, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve reached terminal velocity of that product by any means.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Associates","I appreciate the color, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Maynard Um - Wells Fargo","Hi. Thank you. Looking at your free cash flow as a percentage of sales is about 10.5%. Q1 is usually seasonally low so presumably you\u2019re on track to that 17% to 19% target. But when you look at what\u2019s happening now in the ELA cycle helping the deferred revenues, are you just being conservative on that ratio for the year or do you think you can get to the low 20s like you have in the past? Can you just walk us through some of the dynamics to those numbers? Thanks.","Nick Noviello","Hi, Maynard. It\u2019s Nick. First of all, I\u2019d say the guidance for the year and the discussion in that high-teens type of level stands to first quarter. We have a lot of pieces of the business. We talk about the dynamics of the business for the rest of the year, how we\u2019ve maintained guidance at this point in time. Sure there\u2019s a difference in terms of Q1 versus Q1 last year in terms of free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. There\u2019s a couple of points and I made those points in the script on those. But this is a strong cash generating company and we continue to do quite well there. That is built into the guidance and I think our expectations remain consistent at this point in time, no net change. Obviously, as things or if things do change, we\u2019ll give you that point of view when it\u2019s necessary.","Maynard Um - Wells Fargo","I guess the real question was if the deferred revenues are increasing because of the ELAs, I guess what are the offsetting items that are not allowing that deferred revenue to drive that cash flow to a greater level this year?","Nick Noviello","So just Q1, as an example, so on a year-over-year basis, the cash \u2013 deferred revenue is up $135 million. That is better than what we\u2019ve done in the past. The sequential decline is less. We\u2019ll have to look at all those pieces. ELAs are not an occurrence that is happening every day, right, in any form. There are elements of this business model as it grows and as we look at different business models and sell those, all of those will be built into our guide over time, but they are emerging. So these are pieces of business, the deferred revenues for the company over $3 billion, so in terms of moving the needle on free cash flow as a percentage of revenue and that type of number, that\u2019s going to be \u2013 it\u2019s not an immediate light switch; one way of 20% or another way of 20% is the way I\u2019d look at it. And as things change over time, we\u2019ll certainly give you that guidance over time. The net is a strong cash flow generating company. It\u2019s going to continue that way and the ELAs, how we sell business, we\u2019re going to be thinking about the cash generating side as well along the way.","Tom Georgens","And specifically for Q1 I think \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t put Q1 as a trend. We had bonuses paid in Q1 and I think thanks to our employees the numbers were higher than last year (indiscernible) tax settlement. We had a few other things that are out there. So I think the long-term cash generation of the business particularly when you add in the higher gross margin and the higher operating margin I think still remains very, very robust.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open.","Jim Suva - Citi Research","Thank you. Congratulations to you and your team there. My question is concerning gross margins. It looks like you had much better than expected gross margins, so congratulations on that. And if I recall right back at your Investor Day in June, you were kind of implying or stated that gross margins for the year should be like 63% to 64%. So can you help me understand the cost behind the beat in the solid guide and how I bridge that with your full year guidance of 63% to 64%, because it looks like we\u2019re actually tracking quite a bit above that gross margin goal for this year? Thank you.","Nick Noviello","Sure, Jim, it\u2019s Nick. So, certainly, we gave that 63% to 64% guide for the year. The two pieces here and I talked about it a little bit in the scripted comments are on the product gross margin and the services gross margin. So each of them has a couple of different pieces to it and let me walk you through it. So on the product gross margin, I talked about product mix, I talked about supply chain savings and I talked about warranty. Now those things can move around and in fact in past quarters, what I\u2019ve indicated on the supply chain savings is we generally realize it or recognize it and then we pass some of it through or a lot of it through depending upon what it is. If it\u2019s on commodities, we pass it straight through to customers. And there will be a timing difference between the time we update the price list versus sometimes when we recognize the save. So that\u2019s something that will move. So if you were to say, hey, Nick, at this point in time product gross margin should just continue to go up, that\u2019s not necessarily \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t necessarily agree with that because we have to look at the timing of the pass through of items, the type of business we\u2019re doing and blend that altogether on product gross margin. On service gross margins, a little bit of a different set of statistics going on. Number one is we have to look at service revenues and what types of service revenues those are. And if those are hardware maintenance contract revenues or if those are professional services revenues, those have different margin profiles associated with them and the other thing on services that we have to look at and we talked about from time to time is investments in the services infrastructure, because in Q1 versus Q4 I would look at the performance here as a bit of leveraging the expense base of the structure that\u2019s there. But as we look at installed base and installed base growth, remember we invest ahead of it to make sure that we are fully capable of servicing that installed base as it comes to fruition. So, yes, benefits on gross margin here in the first quarter of the year, we feel very good about that. We\u2019re going to continue pushing on all of those levers. But we\u2019re not changing that full year view because on the product side of the fence, the pass-throughs, sometimes the competitiveness we want to put into transactions or the services side on the investments and the infrastructure, those things can change and we will run those levers over the course of the year.","Jim Suva - Citi Research","Congratulations, again. Got it. Thanks.","Tom Georgens","Thank you. The one thing I want to add on the gross margin side is Nick talked about the savings. I think the team \u2013 we\u2019ve talked a lot about products that go to market, but I think the team has done a remarkable job operationally to really drive efficiencies into our supply chain and we\u2019ve realized that benefit last year. We\u2019re looking to drive it this year. The other thing I wouldn\u2019t underestimate is I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any coincidence that the gross margins have improved as the value proposition of Clustered ONTAP became better understood by our sales force and our customers. The industry is littered with companies that are talking about declining gross margins. At NetApp it\u2019s at the highest gross margins in our history and up three points year-over-year. So I think we feel really, really good about that. Now on the other hand, we also reserved the right to use that gross margin advantage to create opportunities for ourselves where we see them, whether it be new markets or new accounts or new opportunities. So that\u2019s also factored into this is that if we believe there\u2019s an opportunity, not to broadly lose discipline on discounting because we certainly don\u2019t want to do that, but for strategic markets or strategic accounts we\u2019re certainly willing to be very, very aggressive with the product line. So I\u2019m really pleased operationally. I think we\u2019ve done really, really smart things there but I think it\u2019s a validation of a value proposition in particular that our margins are increasing while others are decreasing, but we also reserve the right to use that for competitive advantage in the right circumstances.","Jim Suva - Citi Research","Great. Congratulations, again.","Tom Georgens","Thanks.","Operator","Our last question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is open.","Steve Milunovich - UBS","Thanks. I wonder if you know what percentage of your capital shift today is flash and what impact that has on margin as it increases?","Tom Georgens","See I don\u2019t have that off the top of my head. I do know that our capacity increased 23% year-over-year in the aggregate and flash is a greater percentage that it\u2019s been in the past not surprisingly, although we see flash in my incarnations; that\u2019s disk capacity. We also shift flash as plug-in cards as a cashing product. In terms of overall gross margin, I can\u2019t imagine it has a material impact at this point in time and we ship it in various points. So I would not make the claim that flash overall is either driving the gross margins up or taking it down. But at the end of the day, flash as a capacity driver is not the biggest one. Clearly, if customers are looking for capacity they\u2019re going to go to a hard drive. So flash is primarily a performance driver. So the likelihood that\u2019s going to be a very large percentage of our revenue at any point in time I think is pretty low. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the data center looks like. Flash is going to accelerate low latency, high performance workload and as a result, it will be optimized for that. But the economics of it are such that it will always be cheaper to store less critical, less active data on solid-state drives. And I think the challenge and the ultimate value add to be provided to the enterprise is the company that can actually manage that migration over the data lifecycle to put the most important data on flash and everything else on hard drives recognizing that over time the active data becomes idle and has new active data that needs to be stored, and that\u2019s a key part of our value add. So kind of a long answer to your question is I don\u2019t expect to flash to be a meaningful or a very large percent of our overall capacity even through it\u2019s growing very, very quickly and not all of our flash is going to be in the form of hard drives. Some of it will also be in the form of plug-in boards because I think that flash and all of its substantiations are going to matter to the enterprise and we intend to do all of them.","Steve Milunovich - UBS","Thanks.","Operator","This ends our Q&A session today. I\u2019ll turn it back to management for closing remarks.","Tom Georgens","Well, first of all, thank you for your interest in NetApp. I think we\u2019re pleased with the outcome of the quarter coming in above what we thought we would on the guidance and obviously very, very strong on the EPS and the profitability side. Gross margins had an all-time high and very, very strong operating margin in roughly flat environments still generating a point of operating margin leverage.","So I think we see clearly momentum around Clustered ONTAP, around branded E-Series, around OnCommand. This past quarter we spent a fair amount of time with industry analysts and financial analysts and customers, in fact I saw particularly talking about our cloud strategy or where we go from here. I think our ability to win and gain share in the market as it exists today, I think is very, very strong.","I think we\u2019ve reinvigorated our core offerings when I think the core offerings of a lot of our competitors are languishing, but more than today we also talked about where we\u2019re going in the future, how we\u2019re going to help customers get from where they are today to where they want to go particularly in integrating the cloud and how NetApp is going to continue to be relevant and a leader and an attractive opportunity going forward.","So thanks again for your time and see you again in 90 days.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today\u2019s program.

Welcome to NetApp\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and answer-session and instructions will be given at that time.","I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","Kris Newton","Hello and thank you for joining us on our Q1 fiscal year 2018 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2018 and our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including global political macroeconomic and market conditions and our ability to expand our total available market, enhance our product offerings, execute new business models, manage our gross profit margins, capitalize on our market position, maintain execution and continue our capital allocation strategy.","Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2017 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated.","I will now turn the call over to George.","George Kurian","Thanks, Kris. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With focused market-leading innovation and disciplined execution, we delivered a strong start to fiscal year 2018. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance range and gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share were all above our guidance. NetApp is winning because we deliver solutions that enable our customers to harness the value of their data and thrive in a digital world.","In addition to delivering solid results across the board, we further strengthened our leadership position by enhancing our all-flash array and converged infrastructure offerings, and augmenting our Data Fabric strategy. We expanded our strategic partnership with Microsoft Azure and introduced new hybrid cloud software solutions. The accelerating turnaround of NetApp underscores our unique technology leadership and expanding opportunity.","As I have said before, NetApp is transforming to align our strategic focus, investments and execution with the changing needs of our customers. The first phase of our transformation put us on a solid foundation by shifting our business to the growth areas of the market, bringing our cost structure in line with our opportunities, and substantially improving our leadership capability and execution.","As we shift to the second phase of our transformation, we are building on that foundation to deliver sustained and profitable growth. We are focused on three key priorities. First, to drive sustained top line growth, we will remain focused on the high growth areas of the market, as well as address new customers and new buying centers at existing customers. Second, to increase profitability as we grow, we will continue our disciplined approach to realign our resources against the biggest opportunities and to focus on productivity to expand our innovation. And third, we will maintain our focus on capital allocation, balancing shareholder returns with investment in the business for long-term growth.","Like NetApp, our customers are transforming to grow revenue and improve productivity. Through new digital business models and the Internet of Things, companies are harnessing the power of their data to enable new customer touch points, uncover business opportunities, and optimize operations. These imperatives require advanced data management capabilities and the new class of hybrid cloud data services. To address these needs, NetApp is delivering a Data Fabric that simplifies and integrates data management across cloud and on-premises environments. With our solutions, services and partnerships, we empower our customers to harness the power of the hybrid could, build next-generation data centers and modernize storage through data management.","In addition to driving technical innovations, we have aligned our go-to-market teams, to focus on the strategic solutions in our portfolio, aligned sales resources to acquire new customers and attack new buying centers, improved sales discipline to expand gross margin, and are leveraging our unique position to access customers through multiple pathways tailored to their needs.","Our $55 billion market opportunity consists of legacy segments that are in decline and newer segments that are growing rapidly, driven by digital transformation. We have already transitioned our business away from the declining segments to the data-driven high-growth segments of all-flash arrays, converged infrastructure, and hybrid cloud. We will further expand our opportunity with the general availability of our hyper-converged solutions, later this calendar year.","Let me discuss the results we have had in these high growth markets, before turning to innovation and customer success.","We continued to substantially outpace the growth of the all-flash array market and competitors, both large and small in that space. In Q1, our all-flash array business inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services grew 95% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $1.5 billion. Our strength in flash is also driving our success in SAN and converged infrastructure markets. Our share gains in the SAN market reflect our acquisition of new customers and new share of wallet within existing customers.","The All Flash FlexPod helped strengthen our number two position in the converged infrastructure market and contributed to the 26% year-over-year growth of FlexPod revenue reported in IDC\u2019s quarterly converged systems tracker for calendar Q1 2017. We are outpacing and winning against full-stack vendors with our best-of-breed solution. The success of our strategic direction is evident in the continued momentum in our strategic solutions which were 69% of net product revenue in Q1, up 22% year-over-year.","The industry is in the early innings of the move from disk-based storage to flash as customers modernize existing datacenters and build next generation datacenters to lower the total cost of ownership while gaining greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications.","We have a significant growth opportunity ahead as we penetrate our installed base and displace competitors\u2019 installations with our cloud integrated all-flash solutions. NetApp is leading this transition to flash by providing customers with solutions that deliver unrivaled scale, speed and data services. Validating the innovation leadership and momentum of our all-flash array business, Gartner again recognized NetApp as a Leader in its Magic Quadrant for Solid-State Arrays.","In the quarter, we increased the storage efficiency of our All Flash FAS solutions with expanded in line deduplication across multiple pools of storage. Just last week at the Flash Memory Summit, we demonstrated future flash storage innovations of NVMe over Fabric and storage-class memory. NetApp is uniquely positioned to deliver these new innovations because our approach allows our customers to non-disruptively integrate these advancements into their ONTAP and SolidFire data management architectures.","Customers are also choosing the All Flash FAS to replace legacy tier 1 SAN installations because of its performance and density combined with industry-leading data management capabilities. At a U.S.-based financial services company, we replaced a competitor\u2019s SAN installation with our All Flash FAS system, which provide a unified scale out architecture and the resilience needed for tier 1 workloads, and are also modular enough to accommodate the customer\u2019s future datacenter consolidation plans. We consolidated SAN and NAS workloads into a single platform, allowing the company to leverage ONTAP as its data management standard.","New innovations further strengthened our leadership position in the converged infrastructure market. In Q1, we introduced FlexPod SF, a SolidFire-based converged infrastructure solution that enables digital transformation with high-end predictable performance, programmable agility, and scale out value for multi-tenant environments. Enterprises, cloud service providers and partners choose NetApp because we enable their hybrid cloud strategies through our Data Fabric architecture.","Our approach to hybrid cloud enabled us to make a first-time ever sale to a global leader in the hospitality industry. The customer had spent a significant amount of time and money unsuccessfully trying to realize their cloud mandate with a competitive solution. After purchasing ONTAP Cloud and ONTAP Select licenses, they were able to move a tier 1 application on to ONTAP Cloud running in AWS over a single weekend, and it now runs faster than it had on the competitor\u2019s on-premises solution. This win positions us to not only be the data management platform of choice for their cloud workloads, but also to migrate their on-premises infrastructure from the competitor to NetApp.","The NetApp Data Fabric, simplifies data management across the cloud and on-premises footprint to deliver consistent and integrated hybrid cloud data services, enabling customers to unleash the full power of their data. We continue to innovate in this space, and in Q1, we unreached our solutions, services and partnerships for hybrid cloud data services.","We enhanced OnCommand Insight to provide hybrid cloud infrastructure and monitoring and analytics across the Data Fabric. We also expanded ONTAP functionality to deliver automatic and transparent tiering of inactive data to the cloud.","At the start of Q2, we acquired Green Cloud, a private startup company that created a cloud services, orchestration and management platform for hybrid cloud and multi-cloud environments. Green Cloud augments our team and accelerates our leadership in hybrid services by providing NetApp with the scalable architecture, unique technology and expertise that enhances our ability to integrate and deliver cloud data services.","Additionally, we announced the expansion of our collaboration with Microsoft to include hybrid cloud data services that will deliver enterprise-grade data visibility and insights, data access and control, and data protection and security for customers moving to Microsoft Azure. We will provide updates on this exciting collaboration later this calendar year.","In a hybrid cloud data-driven world, we have an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen and grow our business. Our Data Fabric vision and architecture is being endorsed by not only customers and industry influencers, but also the world\u2019s leading hyperscalers.","Our focus, discipline and emphasis on execution has returned NetApp to growth with expanding margins, increased shareholder value and improving momentum. We saw continued growth in Q1 and expect to accelerate that growth in Q2 and throughout the year. We are helping our customers change the world with data, and that is driving our success.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q1 financial performance and go-forward expectations. Ron?","Ron Pasek","Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers today.","With that, let\u2019s get started.","NetApp delivered another quarter of disciplined execution and strong financial performance, demonstrating the substantial progress we\u2019ve made toward transforming the business, driving sustained growth, and addressing the changing market.","Q1 net revenues of $1.33 billion grew 2% year-over-year and were above the midpoint of our guidance range. Product revenue of $723 million increased 10% year-over-year. This was a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year product revenue growth, driven by our successful pivot to the growth areas of the market.","The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance, and other services revenues of $602 million were down 5% year-over-year. This decline was driven by the following factors: Changes we made to the service pricing several years ago; renewal execution issues in FY 2017; and several years of product revenue declines. It is important to note that total systems under contract increased slightly year-over-year. Although, we generally don\u2019t provide services revenue guidance, we expect the year-over-year headwind for services revenue to lessen in the next several quarters and return to growth in the beginning of the next fiscal year. We are confident in these expectations as our product revenue has returned to growth, and we are seeing improvement in renewal execution from changes that we implemented at the beginning of this fiscal year.","Gross margin of 63.8% was well above our guidance range. Product gross margin of 49.9%, increased approximately 3 points year-over-year due to improved sales discipline. Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased about 2 points year-over-year.","Operating expenses of $637 million decreased 2% year-over-year and as expected increased 3% sequentially. As I discussed during our financial analyst day, the sequential increase was primarily due to merit increases. As a percent of net revenue, operating expenses of 48%, represented almost 2.5 points of improvement year-over-year, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing transformation efforts.","Operating margin of 15.8% increased almost 4 points year-over-year and was above our guidance range due to higher revenue, higher gross margin, and lower operating expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.4% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 278 million. EPS of $0.62 was $0.05 above the high-end of our guidance range due to higher revenue and improved gross margins.","We closed Q1 with $5.3 billion in cash and short-term investments with approximately 8% held by our domestic entities. In Q1, we repurchased $150 million of our shares and paid approximately $54 million in cash dividends. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which will be paid on October 25, 2017.","To reiterate, we are committed to completing by the end of May 2018 the remaining $644 million of the share repurchase program that we announced in February 2015. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue was down just over 1% year-over-year due to the same dynamics that drove the decline in services revenue, I discussed earlier.","Our cash conversion cycle extended 3 days year-over-year, reflecting a 12-day increase in days inventory outstanding due to higher levels of SSD raw materials on hand, partially offset by a 10-day improvement in days payable outstanding as a result of our transformation initiatives. DSO at 36 days was relatively flat year-over-year.","As I noted last quarter, we continue to exercise our deep business and technical partnerships with our NAND and SSD suppliers. We have enough on-hand and committed supply of NAND to meet our requirements now through the end of our fiscal year.","Q1 cash flow from operations was $250 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year. We generated strong free cash flow of $214 million in the quarter; this represents about 16% of net revenues and is an increase of 11% year-over-year.","Now onto guidance. We executed well against our plans in Q1 and are pleased with the significant progress we\u2019ve made toward transforming NetApp to succeed in the changing market. We\u2019re making tough decisions that enable key investments to expand our TAM and drive strong financial performance over the long term. While we still have work to do, we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute against the plans we outlined for fiscal 2018, on our prior earnings call.","To reiterate, we expect our typical seasonal patterns with revenue dollars increasing each quarter. We also expect our year-over-year growth rate to accelerate in the back half of the fiscal year. We expect gross margin of 62% to 63% and operating margin of 18% to 20%. Further, we remain committed to delivering low double-digit EPS growth for the year and free cash flow in the range of 17% to 19% of revenue.","Now onto Q2. We expect net revenue to range between $1.31 billion and $1.46 billion, which at the midpoint, implies approximately 4.5% growth sequentially and 3.4% growth year-over-year. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margin of approximately 63% to 63.5%, reflecting a higher mix of product revenues quarter-to-quarter. We expect operating margins of approximately 16% to 17%. And finally, we expect earnings per share for the second quarter to range from approximately $0.64 to $0.72 per share.","In closing, Q1 was another strong quarter of execution, reflecting a leverage in our business model with 2% year-over-year revenue growth yielding a 35% increase in year-over-year EPS growth. We are pleased with the substantial progress we\u2019ve made to transform the business, drive sustained growth and increase shareholder value.","With that, I will hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?","Kris Newton","We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Joe Wittine","Hi, thanks. If I just have one here, how about a competitive question? Product sales of close to 10% again, how are you seeing the competition respond, specifically with discounting? Have they stepped it up yet or if not, do you expect that to be the next logical step? Thanks.","George Kurian","It\u2019s always been competitive. We have substantial technology differentiation in big and early markets, all-flash arrays, converged infrastructure, hybrid cloud, and we\u2019re executing to our plan. Every deal is competitive, HP, Dell\/EMC, Pure Storage, and some of the smaller vendors, everyone competes fiercely on the whole range of things at their disposal. The fact that we have grown substantially, gained share in virtually every category in our business, and have expanded gross margins substantially in both product and services is clear support for our thesis that we have a unique differentiated position of technology leadership, as well as partnerships, and customers are voting with their wallet in our favor.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Simon Leopold","Maybe following up on competitive landscape. From our discussions with the channel and customers, we\u2019ve got the impression that you benefited for some time from maybe disruption at number of your large competitors, whether it was HP and its spin mergers or Dell\/EMC and their integration; these two activities are going to lap at some point. Could you help us understand, how you see the competitive environment shaping up in terms of those two large competitors, as we look out over the next year or so and they are lapping their integration activities?","George Kurian","I clearly think from a technology standpoint and direction standpoint, there are multiple avenues where we are sustainably differentiated. From the technology standpoint, all-flash arrays, converged infrastructure, storage, resource management, as well as the evolving market for hyper-converged, we have very, very good solutions that are clearly differentiated, both in -- the technology that\u2019s available today as well as those that are to come, both HP and Dell have major holes in their portfolio for the evolution of the all-flash array market. And clearly, we are demonstrating massive differentiation in terms of performance and execution in the converged infrastructure market which is frankly their home turf.","None of these guys have a clear coherent hybrid cloud storage. And so we feel very, very good about our position in the market and are confident. We are in the early stages of the evolution of these markets and yes, they have their own execution challenges to get over, but clearly we feel that we\u2019ve got a really solid lead against them and they\u2019re going to have to come catch us, which is going to take them heck of a long time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna Group. Your question please. ","Dave Ryzhik","Hi, thanks. This is Dave Ryzhik for Mehdi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to clarify in the deferred revenue commentary, Ron. It sounds like services becomes less of headwind. Now, do you expect services to exit fiscal 2018 at growth? And just digging a little deeper on the renewal execution. Was that pricing, did you guys aggressively price, because hardware maintenance declined, I think 8% year-over-year? I just wanted to dig a little deeper there? Thank you.","Ron Pasek","Yes. Thanks, Dave. So we -- I touched on this last quarter as well. Just a reminder, our services revenue is made up of a waterfall and annuity if you will over the last three, four years of transactions. We did make some pricing changes, both at the beginning of FY 2017 and actually back into 2013; we lowered ASPs to become more competitive. However, as you saw that did not affect our services margins. In fact, the services margins have increased the last several quarters.","Added to that, we had several years before Q3 of last year of product revenue declines, we have turned that around; that should help in the second half of this year. And we did have some service execution issues in this back half of FY 2017. So, we have largely focused on place on renewal execution issues. And that\u2019s why I am confident as we continue this fiscal year, the headwind will lessen, and I think you will see services revenue turn around and get back to growth in Q1 of 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is open.","Steve Milunovich","Yes. Thank you. Regarding your all flash product. In terms of the quarter\u2019s shipments, is all flash over half of what you are delivering from an array standpoint and do you still feel that the margins are -- you are pretty neutral between all flash versus disk? ","George Kurian","That\u2019s correct. It\u2019s about the -- it\u2019s about 50%, and we feel very good about the trajectory and the margins of all flash vis-\u00e0-vis hybrid.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your question, please?","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you. I was wondering how the maintenance attached for the flash product compares to the overall portfolio. And is that part of the reason why the hardware maintenance was down a fair amount despite the easy compares, in addition to other things that you highlighted, Ron?","Ron Pasek","So, Wamsi, no, the attach rate is no different on all flash versus spinning disk. And no, it had nothing to do with why service was down. It really was ASP which we did, we planned on doing, and to some extent renewal execution from last year which affects this year more than anything else.","Wamsi Mohan","If I could, a quick clarification. It appears from your guidance that OpEx could be up year-on-year. Is that consistent with your expectations or is that a change from prior expectations? Thank you.","Ron Pasek","Yes. OpEx in Q2 is up very slightly. It\u2019s three factors. One is foreign exchange, it was about $4 million as you bridge Q1 to Q2. The other is the acquisition George mentioned, which is Green Cloud that\u2019s additive to our OpEx. And then, we simply have more variable compensation in Q2. So, was your question, Wamsi, on year-over-year OpEx increase?","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, year-over-year.","Ron Pasek","Yes, it\u2019s just some calendarization and no structural issues. As I mentioned, full year OpEx is only up slightly, essentially just for merit increases.","Operator","Next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street Capital. Your line is open.","Eric Martinuzzi","Yes. Curious about your estimation of installed base penetration on the flash product that to me seems like probably the low-hanging fruit here in the success you are seeing on the product side.","George Kurian","We are in the very early innings of our installed based. It\u2019s less than 10%. And as we said, we\u2019ve gained share in the SAN market which has been the predominant location for all flash storage. We feel very, very good about our position in the all flash NAS market. And as you know, we won many, many awards year-over-year for technological leadership. So, as we see the market for NAS transition as well, we have substantial room to go.","Operator","Next question comes from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Your question, please?","Maynard Um","Hi, thank you. Can you just update us on the changes to your go-to-market and to the compensation. I think it\u2019s now been a little more than three months, and doesn\u2019t look like, there was much of an impact, but curious what impact you\u2019re seeing or if it\u2019s too early to kind of see what the full impact of those changes are?","George Kurian","I think, the things that you should focus in on is the improved results on product revenue and gross margin were due to the compensation changes we\u2019ve made. We\u2019ve also allowed resources to hunt versus farm our installed based, which is allowing us to accelerate our momentum against the competition by acquiring new accounts and new wallet share in existing accounts. So, we feel very, very good about the changes that we\u2019ve made. In terms of renewals, we brought renewed organizational focus as single owner for renewals execution across the company and we\u2019ve got a disciplined approach that makes us feel much more confident about our execution plan. We feel good about the progress year-to-date. We still have more work to do, but early signs are good.","Maynard Um","And then, can you just walk us through some of your vertical markets, places where you\u2019re seeing strengths and softness? And what you\u2019re anticipating in terms of your guidance next quarter from U.S. government? Thanks.","George Kurian","Broadly speaking, we don\u2019t have any specific commentary across the different vertical markets. We see a good balanced book of business and see strength across broad range. All of our Peters [ph] executed well. I mean, if you look at our public sector business, it is essentially mirrors the administration spending priorities. We saw strength in the Department of Defense and relative balance, and the civilian segment or public sector, we think that this will be a normal end of year flush budget. And we feel good about our market share position. We\u2019ve got a broad reach into the market, clearly differentiated technology and long-term relationships with the customers, and feel good about our position there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Katy Huberty","Ron, product margins were up year-on-year and sequential. So, can you just talk to what the drivers were? And when we think about the next few quarters, where could product margins go, assuming memory prices remain elevated and then where do you think that could go longer term in NAND prices ease?","Ron Pasek","So, I think we were pretty clear that one other focus areas for us was product margins. We believe that we were not executing as well as we thought. We did make some changes to compensation as George indicated. I think at our Analyst Day, I didn\u2019t give specific guidance on where product margins would leave -- would end up. But I do think we\u2019re executing well. I think what you\u2019ll see is baked in some of the guidance we gave for the full year of the 62% to 63%. And ultimately, I think that when we have our Analyst Day next year, I\u2019ll give you guide on FY 2019. But I still think we have some ways to go.","Operator","Next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Andrew Nowinski","Thanks for taking the question. A lot of them have been asked, but just a question on SolidFire. I think last year, it was 2% of your total revenue. I know you made some changes to the -- having trained the broader sales forces start selling now versus using specialists. So, I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us any traction on or any color on the traction SolidFire has had this quarter and what you think you can do going forward? Thanks.","George Kurian","SolidFire has been integrated into NetApp go-to-market organization and into the product group. We feel good about the integration so far. We\u2019ve enabled our field sellers as well as our channel partners to be able to sell the technology. It\u2019s part of our strategic portfolio and we\u2019ve accelerated innovations in that portfolio this quarter. In Q1, we announced FlexPod SS, a converged infrastructure solution combining Cisco computer network together with SolidFire storage and data management, we\u2019re excited to bring that to the market and we started to see positive reviews from that. And as we\u2019ve said before, you\u2019ll see us bring a SolidFire base hyper converged solution to market later this calendar year. So, overall, steady as we go. We still have more work to do but we feel good about the work that we\u2019ve done so far.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jayson Noland of Baird. Your question, please?","Jayson Noland","Okay, great. I wanted to ask on NetApp HCI, George, GA. In calendar Q4, I assume you\u2019ve got some betas in the field. I guess, what are your expectations for the second half of this fiscal year? And is this solution competitive to Nutanix and VSAN or is it sort of a different part of the market.","George Kurian","I think, first of all, we have multiple avenues to accelerate the momentum of NetApp. Clearly, we\u2019ve demonstrated that in the all-flash array category and the converged infrastructure category. We have more exciting announcements around the cloud and other areas of our business that you should come to insight to hear about. With regard to the hyper converged solution, as we said, our approach is to bring to the enterprise, an enterprise-grade hyper converged solution that deals with some of the challenges that first generation hyper converged solutions like VSAN and Nutanix has. This is the ability deliver a guaranteed mixed workload performance to have modular scalability and upgradability of your storage environment, and your compute environment as well as to deploy mission-critical workloads like databases and other things beyond VDI, which is where the primary first generation vendors are. So, we feel good. The early reviews of it have been positive from the industry analysts and from the customers and partners that we\u2019ve shared, which really more come to insight.","Operator","Next question comes from Alex Kurtz of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Alex Kurtz","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. George, if you guys continue to execute on the product front here, double-digit growth, could you see kind of revisiting the OpEx growth rates for the business and maybe stepping it up, given some of the dislocation of some of the larger OEMs you compete against?","George Kurian","No, we\u2019re going to continue to stay disciplined. Right? We\u2019ve provided guidance for the year. We think that continuing to prioritize the markets that we compete in and our approach to access customers through partners is a good way to grow our business. We\u2019re seeing the early results and they\u2019ve proven good. We think that we can certainly accelerate the top-line in the second half of the year as we said through the course of the year, because of the momentum we\u2019re seeing. But we\u2019re going to continue to stay disciplined.","Ron Pasek","I would just add that what we talked about at Analyst Day was that transformation was not an event that something we do ongoing. So, we believe we still have work to do; that\u2019s why we believe we can hold our cost structure roughly flat.","Operator","Next question comes from James Kisner of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys. David [ph] for James. Quick question, so, obviously you\u2019ve had very good adoption of strategic revenue. I just wanted to ask question, you saw sequential decline in the proportion of products revenue that was strategic versus legacy. And also, it looks like this is the first time you\u2019ve seen a sequential decline in run rate for the all-flash array. Is there something going on with customer adoption or just who\u2019s ordering when in the year that is causing that?","George Kurian","I think just a couple of things. In terms of the mature business, as we\u2019ve said consistently, mature does not go to zero. Right? There are three components to mature, add-on storage, the OEM business, and 7-Mode. And of those three, the only thing that really goes away over a period of time is 7-Mode, which is already a very, very small number. The mature business did -- we saw the add-on storage component of the mature business grow quite substantially because of the strength of our product revenue in the strategic site to which add-on storage gets attached. That\u2019s the first point.","The second is, with regard to seasonality in the all-flash array business. It\u2019s a big business now. And so we saw the natural seasonality in our business on the sequential side. If you compare year-on-year, however, we\u2019re dramatically outpacing the market and our business is big numbers. And we intend to sustain that year-on-year momentum through the fiscal year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot and thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess to start with, just on your product growth number that you\u2019ve had so far, a question get asked a lot of time on NetApp is, what\u2019s your ability to sustain this product growth as you get to the back half of the year in the Jan and April quarters when compares presumably get tougher? So, just maybe help us understand, what are the two, three big levers you have that can show positive product growth in the back half? Thank you.","George Kurian","I think there are sort of three of four things that I would say, Amit. I think the first is, we have clear differentiated technology leadership and momentum in large markets like all-flash arrays, converged infrastructure and the hybrid cloud where we are in the early innings of a multiyear transition of very, very large enterprise infrastructures. And we\u2019re demonstrating our technology leadership by outpacing competitors of all sizes and shapes.","The second is that our portfolio is going to expand through the course of the year. Without telling you more, I would ask you to come to NetApp Insight and see some of the exciting innovations that we have. We\u2019ve demonstrated some of them at Flash Memory Summit. Clearly, hyper converge is another arrow in our quiver, it\u2019s for the second half of the year. But, we have multiple ways to accelerate the momentum of our business through the fiscal year, and we feel very confident about that.","Operator","The next question comes from Srini Nandury of Summit Redstone. Your line is open.","UnidentifiedAnalyst","All right. Thank you for taking my question. This is Amit again. [Ph] George, can you comment on your conversations you\u2019re having with your channel partners, technical partners and customers on the upcoming HCI product and more importantly, do any of your customers currently have this product on beta trial or early access? Thank you.","George Kurian","As I said, I think HCI is one of many avenues for growth of NetApp. Our approach to HCI is to deliver enterprise-grade data services and modular flexibility that allows customers to deploy production workloads and mixed infrastructures on an HCI is different from the first generation HCI vendors. And so, we have had early demos and feedback from partners who are excited about it. Clearly, we got to get in the market and start to accelerate momentum, once we are in the market, but we feel good so far, clearly differentiated approach just like we brought to the solid-state storage market where we have already for the enterprise customers used the solid-state technology, not the early adopter niche providers. And so, we feel good about where we are.","Operator","Next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one question for me please. You mentioned that mix is going to help your gross margin this quarter. Can you be a little bit more specific on what mix drivers are most important and then what you are thinking in terms of, directionally, about mix and margins in the rest of the fiscal year? Thanks.","Ron Pasek","Yes. Sorry, Steven. I think what you\u2019ll see on mix is that a portion of product revenue -- product margin to total revenue margin will be up in Q2. Service revenue is basically flat, which are higher revenue and higher margin -- I am sorry, higher margin. So, the mix question really is just between product and services margin, and it\u2019s a slight headwind to margin in Q2, still above the 63% but a slight headwind. And what I said was, as you go to through the year, product revenue continues to grow, so all things being equal, it is a little bit of a headwind to margin on the total margin basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. The details have been great so far. I have one question. In your prepared comments, you talked about some success, what I believe was Azure, cloud provider ","Azure. Can you help us understand, when you look at the relationship long-term, do you expect it to kind of mirror [ph] your portfolio as far as product versus software versus services or is it more leaned towards one of those three buckets, or how should we think about that and the profitability as such? Thank you so much.","George Kurian","I think it\u2019s early to comment about the specifics of the Microsoft relationship. We will have more news later this calendar year. We are really excited about the collaboration because it is multi-faceted. On the cloud side, it\u2019s developing new cloud data services based on NetApp ONTAP innovation that will be offered on the Azure cloud. And it will allow us to not only enable our customers to be successful in hybrid cloud architectures and deployment, but also will bring multiple competitors workloads to NetApp infrastructure on-premises as well as to the public cloud.","On-premises, we have agreed to engineering collaboration to deliver an integrated solution architecture that combines Azure and Azure stock with NetApp ONTAP, so that customers can unlock greater value from their data and speed the migration of enterprise apps to that next-generation architecture. And we are also working with Microsoft on integrating our data fabric technology, technologies like our FabricPool, automated storage tiering technology, or to enable our Cloud Control, backup archival and compliance solution for Office 365, so it\u2019s a broad-based multidimensional relationship, and we think that it will be a substantial differentiator for us in the market and is going to be sustainably differentiated for multiple years on a very, very broad basis. So stay tuned. We are really excited to tell you more as the services come to market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi. Ron, I was just curious on the gross margin along the full year guidance, 62% to 63%. Clearly, you are above that and guiding to higher than that in second quarter. So, the first half well above that rate. I know you said product gross margins would pressure the margins in the second half of the year; over the past couple of years, you haven\u2019t seen that much pressure. So, I guess my question is, is that number a conservative or do you really expect gross margins to be below that 62%, which is where it would be to get to that 62%, 63% for the full year? Thanks.","Ron Pasek","Yes. No, I think what I was trying to say, Sherri, is that it is simply the mix of product margin versus services margin in the second half is much higher that puts a little pressure on the overall margin rate. But the product margins that you are seeing in Q1 and what\u2019s implied in Q2 should hold. So, I think what we are saying is it\u2019s just a mix issue between the products and services margins. That\u2019s it.","Operator","Next question comes from Mark Kelleher of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Mark Kelleher","Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Most of mine have been asked. But Ron, I was just looking at the balance sheet, the commercial paper notes were up. Can you just touch on that, what\u2019s that, that was up pretty significantly?","Ron Pasek","Yes. So, -- and I touched on this at the Analyst Day; there was a question about whether we would be in more debt to complete the share repurchase program that we have in place. And we did in fact acquired about $400 million more in commercial paper. And that\u2019s simply to complete that commitment. We have about $644 million left which we should be done with rest of that by the end of May of 2018.","Operator","Next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your question please.","Mark Moskowitz","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just want to come back to services attach. Can you help us understand, if your system install activity is doing quite well, is that really implying that your services or maintenance attach is a lot less per customer, and is that as incentive to win more business or is that reflective of all-flash arrays just don\u2019t require as much spares and maintenance? Any help would be greatly appreciated.","Ron Pasek","Yes. So, Mark, when you sell a new system, be it flash or anything else, you sell a three-year service contract. You recognize the revenue ratably every month over the life of that contract. So, yes, our attach rate on these systems is actually quite good. But it doesn\u2019t move the services number to any great extent because it\u2019s a huge number to move. So, most of the variance you are seeing is as I said, pricing changes we made several years ago, and then renewals on other things coming up for renewal that are older systems where we have improved our execution but did have some execution issues in the second half of last year.","Operator","Next question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Your line is open.","Nehal Chokshi","Yes, thanks for the question. So, look, you guys put up 10% year-over-year growth on the product revenue, that\u2019s off really difficult comps and the prior quarter hit 12% year-over-year growth on the product revenue. So, this seems to be very strong growth and yes, you have the installed based, you had three years of year-over-year decline, so that\u2019s a little bit of challenge. But once that normalizes out, why shouldn\u2019t you guys be more confident that you can do much better than the low single-digit year-over-year growth that you have been talking about?","George Kurian","We feel very good about our position. As we said, we have differentiated technology partnerships and pathways to market across three or four very large markets that are in the early innings of their development, all-flash arrays, converged infrastructure and hybrid cloud. I think what we are focused on is executing, executing flawlessly. You\u2019ve seen us post good numbers. We\u2019ve got do that through the course of this year, and we see accelerating momentum as we said, through the second half of this year. And you know what, we\u2019ll provide more guidance as we see the execution plans play out. But so far, we feel extremely good. And as we said, we are substantial and differentiated technology leadership against competitors, both big and small, and they\u2019ve got a long way to catch us.","Operator","Our last question comes from Rod Hall of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Rod Hall","Great. Thanks guys for fitting me in there. I just had two. I noticed that your inventory levels are down just a little bit on last quarter. And so, I wanted to just check in on your -- where you\u2019re at with memory hedging, NAND hedging. Do you have enough supply to kind of keep you hedged on the margins for a couple of more quarters or where do we stand at? And then I also wanted to come back to the sales execution point, the new I guess sales comp or incentive program. What surprised you there? Clearly, this margin was surprisingly good. Were you just surprised about how quickly the sales team took out those new programs, or can you give us a little bit more color about what the positive surprise there was? Thanks.","Ron Pasek","So, let\u2019s start with inventory. So, inventory has a normal seasonal pattern; it should decrease from Q4, because that\u2019s our highest quarter. What I tried to articulate in my prepared remarks is we did -- if you look at inventory year-over-year, Q1 this year versus last year, it could go up and simply and mostly because of positions we did take on the end supply. So that was conscious and something we thought the right thing to do. I\u2019ll start on the compensation. So, I think typically what we see is, when we pay people to do things, they do them. And I think in this case, we had what we said is we had paid some of sales management to focus on gross margin and this year we\u2019re paying all sales management to focus on gross margin; it\u2019s having a good effect and the intended effect.","Rod Hall","NAND question, guys. Could you just say how far out you\u2019re hedged at this point? Is it a couple of quarters, is it further\u2026","Ron Pasek","What I said in my remarks is that we have secured supply to now the end of our fiscal year. So, until April of next year.","George Kurian","The last time we updated you guys, it was till the end of our calendar year; this time, it\u2019s till the end of our fiscal year. So, we\u2019ve got good technological and commercial relationships with the leading NAND suppliers and we\u2019ve got supply assured till the end of our fiscal year. With regard to the question on sales compensation execution. Listen, we\u2019re pleased with the results and our sales team\u2019s done a real good job. We\u2019re one quarter in, we\u2019ve got to do that a few more quarters in a row, and then we\u2019ll be very confident. So, we feel good about the start.","Kris Newton","Thank you very much, Rod.

My name is Anthony, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Kris Newton. Kris, you may begin.","Kris Newton","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are our CEO, Tom Georgens; and our CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, the supplemental commentary, our financial tables and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections, including our financial outlook for Q2, the benefits to us and our customers of our products, our expectations regarding future competitive positions, and expected benefits of partnerships and alliances, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including general economic and market conditions, such as the macroeconomic environment and matters specific to the company's business, such as customer demand for and acceptance of our products and services. We describe these factors in our accompanying press release, which we have filed on an 8-K with the SEC, as well as in our 10-K and 10-Q reports also on file with the SEC, and available on our website, all of which are incorporated by reference into today's discussion.","All numbers discussed today are GAAP, unless stated otherwise. To see the reconciling items between the non-GAAP and GAAP, you may refer to the table in our press release, our supplemental commentary, or on our website.","In a moment, Nick will walk you through some additional color on our financial results, and then Tom will walk you through his perspective on the businesses this quarter.","I'll now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Overall first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations. Results were influenced not only by Q4 to Q1 seasonality in the business, but also by a weak macro environment and FX headwinds. Revenue of just under $1.45 billion was at the midpoint of our Q1 guidance range, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 exceeded the high-end of our previous guidance. Product, SEM and service revenue were all within the ranges of our Q1 projections. SEM and service revenue was up sequentially and up double digits year-over-year. The decline in product revenue drove the overall reduction in our net revenue from Q4 as well as from Q1 last year.","NetApp branded revenue of $1.24 billion and OEM revenue of $209 million were each down slightly on a year-over-year basis. OEM revenue was up sequentially. However, the weak macro environment and FX impacted this revenue as well as our branded revenue, which was down 18% from Q4.","The effects of lower business volume was evident across all geographies in Q1 on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Asia Pacific remained a bright spot, with 9% year-over-year revenue growth.","Non-GAAP gross margins of 60.3% were as expected, up from Q4 and consistent with both the Q1 guidance and target range we discussed at our Analyst Day in June. Non-GAAP product gross margins of 51.4% reflect lower Q1 product volume as well as a mix influenced by slightly higher OEM revenues.","SEM and service margins were within their projected range, with a sequential increase in service margins due to a slightly higher concentration of hardware maintenance contracts.","Non-GAAP Q1 operating margins at 12.5% were higher than our guidance range due to lower operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up 6% from Q1 last year, but down 3% sequentially reflecting conservatism in spending across the business.","For Q2, though we expect a slightly higher spending level as annual employee merit increases take effect, we also expect to continue to maintain a level of conservatism in spending, given the overall business environment.","Our Q1 effective tax rate of 17.3% was in line with our expectations and is based on our most recent projections of our geographical distribution of revenue and profits.  Non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 was $0.03 over the high end of our prior guidance.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash and investments balance of $5.4 billion, an increase of $43 million from Q4. Days sales outstanding was equal to Q1 of FY '12, and inventory was up due to specific raw materials purchases we expect to utilize in the second quarter. Deferred revenue decreased by $48 million on a balance of approximately $2.8 billion, consistent with the lower business activity we expected for Q1. That said, deferred revenue was up just under $400 million from Q1 last year.","Cash from operations was $229 million for the quarter and free cash flow was 12% of revenue, up from 10% a year ago. Traditionally, Q1 is slow with respect to cash flow, as cash generation is offset by payments of Q4 variable and annual incentive compensation. Overall, cash flow was also reduced by $150 million as we repurchased just under 5 million shares of stock during the quarter.","Diluted share count decreased in Q1 by approximately 11 million shares due in large part to a lower average share price. The accounting for the shares associated with our convertible notes had a minimal impact of about 200,000 shares, and the warrants had no impact this quarter. As you may recall, 80% of the convertible notes are hedged. You can find a table on our website which shows the impact on diluted share count for a range of stock prices.","Turning to guidance, our target revenue range for Q2 is $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which at the midpoint, implies 7% sequential growth and 3% year-over-year growth. We expect consolidated, non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 60% to 61% and non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 13% to 14%. We expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 17.3%, bringing our non-GAAP EPS estimate to approximately $0.45 to $0.50 per share. With the full impact of the shares we bought back last quarter, diluted share count is projected to decrease to about 370 million shares in Q2 based on our average stock price of $32.44 for the first 10 days in the quarter. This will include about 700,000 shares from the convertible notes. Recall that the impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset, but does have a favorable impact on EPS.","So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Tom for his thoughts. Tom?","Thomas Georgens","Thanks, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, our business performed essentially as we expected. Despite our typically challenging Q1, macro and FX headwinds and generally longer sales cycles and smaller transactions, we delivered revenue at the midpoint of our guidance.","Recognizing the uncertain environment, the team demonstrated strong execution discipline in managing expenses, as well as generating a sequential increase in gross margin to produce better-than-expected operating margin and earnings per share.","Our APAC and U.S. Public Sector were the strongest geographies year-over-year. APAC grew 9% from Q1 a year ago. Business in APAC was mixed, with some countries turning in strong double-digit growth and others not performing as well.","In U.S. Public Sector, our state, local and higher-end businesses continues to be strong, but we continue to be affected by lower spending in other segments. After a strong performance in fiscal year '12, we experienced a decline in America's commercial and we continue to see softness in EMEA.","The biggest news of the quarter was the launch of our agile data infrastructure. NetApp's Data ONTAP, the market share leader among storage operating systems, has the industry's richest data management and storage efficiency capabilities. We have added to it, the architectural capability of clustering to deliver unprecedented levels of performance, scale and non-disruptive operations.","With around 125 customers over 10 petabytes, 4 over 100 petabytes and the largest approaching 1 exabyte, nobody has demonstrated the ability to manage data at scale like NetApp. Clustering further enhances our capability in this space. The performance and non-disruptive operations enabled by clustering will also allow us to participate in opportunities deeper in the data center, where previously, we may not have been considered.","With a storage architecture that can optimally host multiple disparate workloads and service level requirements, organizations can adapt in the face of unpredictable data growth and dynamic business demands with reduced complexity and cost.","Data ONTAP is the only operating system that enables customers to build an agile data infrastructure. The ONTAP family 8.1 has seen deployments triple this quarter as customers realize the value of our latest features. Our newest release, ONTAP 8.1.1 adds 4 key elements: Infinite volumes to support the needs of big data environments; flash pools to optimize performance for demanding workloads through the use of flash; bench shelves to meet the power space and cooling requirements of large data centers; and encrypted disk to address security-conscious applications.","Along with the rapid customer adoption and innovation in the 8.1 family, we are also seeing solid momentum with Cluster-Mode adoption. Cluster-Modes are up 40% from Q4 '12 on top of just over 60% sequential growth the prior quarter. Clustering is not just another feature. It is a new approach to storage infrastructure. Other clustering approaches have existed for a while, and are targeted at standalone niche workloads. NetApp's unique strategy is to mainstream clustering by combining it with superior data management functionality, enabling a single architecture to serve the demands of many workloads.","At this point, adoption is following several avenues. We have customers with an immediate need for performance and scale, others have targeted clustering for specific workloads, and finally, some who have fully accepted the vision of ONTAP 8 and have standardized on clustering for all the applications. In all of these customers, we see deployments ranging from pilot to full production.","We continue to aggressively pursue innovation in our flash strategy as well. We have consistently said that flash will be used at every layer of the stack, and NetApp will play at all of these levels. For flash and the storage array, we introduced Flash Pools in Q1, which gives customers the opportunity to optimize the use of solid state and hard disks to achieve the performance and available necessary for business-critical workloads.","At the controller level, NetApp has offered Flash Cache since 2009. We have seen strong adoption of Flash Cache, having sold over 17.5 petabytes of Flash storage accelerating over 1 exabyte of hard disk drives.","On the server side, our stated strategy is to partner with server flash hardware vendors and add value through software. Our recent announcement with Fusion-io is an example of execution against this strategy. You can expect to see more detail from us on this topic of host-based flash shortly.","Also in Q1, we introduced the FAS2220, our newest entry-level system building on the success of the recently introduced 2240. The fully refreshed FAS2000 family saw a 41% year-over-year increase in units shipped. The upper end of the 3000 family also grew from a year ago, but we saw an expected product mix shift at the boundary of the 2000 and 3000 product lines, resulting in an overall decline in 3000 units. The FAS6000 family and total V-Series units were consistent with Q1 of last year. Branded E-Series units are up significantly from its introduction a year ago.","The strength of the 2000 Series is reflective of our strong partner relationships. The 2000 family is key to the channel, and we are continuing to gain traction. The mix of direct and indirect channels remains steady from Q4 with 78% of revenue coming through the channels and OEMs. Together, Arrow and Avnet contributed 30% of our total revenue, consistent with last quarter and up 15% from a year ago.","The OEM contribution was 14% of total revenue. Our OEM business remains steady, slightly down from Q1 a year ago, but up 3% from Q4 of last year. And we continue to expand our OEM business and add new OEM partners.","We had another outstanding quarter with FlexPod, further enhancing our partnership with Cisco and our joint channel partners. Our FlexPod business grew almost 90% year-over-year. To date, we have almost 1,300 FlexPod customers and are seeing a clear ramp in repeat business. We are seeing strong traction across the board in all geos and verticals. The greatest demand for FlexPod comes from customers wanting to run mixed workloads. In Q1, NetApp and Cisco announced the launch of Premium Partner Framework, a global channel initiative to accelerate FlexPod momentum designed to deliver increased differentiation, streamline multi-vendor interactions and enhance profitability. We continue to strengthen our relationship with Cisco and are seeing the results of this strong partnership in the marketplace.","The value of our best-of-breed partnership strategy is playing out in customer environments. Our work with ING DIRECT, the world's largest direct savings bank, is an example of success of this approach. Developed collaboratively by NetApp, Cisco and Microsoft, working with a systems integrator and the customer, ING's Bank in a Box private cloud solution features Microsoft applications built on FlexPod. Using NetApp-specific and innovation, ING DIRECT was able to reduce test environment provisioning from 12 weeks to 10 minutes, dramatically improving developer productivity and business agility.","Overall, I remain confident in our strategy and our ability to grow our business and gain share over a multiyear period regardless of the macro environment. With the significant effort of integrating clustering with ONTAP functionality behind us, we now have a platform for accelerating innovation. The big breakthrough enabled by clustering is bringing the ONTAP feature set to a broader set of business applications that have seen little innovation from conventional storage solutions. NetApp is the only vendor that can unify structured and unstructured data at scale, which not only makes customers' information accessible, available, safe and cost-effective, but also empowers customers to use data to operate and transform their businesses.","The clustering capability, combined with the data management features, will preserve our leadership as we enable our customers to scale their business without limits.","At this point, I will open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kulbinder Garcha of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My question, I guess, for Tom is in previous, I guess, downturn, macro -- periods of macro uncertainty, you guys had always had the mantra of investing through it, and it did drive share gains. It sounds like you're being a bit more cautious right now. And I'm just wondering is that reflective of just the lack of visibility of the concerns you have as we go through this fiscal year, or is something else kind of going on then? On the -- my follow-up just for, Nick, on gross margin, as product gross margins reach, I think, new lows, can you just explain what's going on there? Is it a pricing dynamic, a mixed dynamic? Any kind of breakout there would be helpful.","Thomas Georgens","So first of all, I'll reiterate that I hope to have just one question each so we get through the entire list today. I think on the question of investing through it, the last time we went through this downturn, we actually did a restructuring. So we clearly actually cut back on expenses for a while. And we used that, frankly, to enable us to re-prioritize and invest in key priorities. So where we are, today, is that we've not done a restructuring as you can see from the numbers. But we are also investing in growth opportunities for us. So in terms of re-prioritizing our existing activities, that is aggressively going on. And in terms of specific near-term growth opportunities, whether it be channel programs or things of that like, we are still funding those. So we aren't in a total clampdown by any means, and certainly we aren't restructuring at this point in time. But clearly, we're trying to arrange our operating expenses towards what we believe is going to generate near-term growth. So there definitely is a re-prioritization going on. So I wouldn't want to give the message that we're purely hunkering down. We're clearly being conservative and we're clearly being careful, but we're trying to find a way to fund the things that are really going to make a difference.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Why don't I answer the question on gross margin as well. So we expected a range of gross margin for the quarter, Kulbinder, in the 60% to 61% range. And you can see on the results here, we fulfilled that, we came in at 60.3% overall. And if you look at the margins in the different categories of product, SEM and service, they were all pretty consistent with what we expected. So yes, the product gross margin is down from Q4 and that is a mix in volume type of driver that's causing that to happen. But that was in line with the expectations we had for the quarter.","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I mean clearly, the OEM mix and obviously the reduced absorption as a result of the lower revenue levels are factors there.","Operator","Our next question is from Aaron Rakers of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I appreciate in your supplemental information, you break out the branded and OEM piece of the revenue. But it would appear that, that includes both the SEM as well as the services piece. As we look at your competitive positioning, I think it would be helpful to try and understand beneath that, or specifically how that might break down between the product revenue. Any kind of color you can give on the growth rates for that, between, I think, what's disclosed as configured versus non-configured, or how you might just look at the product OEM revenue would be helpful.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. Not sure what the question was, but I appreciate the feedback, first of all. So I don't want to diminish like that. I think from the point of view, just to bear in mind that the OEM and branded is that both the OEM and the branded have both an E-Series and a traditional FAS component. Part of the rationale of doing it this way is particularly in some OEM accounts like IBM, which are both a FAS OEM and a branded OEM, we're somewhat less concerned about which product moves. Clearly, a year ago, prior to the acquisition, we had a clear preference for one over the other. So in this particular case, we're concerned about the overall health of our partners like IBM, as opposed to any individual product offering. It's probably safe to assume, I'll let Nick chime in on this, is that the SEM and the service component of the OEM business is a much more smaller percentage of the total revenue than it is on the branded side. In fact, overwhelmingly on the product side, it's in those businesses on the OEM front.","Nicholas R. Noviello","That's right. And I mean the OEM revenue that you can see here is basically flattish, right, from Q4. And we're looking at overall OEM now. So this is inclusive of the traditional N Series as well as the E-Series OEM that we've lapped a year of integration. We talked about breaking this into the 2 pieces. But we'll take your feedback and think about that supplemental commentary for the future. To Tom's point on the SEM and services side, OEM business really has very little of either one of those components.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Alexander of Raymond James.","Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just back to gross margin, the product margin was down 500 basis points year-over-year. Understanding product revenue is down 7%, and that's a big factor. Maybe if you can talk about how much of the year-over-year decline in gross margin was due to volume versus pricing versus mix. And how should we think about the trajectory of product gross margin specifically next quarter and over the next few quarters in the context of your 60% to 61% overall gross margin target?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes. So let me just start on that and I'll talk about the future here for a second. So when we look at that 60% to 61% for the second quarter, we're expecting in the range of about a consistency on the SEM side and consistency on the services side. So what that implies is because the mix also changes a bit as we go into second quarter, there'll be some increase on the product gross margin. So that is consistent. That is consistent actually, if you look backwards over a number of quarters, it's also consistent with a bit of a more richly configured mix as we go into second quarter each year. So that's how we think about the go-forward. The year-over-year is obviously impacted by OEM business. It's impacted by mix and really on both the customer side and the product side. Those are some of the main pieces that are going on versus last year.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I think the -- probably the other thing that's a factor here to some degree is I don't believe that drive pricing is completely normalized, and I think that that's reflected in this as well because in some cases, some of the drive pricing increases have not been passed along to customers. And as that sorts itself out, we certainly see drive pricing, at least the drive pricing behavior returning to kind of a more normal state. I think we still expect to see some upside on the gross margin from that perspective. And likewise, mix, basically the dramatic explosion of our low-end business, up 41% year-over-year is also a factor, including a key component of that is actually a product at the very, very low-end. So all of those factors continued, I think there are a number of things that are different. Clearly, pricing in the environment is non-trivial, teasing all of those apart and attributing them on a line item by line item basis is a little bit on the complicated side, but clearly something that we want to watch. But I do see upside capability both on drive pricing and on mix on utilization. And frankly, the impact of new products and the functionality we have on our product gross margin going forward in a favorable direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jayson Noland of Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to ask about FlexPod. Tom, do you expect to see any positive derivative benefit following the VMware acquisition of Nicira? Any impact from VisBox at EMC? We're hearing a lot about FlexPod in the field and just wanted to ask for more color.","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I think -- I certainly can't comment on Cisco's behavior relative to Nicira or even the Lenovo deal with EMC. What I do know is that we have a lot of momentum, and I think we've said from the beginning that as far as the partnership is concerned, I think the NetApp-Cisco partnership is one that's probably the most sustainable of them all. I think we are much better aligned from a product direction point of view and our belief of Ethernet base storage. I think we are much better aligned from a go-to-market perspective, and that we are very channel-centric. And I think that there isn't any fundamental strategic overlap or product overlap to create tension. So as a result, I think a lot of those things are working together for us, even independent of any actions by EMC. So clearly, that was one of the bright spots of the quarter. I think there's still a lot upside as we get more and more engagement on a worldwide basis, so we get to see more repeat purchases. So clearly, I think we're very, very pleased with that relationship, and it has a very, very large amount of momentum. I think that really the key message here is that technology is positioned against the server vendors. And the sever vendors value proposition is going to be one of integration, and it isn't to say that integration doesn't add value, but the customers are willing to sacrifice only so much innovation and product functionality in order to achieve that integration. And if we could go with another like-minded best-of-breed player like Cisco and integrate our technologies very, very tightly, then we can go in and basically nullify the integrations story and really talk about best-of-breed and the value that it brings to business. And I think the other key part of this story is really the integration with other partners. We were just awarded Microsoft's Partner -- Cloud Partner of the Year award, bringing Microsoft into FlexPod, likewise SAP and Citrix and Red Hat and really bring broader solutions around this platform. So I think from -- whether it be the partner ecosystem, whether it be the tighter integration and really the compatibility of our business models, clearly this has been a very, very strong story for us all year long and it continues into this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Milunovich of UBS.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Tom, following up on the Analyst Meeting, you talked about the Storage 5000, your protect and grow accounts. I assume you're not going to give us a quarter-by-quarter update on that, but it did seem to suggest improvement in both breadth and depth, which should lead to better revenue growth over time. How do you feel about that? Is the macro environment offsetting that? Are the sales cycles lengthening so much, or do you think that's going to play out over time?","Thomas Georgens","Yes, the -- obviously the numbers are pretty volatile from quarter-to-quarter. We still came off 3 very, very strong, new customer acquisition quarters to finish last year. We tend to start off slow because a lot of the Q4 activity is really around harvesting deals that we've been working on all year long. But that said, I think the new customer acquisition is what fuels the next generation of growth accounts for where the growth of the business comes from. So what we did see though is actually pretty good numbers on the channel side, And like I said, the Storage 5000 itself specifically, your question, was still very volatile. But the channel side new customer acquisition was still very good. Clearly, we see longer sales cycles. Clearly, other people are reporting that and we still see that as well. And I think that's one of the issues with some of the larger accounts because we're talking about much, much larger transactions and large transactions get a lot of scrutiny. But overall, I think that part of the engine of the business and our channel business, Arrow and Avnet, which are roughly 30% of our overall revenue, up 15% year-over-year. So I think the breadth of our channel and the expansion of our business and frankly, the channel partners that Cisco has helped us cultivate, and that relationship have all been very helpful. But the big enterprise accounts clearly launched transactions, certainly are getting a lot of scrutiny. Certain segments are clearly more problematic than others, but overall, within expectation. I think we certainly knew what to expect going in. We expected some of the large accounts to do very well, and the other ones to struggle, and clearly that's what we saw.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Marshall of ISI Group.","Brian Marshall - Gleacher & Company, Inc., Research Division","When you look at your bit shipments each quarter, if you look at the year-over-year numbers for the July quarter, the last 5 years, it's averaged kind of north to 60%, pretty consistently in terms of year-over-year revenue growth -- or year-over-year bit shipping growth. And this past quarter was obviously almost flat, at only up 4% year-over-year. So I guess the question becomes obviously, we're in a tough macro environment, but is there anything going on here? Clearly, we had a big deceleration with respect to bit shipments, and subsequently pricing, obviously, didn't decline as much as we historically saw. So I guess is there a kind of a -- sort of a different of dynamics that are kind of changing here for the company's business model? Love to get your viewpoint on there, what's going on.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I don't know if I'd overreact to 1 quarter in this environment. So I don't think there's anything fundamentally different going on. I still think that clearly, the drive situation had some impact on that as the year went on, as probably the normal cost curves. Certainly, the cost curves to us were different than in the prior years. And likewise, the cost curves to our customers are different than in prior years. So I think that there is a dynamic there. For NetApp, we saw a big pickup in our units at the low end, which clearly don't have as many disk drives, but they still carry a fair amount of other componentry in there. But the actual capacity numbers are a little bit less. On the other hand, when I look at some of our big consumer customers that consume a lot of product, they had pretty good quarters. So I think for now, I wouldn't read anything into the numbers, anything too much. Certainly, we are not. And we'll see how this goes on. But in a somewhat different environment, both from a cost perspective, from a macro perspective and a product mix perspective, I think we need to be careful of that of overreacting to 1 quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kurtz of Sterne Agee.","Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Tom, what's your current view on your acquisition strategy? And what markets are you thinking about, if any, to deploy your cash?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think the broader story around our acquisition strategy about we want to look to things that have got affinity to our core business that we can apply leverage to either something that our channels can sell or by virtue of having them in our portfolio, we can move more of our product. More broadly around, as we look at it, I think that just an ongoing cadence around smaller technology companies that we can tuck into our portfolio to either fill gaps or complete a solution or help us integrate with partners, I think we will continue to do that. And I think I said you'll probably see a little bit increasing rate of that as time goes on just as we get bigger proportional to our size. So I think that will continue. As far as larger transactions, those, I think, will be asynchronous and opportunistic. There's certainly no strategy change, but they will be a function of the fit, obviously, the price, the executability. And I think that those will be kind of opportunistic. If there's one available tomorrow, we'll move. If it's not available tomorrow, we won't. So I think what you'll see is probably more of a regular cadence around smaller technology companies and large deals that remain opportunistic. But the overall story that we talked abut in the last 2 Analyst Days, that we really aren't looking to just add components to the portfolio or even good assets. It really needs to be something that we can add leverage to, that -- something that we understand, we know how to sell and that we can add value and momentum to overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just have a question. When I think about the July quarter guidance you guys gave, it obviously had a lot conservatism built into it, which turns out to be the right thing. When I look at the October quarter guide of up 7.5%, it appears a lot closer to the historical seasonal patterns we have seen. Could you just talk about what enables you to feel better with the October quarter? Is it the macro getting better? Or are just getting better new wins given ONTAP 8.11 deployments right now?","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I think the macro assumptions, as you could well imagine, it's probably hard to find optimism on the macro front. I think just simply put, I think if you look at the macro front, EMEA is still a concern. I don't think it's necessarily deteriorated, but still there's a lot of uncertainty around the range of potential outcomes there. We have -- we're coming into the end of the U.S. fiscal year, and obviously, the election and the fiscal cliff at the end of the calendar year. My gut feeling is that this fiscal cliff will somehow get resolved and we'll work our way through it. I think the trajectory in the U.S. will be somewhat more of the same. And I think probably if there was new news since the last quarter, it's probably somewhat more negative headlines relative to the Asian economies, particularly the export economies. So as we look at it going forward, I don't think we're betting on any type of macro turnaround. I think we're looking at our product portfolio, we're looking at our partnerships, we're looking at our positioning in the field, obviously, the feedback from the field and putting that altogether. So from our perspective, I do believe that it's up from here. We -- and I think that our guidance from Q1 to Q2, admittedly after a reset of guidance for Q1, I think going back to normal seasonality, appears to be what we see.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes. Amit, it's Nick. Let me just add a couple of points to that. And we talked last quarter, overall about how do we forecast, and how we bring together this guidance. And it's a combination of a bottom-up look across all the geographies, across our channel business around the world, as well as a top-down look that incorporates things like foreign exchange and the macro. So we look at all of those pieces in bringing that together and that's what we've done here. The normal seasonality is one of the things we look at against that. I think on the macro side, as Tom said, it's pretty consistent there. And then on the FX side, when we look at foreign exchange from quarter-to-quarter, where we had degradation going on between April and the time we gave guidance at the end of May, at this point in time, it's kind of flattish as we look into the second quarter. So built in, again, those elements of the business from the bottom-up, FX and macro, maybe that gives you a little bit of sense of the pieces there that we brought together to come together with this guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Brean Murray.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","I guess just to piggyback off of that one, Tom, how was the linearity as you saw it through the quarter? And I guess, what have you seen so far this quarter, as well?","Thomas Georgens","Well, obviously it's early days; it's 2.5 weeks into this quarter. And I would say to kind of basically break our quarters down onto months is a little bit misleading. So I -- that would apply a bit more science than I think is really appropriate in the data. So I don't see anything dramatic. It wasn't like we blew out the early months and coasted in or the other way around. I would say it was pretty normal. So if the question is do we see a either positive or negative trajectory heading into this quarter, I would say it's probably still substantially unchanged. I would say there was probably nothing notable about our monthly cadence last quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray.","Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Tom, you noted strong early adoption of Cluster-Mode with a number of your customers. But can you comment on whether Cluster-Mode is actually getting you into some new verticals that perhaps you didn't have a large footprint in prior to 8.1 such as the telco or service provider verticals?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think in the service provider vertical, I think NetApp has been very, very strong. So on that particular one, I wouldn't give any ground. Clearly, I think if you look at 8.1 customers, there are some customers in our traditional spaces where they'll look at 8.1 and they'll see the performance capability and for those that are clamoring for performance, they'll jump on it right away. We have customers that have been in production on this technology for quite a long time, just full production launch clusters. And then I think that there are other people that are looking at this is technology, and they're targeting for specific workloads, and they're doing proof of concepts. So the ones that are going to deploy this technology and a lot of scale that have not used NetApp before will tend to go down the proof of concept route, and we certainly have a lot of that activity that's not yet reflected in the customer adoption numbers. And then there are customers out there that -- some of which are long-term NetApp customers, some of which are not, that are not sold on the clustering technology that made this a standard for all new workloads that they put online. So if I look up and down across the list, this isn't weighted by size of opportunity, but a fair amount of the Cluster-Mode wins that we have are, in fact, brand new customers to NetApp or, at the very least, brand new applications within existing customers to NetApp. So I'd say the ones that are in full production today that adopted the technology on day 1, those are the ones that are familiar with NetApp technology. The other ones are an interesting mix. The other thing that is probably a little bit different about this technology is that we've talked about clustering in the context of NAS for a long time. What this is bringing is clustering technology to SAN. And that has a very, very different technology and, as a result, it's generating a lot of interest. So this business probably has a little bit more activity on the SAN side than the pure NAS side than our core business simply because this is really an innovative technology. And not only is clustering in the SAN world innovative, it's all of the other features of ONTAP throughout the clustering in the SAN world that is innovative. And that's why we spoke at length at Analyst Day about the opportunity to open up a lot of new applications around workloads where we haven't previously considered because now we can marry that rich feature set of ONTAP, which doesn't exist in the SAN world, and we can marry that with clustering to deliver high performance and high availability. And I think that is really the exciting thing about all of this, and clearly we see those. But those types of big bets and big accounts usually start with proof of concepts, and that's what we have underway today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you talk about what the prepurchases were that drove the inventory up this quarter and whether that might set you up for better component pricing over the next couple of quarters?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes, Katy. I mean, there's a variety of things that go on there on the inventory side, including the new products that we introduced, right. That's going to drive some inventory. So really, this is a matter of looking across the components, across the entire spectrum and getting ourselves in position for all of that. I wouldn't go too far into the what will that do on the margin side, et cetera. That will all be built into our guidance. And our expectation is that, that inventory turns number will come up as we go through Q2 for sure and that inventory balance will come down.","Thomas Georgens","Likewise the -- obviously, we're operating off a lower COGS number this quarter because of the business level, so that clearly hurts the ratio as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian White, Topeka Capital.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Tom, when we think about the flash market, do you feel you have all the tools to address this opportunity? And how should we think about this new partnership with Fusion-io and what it means to NetApp?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think the market will evolve and time will tell how many tools are necessary. But I think as we see it now, we see flash on the host, we see flash on the array, we see flash in the storage containers, we see solid-state disks, and NetApp is going to participate on all of those. If there are other avenues of flash and deployments of flash beyond that, then clearly, we'll participate in those as well. But right now, if you look at our offering, our belief early on was that in the array products that flash deployed with a cache is the most effective way to deploy solid-state technology. And I think that we certainly stand by that today, and if anything, the industry has moved our way. Likewise, there will be flash on the host, and that's really what the Fusion-io discussion is about. And our view is that flash on the host, if it's going to be permanent storage, that's going to look like a disk drive to the application, then that needs to be brought into the broader data management capability. It needs to be backed up. It needs to be replicated. So our view is that flash on the host, that's going to fit this permanent storage type of model where it's going to look like disk drives, we want to do what it's going to take to bring that storage into our data management capability. So the opportunity for us is really around the software. So if we have to make and sell hardware in order to participate in that software opportunity, we will. And that's really what the Fusion-io relationship is about. And that is clearly they've got a strong presence there, it's an opportunity for us to partner, to bundle our software with their hardware to create a solution that enables broader data management as opposed to a one-off solution specifically for any individual host. So our -- we still believe that the opportunity there is really around selling software value-add and being a data management provider in the enterprise, and partnering with hardware vendors to enable us to do that allows us to leverage their presence and their technology and likewise our software differentiation. So you -- obviously, we hinted in the prepared text around some more announcements. So you'll actually see some specifics about that as opposed to a general technology collaboration. You'll see more specifics around that pretty soon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of JPMorgan.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Tom, your prepared remarks as well as your press release highlighted continued investment in the channel's been a really important part of your overall growth strategy for years. Just want to get a sense. Is the incremental investment being highlighted, is that really in response to competitive dynamics or just lack of maybe the direct sales force evolving as planned?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think it's -- well, it's more a response to opportunity. One of the things that we see in the channel is that the more we invest, the more we expand our coverage. There's opportunity out there. And it's a big, deep market. And so from our perspective, if I look at the work of Arrow and Avnet, which have become a very, very significant part of our business, and now they're still growing 15%, clearly they're -- clearly that market is far from saturated by NetApp. We don't appear to be coming to any limits, so the idea is that incremental investment there still will uncap market opportunity that we don't currently see. So there's pretty much -- I don't want to convey that there's any lack of confidence in our direct selling motion, it's just that in the channel, it's fast, there's a lot of customers, and even if some of them are slowing down, there are other ones that are speeding up. So the ability to basically touch more accounts, touch more opportunities in a leverage model is still a big opportunity for us. And that's just in the U.S. The ability to expand our coverage on a geographical basis outside of the U.S. is still a very, very large opportunity for us as well. We want to do that. Clearly, we need to do it in an effective way. We need to bring on credible partners that are going to invest alongside of us. But I still think that one of the biggest challenges not only for us, but for everybody in this market, is basically coverage and to reach as many customers as we can, that's why we continue to do that. So I don't want to blunt the competitive question. Clearly, in the aftermath of the breakup of the Dell relationship and EMC, clearly we see EMC in the channel, we see Dell in the channel. But we're not trying to invest to overpower those guys. I think our existing partners are doing just fine and we're looking to add more coverage to it.","Nicholas R. Noviello","The only other thing I'd add to that is when you look at the pathways mix and we talk about the pathways here, these are fulfillment channels. So our direct selling force is involved in many of these transactions that may ultimately get fulfilled through the channel. So that's just something probably to keep in mind with respect to direct versus channel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes of Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you guys talk a little about your -- in terms of your guidance what you're thinking about in the competitive environment? You talked about demand and whatnot, and your product revenue trends what the decline diverged from your largest competitor does. Your guidance imply that you guys, from a competitive standpoint, start growing like you had in the past, maybe in line to better than your competitors.","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think I'd go back to Nick's initial response. I think we take a look at the momentum of the business. We take a look at a bottoms-up analysis of the individual accounts. We look at the coverage map, the macro and those types of things. So I think that the competitive dynamic and who we compete against every day is going to stay the same. I don't see any player retreating. I don't see any player advancing. So I think we can assume the competitive dynamics and the product set and the vendor set are substantially the same. I think that part of this is, clearly, we refreshed the entry-level part of our product line. We've got very, very strong alliances now with Microsoft and Cisco and VMware. And I think there's a lot more for us to leverage there. We talked about some of these channel investments to expand our coverage. So I think with the -- assuming no change in the competitive landscape, I think that there's a number of leverageable opportunities. And I think we've advanced our own product set along the way, not to mention the release of 8.1.1, which had some new feature sets as well as clustering. So I think that our competitive position, certainly, is better than it was 3 to 6 months ago. And I also believe that our opportunity to expand our coverage is there as well. And that's what's fueling where we are, plus the pure bottoms-up of an account-by-account analysis, particularly around the major accounts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Shope of Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to dig into the Q1 performance, a bit more on the revenue line, if I could. It's certainly comforting that your overall revenue was in line with your expectations going into the quarter. But as Ben just stated, product revenue was down 7% year-over-year and 23% sequentially, and I think that's below most expectations out there. So could you dig into the dynamic a bit more on what you saw in terms of product demand throughout the quarter relative to your expectations? And looking at the competitive landscape, at least for the first quarter, do you think you were able to outgrow the market, or do you think that once we get all the numbers in, we'll see that the market was down 7% as well?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think in general, the items coming off the balance sheet are going to come off the balance sheet no matter what. And so, therefore, in order to have made the revenue number then, the performance of the product revenue had to be within our expectations because there really are no other knobs. So I think we ended up, more or less, what we said we were going to do. It's a little mix of the OEM business, which is primarily product revenue that will factor in that will modulate that a little bit. But for the most part, in order to get to the revenue number, then the products have to perform as we expected. As I look at the overall market and what will HP report, and what will Dell will report, and how it will all play out, it's kind of hard to separate their overall storage businesses from the individual lines of business particularly the way they present themselves. But I think it's probably safe to assume that our toughest quarter, Q1 -- I don't know how the rest of the industry is there, and I'm not going to make the claim that they're all going to perform at a growth rate that's less than what we did. The one thing to do, bear in mind is that this is our weakest quarter. Q1 is always our most challenging quarter, both from a market share perspective and from a comparison perspective. Certainly, historically, it's been the most difficult quarter for us to execute on. And the other thing that's probably a little bit different that's somewhat of a mitigating factor for NetApp is the areas where we've been historically strong like our VM business, and like our federal business, we're probably a little bit overexposed to those areas which are weaker then for the other guy. But nonetheless, I think, from a industry comparison perspective, I don't think that -- the numbers are the numbers and I don't think that we're going to claim that we outgrew the market or outgrew any individual products. It's a challenging quarter for us. It's always been in Q1, and we expect it to be up from here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Freed of Wunderlich Securities.","Brian Freed - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","I wanted to delve a little bit more into your flash pool technology. One of the gating factors in flash adoption has been the absence of a write cache. Can you, one, talk about how this positions you? What you think are the barriers to entry for other folks to develop a solid write cache? And also, what would be the potential impact on HDD in terms of how many you'd need in a flash pool implementation?","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I don't believe that the lack of write caching, particularly in the NetApp ONTAP architecture, the way we do it, consolidate and coalesce writes, which is different than anybody else, hence the Write Anywhere name, has been a significant barrier to our technology. I just don't. In fact, I can't think of a single situation that I personally have been involved in where that's been an issue. So I don't -- really don't think that that's a factor. I think the broader question of what having storage in the array does is it helps us with predictable performance, particularly in the fail over case because it eliminates some of the rewarming of the caches in case you have to fail over to another controller. So I think there's a number of ways where this helps us have better -- a bit easier to do than on the plug-in cards, and basically that our Flash Cache product. In addition, it allows us to put a lot more solid-state disk into a machine than you can do in the form of a plug-in card. In terms of the overall market and the impact of flash versus solid-state disks, one of the things that we've seen is a very, very small amount of flash can accelerate a very, very large number of solid-state disk, assuming that the algorithms by which the cache is loaded are very, very effective. I talked about we have 17.5 petabytes accelerating and exabyte of hard drives. So I think if the algorithms are effective and you can use the flash to the fullest, then 2 things: You can get rid of enterprise drives once and for all. You can go up to ATA drives on a pure basis. So if you can get your working set actively stored in flash, then if you can do that, then you don't need enterprise drives, you don't need storage sharing, you don't need any of that stuff. You just go to ATA drives on the back end. And then simply put, when you want the data, it needs to be fast, and when you don't want the data, it needs to be cheap. And I think that one of the strengths that NetApp has is the ability to very, very intelligently manage that cache. I think that's why we've been so successful with the Flash Cache product. Now there are some cases where the working sets are too big to put in that, in which case, I see a clear need for the solid-state disk, and likewise, the solid-state disk helps in high-performance high-availability workloads where the solid-state disk could be shared amongst many controllers. So I consider it to be an extension. It's not a departure. It's not a competitor of the Flash Cache. The other thing I should point out is that it's still a cache. And I think that, that is unquestionably the most effective way to deploy semiconductor memory because that way, it's always dynamic, it's always going to store your most active data, and that's the way to get the most price performance out of it. It allows you to best optimize price performance in your overall storage array.","Operator","Our final question comes from Rajesh Ghai of ThinkEquity.","Rajesh Ghai - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","I had a question on your down retention. Tom, you -- NetApp continues to be running consistently in the top, as far as the Great Companies to Work For, but does not seem to have helped you with talent retention. If you look at the new stories that are still emerging in the valley, a lot of them have significant number of NetApp engineers. Do you believe after all the attrition that you've seen over the past couple of years, you have the talent to drive your innovation agenda? And what are you trying to do that's different that could less those decline advertised headcount[ph]?","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I think it is obviously individual stories. But in overall attrition, this quarter, is not substantially different than attrition a year ago. In fact, it's effectively the same for all intents and purposes. So frankly, if you were going to start a storage company, who want would you to attract people from? It would be NetApp. So I think that there -- from some perspective, I think our record and our history, both in terms of the culture that we've developed and the performance of the company, makes us attractive. And people are going to try and draw our people away from NetApp. So I get that, and I'd rather be a net creator of talent and an exporter of talent than the other way around. And, in some cases, I think, that we are a natural target for those companies and with the right incentives and the right opportunity, it makes sense. I think around higher-level people, if that's what you're talking about, I think they all fall into different categories. We've had some people who've been here for a while, that have either retired or pursued CEO opportunities, or things that it's a last chance in their career to pursue, or the time is right in their career. They've done great work for NetApp and we wish them the best of luck in where they go. Other people haven't panned out and we've made changes. And there are other people that were great contributors here that saw an opportunity some place else. So I don't think that anything has really changed. We always regret to see good people leave. But we also appreciate the great work that they've done for us, and we certainly don't stand in the way of great opportunities. There some people that like idea of a startup that joined NetApp a long time ago and want to relive that. So that I'd say that say every case has a story. But in the aggregate, I'd say the current dynamics are not a whole lot different than they've been. So to answer your question, NetApp has been -- is a compelling culture. We spend a lot of time developing our people. So to specifically answer your question, I feel like we certainly have the team to succeed and prosper in this market and continue to outperform.","Kris Newton","All right.

This is my first earnings call as NetApp's CEO and it's an honor to be here.","We delivered revenue above the midpoint of our prior guidance with gross margin, operating margin and EPS all above our previous guidance ranges. We did what we said we would, but we're clear that we have a lot more work to do.","We're committed to helping our customers navigate their IT transformations to improving our own execution and to enhancing value for our shareholders. We're making progress against our plan, adding new customers and expanding the adoption of our portfolio by aggressively pivoting towards modern architectures such as scale out software defined flash, converged and hybrid cloud, all while planning to return to our operating models in the second half of this fiscal year.","This is my first time addressing many of you and what you'll hear from me today is the focus on portfolio management, execution and enhancing shareholder value. I want to start by sharing my views on how I think about managing our business and how we're shaping our strategy to respond to the transformation in the IT industry to increase efficiency and to deliver strong financial returns.","Then I'll provide an update on our business in the quarter and hand it over to Nick to cover our financial results before we open the call for Q&A.","In my first days as CEO, I spent time to ensure that we had a well articulated view of the industry transition and a clear understanding of customers, IT transformation priorities, but this alone is not enough. To maximize results from our strong portfolio of technologies we need to operate the business with a greater level of discipline and to align resources against our most important priorities.","In addition to improving alignment and inspection, you can expect from me highly disciplined portfolio management across all aspects of the business; technology, customers and go-to-market.","We must manage the business to drive efficiency and profitability from the mature parts of our portfolio so we can afford investment in emerging high growth areas to deliver innovation ahead of the market, drive increased awareness and expand our footprint.","You can expect to hear about the results of this rigorous portfolio management as we come back over successful quarters.","The requirement for digital capabilities and cloud-based solutions is driving fundamental change across the IT industry. Enterprises must transform in order to survive and data management is the heart of the transition they need to make.","Whether it's dealing with data growth efficiently, drawing real time insight from data or integrating data across their globally distributed value chain, managing data is of great importance to our customers. This is where NetApp has a profoundly important role to play.","We're the only company that can help customers manage their data seamlessly across multiple cloud architectures and provide the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth generated by the digital world. This is what I see as our big opportunity.","To accelerate this transformation, customers are seeking to take advantage of new applications and modern data center storage and data management architectures. This implies a reduced opportunity in the traditional storage market, but at the same time, growth in new areas such as scale out storage, software defined flash converged and hybrid cloud.","We are and will continue to actively drive a shift within our product and go-to-market portfolio to meet the changing demands of our customers and you will see me drive a more disciplined approach around managing this portfolio, both to increase focus on the growth and emerging parts of our business and to drive efficiency in the mature parts.","As customers transform their IT environments, they are reducing their spend on traditional storage, which has put pressure on our ONTAP 7-Mode business. The 7-Mode storage operating system was shipped in only 35% of FAS units in the quarter, down from roughly 75% a year ago.","Customers are also slowing investment in the capacity expansion of their traditional storage environments. Both of these dynamics lowered new unit shipments off and lower incremental capacity in ONTAP 7-Mode systems put downward pressure on our product revenue, despite strong growth in other parts of our business.","We've a heightened sense of urgency in working with our customers to enable their move to the modern architectures delivered by our portfolio. As customers replace their traditional storage architectures and transform their data centers, they want scale out and software defined storage functionality to both mange data growth efficiently and deliver service provider like flexibility.","Clustered Data ONTAP provides this through a highly efficient, multi-tenant, non-stop shared storage infrastructure to replace legacy stovepipe architectures for enterprise applications like databases, virtualization, VDI and eCommerce.","Clustered ONTAP also enables customers to seamlessly manage their applications and data across flash, disk and cloud footprints and as customers plan their hybrid cloud architectures the software-defined architecture of Clustered ONTAP provides a consistent way to manage data across private and public clouds regardless of underlying hardware.","Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 65% of the FAS systems shipped in Q1 up from roughly 25% a year ago. Unit shipments of Clustered ONTAP systems grew by approximately 115% the 13th consecutive quarter of triple digit growth. The value proposition of Clustered ONTAP for the next generation datacenter is strong as evidenced by continued rapid customer adoption.","We are migrating our installed based customers to Clustered ONTAP and gaining new customers in competitive environments. The number of customers using Clustered ONTAP grew by more than 130% in Q1 from Q1 a year ago. The fastest growth was in new to NetApp customers, which grew 225%.","Let me give you some examples to illustrate why new customers are choosing NetApp. We won the business of a mid-size Internet radio provider who had moved off a leading hyperscale cloud service provider due to cost and on to a solutions from one of the startups.","Ultimately that infrastructure could not scale to meet the customer's needs so they turned to Clustered ONTAP for its ability to spread the load across multiple controllers and for its virtual storage sharing capability, which efficiently priorities workloads.","At a multi-billion construction services company, we replace an established vendor. Clustered ONTAP was able to solve their problem with less hardware and greater flexibility.","In addition to buying new systems from us, the customer is also using our FlexArray software to run Clustered ONTAP on the un-depreciated hardware assets their now legacy vendor.","We told you last quarter that we\u2019ll make investments to accelerate the migrations of our customer's ONTAP 7-mode installed base to Clustered ONTAP and we have. Our transition programs offer customers and certified partners with transition support, temporary gear and financial incentives.","Just formalized in Q1 this program is already showing early results. A large semiconductor manufacturer in Asia Pacific building its private cloud and Clustered ONTAP leveraged the program to deploy a cluster of All Flash FAS systems, beating out flash offerings from established and emerging vendors and they plan to migrate additional 7-mode systems in the future to Clustered ONTAP.","A U.S. based multi-campus university is replacing its existing storage silos systems from NetApp and multiple competitors. They will standardize on Clustered ONTAP and OnCommand insight to provide services for all of their campuses and medical centers. Only NetApp could fulfill their performance archive and reporting needs.","Over the course of fiscal '16 we will continue to refine and expand our transition programs. Customers are seeking to gain competitive advantage and economic benefits from accelerating business transactions, processes and their supporting enterprise applications.","To do so they're deploying high-performance enterprise grade flash technology. Our All Flash FAS products offer built-in data protection, multi-protocol support, scale out performance and seamless data movement from flash, to disk, to cloud.","These benefits have driven rapid customer adoption of our All Flash FAS solution with unit shipments growing almost 140% year-on-year, the fifth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth.","In Q1 we launched new lower cost All Flash FAS products with flash essentials innovations to improve performance and efficiency. Customer reception to this launch has been tremendous and we saw a strong uptick in All-flash FAS sales momentum during the quarter.","We had significant and growing numbers of competitive wins against established and emerging flash-only vendors. For example at a major software-as-a-service provider, designing their next generation infrastructure to migrate from a traditional database architecture to an in-memory architecture, All-flash FAS beat solutions from both established and emerging flash only and hybrid flash competitors.","At a leading online retail financial services company with demanding mission-critical applications that monitor and analyze trading data throughout the day the EF series All-flash arrays easily outperformed all of the leading competitors.","To improve business insight and decision making, customers are also deploying new web scale and analytic applications like Hadoop and Splunk as well as increasing the amount of data that they retain online. To support the performance, availability and cost requirements of these applications customers are using our E series platforms.","As we aggressively target this part of the market, we see continued growth of the E series platforms with unit shipments up almost 50% from Q1 last year. To help with the additional transformation and to better manage their IT portfolio customers over the medium to long term are looking to enable hybrid cloud architectures.","The challenge of the hybrid cloud is that it is a series of isolated and incompatible data silos. Every cloud provider has a different way to manage data, making it difficult for customers to move and share data across clouds.","Our customers are looking for a consistent way to secure and manage data regardless of location and our focus on data management enables customers to utilize cloud resources while leveraging existing investments and maintaining control of their data.","Our hybrid cloud solutions are important in positioning us ahead of the market, but do not contribute meaningfully to revenue today. The products included in our hybrid cloud solution portfolio are NetApp private storage for cloud, Cloud ONTAP, StorageGRID Webscale and AltaVault.","Of these, NetApp private storage represents the largest opportunity. It enables customers to take advantage of the elastic compute resources of multiple clouds for cloud bursting or data analytics while maintaining complete control of their data. Cloud ONTAP is a rent by the hour version of Clustered Data ONTAP available on Amazon web services for used cases such as agile software development.","The number of hours of usage continues to grow nicely with hours of usage more than doubling from last quarter.","AltaVault is the most recent addition to this part of our portfolio. It helps customers preserve the investments in their existing backup software while enabling them to take advantage of low cost cloud storage as a long-term back-up and archival target. In Q1, we announced new AltaVault solutions and extended service offerings.","Our hybrid cloud portfolio is delivering strategic wins. We've had several NetApp private storage wins at companies with strong cloud mandates because it enables them to leverage cloud resources while avoiding data governance risk and data mobility challenges.","We gained a foothold in a new financial services customer with AltaVault displacing our leading competitor's Legacy Backup Solutions because of our ability to unlock the economics of cloud for backup.","With StorageGRID Webscale, we beat established and emerging vendors at a photo sharing cloud provider because it enabled the customer to leverage their existing infrastructure while moving to object storage for data management at Webscale.","Finally, customers are looking for pre-integrated converged solutions. Today NetApp offers the highly successful FlexPod converged system in conjunction with Cisco. You can expect to see exciting innovations on FlexPod this year.","We recently began shipping NetApp integrated EVO:RAIL Solutions bringing the proven benefits of NetApp storage for VMware to hyper converged form factor. We will continue to monitor the evolution of hyper converged infrastructure.","As we move to better address the growth areas of the storage market, our confidence in our direction comes from our customers. Our strategy and technology portfolio resonate with enterprises and service providers positioning us as a strategic advisor to assist them through their IT and digital transformations.","As I've said elements of our technology portfolio are growing rapidly. We're shifting investments in our go-to-market teams to accelerate that growth and those actions are showing early signs of success. We added incremental sales headcount in Q4 of last year and the beginning of this year and they're already driving meaningful expansion to our pipeline.","We also took action to regain traction in our channel. We added a Global Channel Chief, a worldwide channel leadership team and made investments in channel marketing programs, all by reallocating resources within our operating expense envelope.","I personally have met with partners in the Americas and EMEA and have seen their excitement over the opportunity with NetApp.","Be clear that we have a sense of urgency and a high level of focus to ensure that our investments continue to translate into productive sales conversations and ultimately pipeline and bookings growth.","We expect that investments in Clustered ONTAP transitions, sales capacity and channel traction, combined with our shift to better address the industry trends will deliver improving results over the course of this fiscal year and we're committed to returning to our target operating model in the second half.","We continue to work through the declines in the mature part of our business, but are encouraged by the many areas of growth.","Before I had it over to Nick to go over the quarter in more detail, I would like to summarize by saying, our strategy is to assist our customer's IT transformation with a unique and differentiated vision for data management.","We plan to deliver against this vision by actively pivoting the company to execute against the industry trends of scale out, software defined storage flash, converged infrastructure and hybrid cloud data management and at the same time, we have an intense focus on disciplined cost management and cost structure.","We are confident that we're on the right path, but clearly have more work to do. I will focus on driving disciplined portfolio management, streamline decision making for efficiency alignment and accountability and instill more rigorous inspection and corrective action for high performance execution.","As I continue my rigorous analysis of the business, these plus understanding our customer's plans to consume technology are all considerations that I'll take into account as we position the company for success and increase shareholder value.","On our next quarterly earnings call, I'll have more details to share with you. I am excited for the future. The feedback from our customers on our technology and strategic direction has been strongly positive.","Partners feel confident that our portfolio provides a unique value proposition for them and their customers and by raising the bar on our execution and actively addressing the industry trends, we will emerge from this transition a stronger, more focused and disciplined company.","I'll now pass it over to Nick.","Nick Noviello","Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us.","NetApp delivered Q1 results that were generally on track and in line with our expectations. As George highlighted, the storage industry is in transition as customers drive IT transformations to take advantage of new technologies and architectures, while planning their journey to the hybrid cloud.","As you know, this industry transition has impacted our business as well. We've embarked on a new chapter and we're aggressively shifting our efforts to better position ourselves for the future. We saw progress on many fronts in Q1, but we still have a lot of work ahead.","For the first half of fiscal year 2016, we're raising the bar on execution across all aspects of the business. For the second half of the year, you can expect us to deliver against our plan and return to our target operating margins. Beyond fiscal 2016 we will do a much better job demonstrating our broad value proposition to customers and translating that to financial results top and bottom line and increased shareholder value.","Please note that I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s presentation unless otherwise indicated. Fiscal Q1 net revenues were $1.34 billion down about 13% sequentially and down 10% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact of about four points on the year-over-year comparison.","We estimate that the extra week in Q1 which occurs every six years to realign fiscal and calendar months added approximately $40 million of revenue to the quarter. Product revenue was $664 million in the first quarter, down 27% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact on the year-over-year product revenue comparison by about five points.","The decline in product revenue due largely to the decline in ONTAP 7-Mode sales was in line with our expectations and prior guidance.","The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues primarily comprised of existing, new and renewed service contracts was $671 million in the first quarter up 7% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year.","The increase reflects the continued growth of installed base and short term renewals from existing customers as well as the benefit from the extra week in Q1. In direct revenue through the channels and OEMs was 77% of Q1 net revenues compared to 78% in Q4 and 76% in Q1 of last year.","Gross margin of 63.6% was down just under a point from Q1 last year and was negatively impacted by about a point from FX consistent with our prior expectations. Product gross margin was 51.2% reflecting a decline of about six points year-over-year. Roughly half of this decline was due to FX headwinds with the remainder from lower volume, unfavorable product mix and some higher discounting.","Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up just under a point and half reflecting increased revenue and leverage of existing infrastructure investments and the benefit of the 14th week.","Operating expenses of $746 million were up 3% year-over-year. FX reduced operating expenses by about four points on a year-over-year basis and consistent with my comments last quarter the 14th week contributed about $41 million of sequential growth.","Operating margin of 7.7% was above our previous guidance range driven by lower spending and the benefit of our previously announced realignment action on largely inline revenues and gross margins.","Our realignment actions resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 3% and a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $27 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter and projected rate for the year was 17% up half a point from Q1 last year due to greater investment income in our foreign subsidiaries taxed at U.S. rates.","Q1 weighted average diluted share count of 308 million shares decreased by approximately five million shares sequentially due to share repurchase activity in the quarter. EPS was $0.29, $0.04 over the high end of our prior guidance range driven by higher operating margin and lower diluted share count.","Now turning to cash and balance sheet metrics, we closed Q1 with $5 billion in cash and short term investments, approximately 8% of which was held by our domestic entities. Inventory turns decreased to 10 due in part to our factory move, which is now complete.","I anticipate inventory turns returning to a normalized mid to high teens level in Q2 and in fact much of the additional inventory we built up during Q1 has already been shipped.","Q1 day sales outstanding decreased to 30 days due to invoicing occurring earlier in the quarter and an extra week of collections from the 14th week.","Deferred revenue decreased by $131 million in Q1 versus Q4 and decreased $10 million from Q1 last year. We expected the decline, about $40 million of which was due to the 14th week and the remainder commensurate with the decline in product revenue.","Q1 cash from operations was approximately $129 million versus $216 million in Q1 a year ago. At 7% of revenue, free cash flow was down as expected due to lower net income resulting from the year-over-year revenue decline.","We repurchased approximately $430 million of our stock and paid $54 million in cash dividends during the quarter. As you may recall, Board of Directors authorized $2.5 billion of repurchases by the end of May 2018 with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016.","Today we announced our next cash dividend of $0.18 per share of the company's stock that will be paid on October 21, 2015.","Now I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our business outlook and guidance. As I discussed earlier, fiscal year 2016 is one of transition. We're aggressively focused on our top priorities, rebuilding pipeline and momentum in the first half of the year and executing against our plan to return to our targeted operating model for the second half of the year.","We've a strong portfolio of technologies booked into a better job of fully monetizing it. With George at the helm, we're doing a deeper dive to understand our business and market opportunity beyond this fiscal year. You can expect to hear from us on our next quarterly earnings call with a further update on how we expect to evolve the business to deliver greater value to customers and shareholders.","For fiscal 2016, we now expect revenue to be down about 5% with impact from FX headwinds and limited topline predictability in the first half of the year easing in the second half. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth and our continued actions to drive down cost, we expect fiscal 2016 gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about one point from fiscal 2015.","We expect operating margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about two points for the year with a challenging first half and a return to our 18% to 20% target operating margin range for the second half.","Although off to a slow start in the first quarter, we expect a year of continued cash flow generation with free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for the year in the mid teens.","Finally we remain committed to driving shareholder value through share repurchases and dividends. Based on current stock prices, we expect to reduce share count in fiscal 2016 by approximately 5% and between dividends and share repurchases, we will again return over 100% of free cash flow generated to shareholders in fiscal 2016.","For Q2 we expect continued FX headwinds and limited topline predictability as we rebuild pipeline and momentum. As such, we expect net revenues for Q2 to range between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, which at the midpoint implies a sequential increase of approximately 9% and a 6% decrease year-over-year.","We expect Q2 consolidated gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5% and operating margins of approximately 14% to 15%. Based on our share repurchases in Q1 and in the first 10 days of Q2, we expect our diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 303 million shares and earnings per share for Q2 to range from approximately $0.55 to $0.60 per share.","In summary, we're confident in our differentiated strategy for data management in hybrid cloud. We're shifting our investments and efforts to accelerate growth in the areas of our portfolio that address our customer's most pressing IT imperatives.","FY'16 is a year of transition as we rebuild our pipeline, help customers through their IT transition and return the business to our targeted operating model. The positive feedback we've received from customers and partners reinforce our confidence in our directions.","Last but not least, I\u2019m excited about the change that George, brings as a CEO of NetApp. I believe his focus on portfolio management, execution, and shareholder value combined with his perspective and frank assessment of the entirety of our business will yield positive results for partners, customers and shareholders.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kris to open it up for questions and answers. Kris?","Kris Newton","We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. And congrats George on a nice start to the job. I guess my question really is when you think about the initiatives and the execution improvement you\u2019re talking about, how do you think about -- is there room for cost curtailment as you go forward, because even if I take the assumptions for fiscal '16, you'll probably exit the year with low single-digit revenue growth in a good scenario.","In that case do you think 45%, 50% of sales going to expenses is a reasonable target for a company to have or do you think there is room for that to lower and if so, what are the levers or what are the metrics you could do to lower that operating expense structure?","George Kurian","We have been and continue to be disciplined around the cost structure of the company. I think if you look into our plans for this fiscal year, there are already expense containment strategies in place that improve the target operating model of the company back to our guidance range within the second half of the year.","So we have plans already in place. I continue to inspect them and I\u2019m also rigorous that we align the resources of the company against the biggest opportunities and harvest the mature parts of our portfolio for profit.","In addition both Nick and I are studying the evolution of the storage market and we\u2019ll have a broader perspective to you about the operating structure of the company as well as the way to maximize both the return on our assets as well as shareholder value at our next earnings call.","Nick Noviello","Hey Amit it\u2019s Nick as well, let me just get real granular for a second. If I look on a year-over-year perspective or first half to second half perspective, I would expect that the expenses of the company, the operating expenses would be down in the second half of the year. So we have operating plans and we\u2019re operating against all of those plans across the functions to achieve just that.","We also have the additional levers of gross margin that you can imagine we always look at. We always look at our spending there. We always look at our structure on that side, work for suppliers etcetera and then even to go further up the stack the value we get out of our software value proposition.","Kris Newton","Thanks Amit. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi thanks. I just wanted to get a sense from you George. On the last call we heard a lot about customers waiting to transition to Clustered ONTAP, I want to understand what change this quarter and what makes you confident in the growth for the next quarter? You're guiding to up 9%. What are you seeing that\u2019s making you confident about that? Thank you.","George Kurian","The growth that we see is from both the investments in sales capacity translating to pipeline expansion and is a combination of customer acquisitions and usage of Clustered Data ONTAP for new workloads within existing customers.","The pace of transitions from 7-Mode to Clustered ONTAP within our install base will be benefited from the work that we\u2019re doing to make it easier for customers to transition but will be prioritized against their broader landscape of IT priorities.","So we are by no means counting on just installed base transitions to drive growth. We\u2019re counting on the pipeline expansion and the capacity investment that we\u2019re making to drive that upside.","Kris Newton","Thanks Sherri. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz of Sterne Agee. Your line is now open.","Alex Kurtz","Yeah thanks for taking the question guys. Nick, just on the product margin in the quarter, it sounds like maybe FX had some impact here, but this is one of the lowest prints you put up in a while. Was there mix issues there or were there any component issues.","And as you look at the second half statements you\u2019re making on operating leverage so what is your expectation for product mark and recovery as we get into Q3 and Q4?","Nick Noviello","Yeah. Thanks Alex. So just to be clear so on that product gross margin for Q1 versus Q1 a year ago, yes it was a pretty significant decline in gross margin percentage. Half of that was FX all by itself okay.","So you're seeing that FX really hitting the product side of the fence versus the deferred side of the fence. In addition to that, it\u2019s a combination of volume and mix which you would expect given the rebuild of the pipeline and some discounting.","So we talked about discounting last quarter. We talked about again discounting this quarter. I indicated that I would talk about that to the degree that it changes on a year-over-year basis. So you can imagine with a lower pipeline and a need to rebuild those are the types of things we have to work through.","Over the course of the year in terms of product gross margin, we\u2019re going to expect that FX certainly fades in the back half of the year. We shouldn\u2019t have assuming there is not another dramatic change out there, we shouldn\u2019t have the type of compares we\u2019ve had.","So we\u2019ll back to the typical which is looking at the mix of business. We'll be looking at the combination of pricing, discounting and savings of the supply chain to really look at the gross margin there. So that\u2019s probably the good perspective for you.","Alex Kurtz","All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Katy Huberty","Yes, thanks as it relates to hitting the target model in the back half of the year, can you get there with the current booked maintenance and cost cuts and the gross margin acceleration that you\u2019ve talked about already? Would you need the product revenue to grow again in the back half to hit the target? Thank you.","Nick Noviello","Yes Katy, let me start on that and if George has a perspective he can weigh in as well. Remember the first half of this year was about pipeline rebuild. We\u2019re talking about pipeline rebuilds from a perspective of rebuilding sales capacity, of channel investments, of C-DOT transition programs and we\u2019re seeing the beginning of those things.","So in terms of the back half of the year, what we expected to happen and what we\u2019re seeing the early -- the green shoots on if you will, those metrics are coming in and they\u2019re starting to build and we expect to monetize some of that in the second half.","Is it a dramatic shift of product revenue from the second quarter, let\u2019s say to the third or the fourth, I wouldn\u2019t call it a dramatic shift. Certainly the first quarter was impaired and we knew that coming into the first quarter.","The maintenance streams of the company, we can look at those year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter and that's reflective of that installed base. The installed base as we indicated continues to grow. It\u2019s a combination of new renewal and that and we see that -- sometimes we see that in short terms. Sometimes we see that in longer term thesis.","So is there a dramatic shift from the second quarter to the second half of the year, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a dramatic shift. Obviously we expect some uptick in terms of product revenue. We will no longer hopefully have the FX pressure on product revenue, but certainly Q1 was a low point and Q1 was reflective of what happened to the pipeline and Q1 is really the area where we\u2019re going to be the lowest.","Katy Huberty","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Alexander of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Brian Alexander","Yes just following on to that, the revenue guidance up 5% to 12% sequentially Nick is the most growth you\u2019ve guided to for a July quarter in many years. So can you just talk about your confidence level and the key drivers of what appears to be an above seasonal growth outlook and specifically how should we think about on a sequential basis, the product revenue versus software and services? Thanks.","Nick Noviello","Well if you\u2019re talking about a sequential basis from Q1 to Q2 obviously there is going to be an uptick we expect on the product revenue side. That is a granular build up we do of pipeline and a granular build-up we do of our expectations for the quarter.","Obviously the -- what comes in off the balance sheet on the software and hardware components, we know very, very well. So there is a sequential increase on the product revenue side of a sense in Q2 that's reflective of some of that pipeline that started to build up, started to build in the metrics there.","It is a pretty significant increase quarter-over-quarter sequentially. So a year from now I will be reminding you of that but that is built on our bottom up projection of the business.","Brian Alexander","Do you still expect software and service revenue to grow double-digits on a year-over-year basis in the October quarter?","Nick Noviello","I would not. Okay. They come in off the balance sheet I would\u2026","Kris Newton","All right. Thank you, Brian.","Brian Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Again Jayson Noland of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Kris Newton","All right. Let\u2019s move on to the next caller.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is now open.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you. Could you talk a bit more about the transition to ONTAP 8 from 7? You gave us some percentages that you haven't given before. It sounds like there is a pretty significant shift toward 8, but you didn\u2019t give us any kind of sequential percentages?","So was that really accelerating at this point and anyway now it seems to have accelerated obviously the total number has gone down and I guess that plays to your comment about just people transactionally holding back right now.","George Kurian","I think at the highest level when we talked about percentages, we talked about the percentages of FAS shipments and we said that the 7-Mode systems were down to 20% to 35% of FAS shipments from 75% year ago and the clustered ONTAP 8 version are up to 65% of FAS shipments from 35% -- from 25% a year ago.","So there is a dramatic growth in clustered ONTAP systems as a percentage of our total mix as well as just year-on-year and it represents the value propositions of Clustered ONTAP.","Those include shipments being made to new customers, new workloads within existing customers and as we mentioned some early benefit from the transition programs that are under installed base.","I would say that on the last bucket meaning the transitions were still very early in that program it seems some good momentum and confidence building within our customers, but hasn\u2019t materially translated into results yet. ","Steve Milunovich","Thanks.","Kris Newton","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Louis Miscioscia of CLSA. Your line is now open.","Louis Miscioscia","Okay, great. May be I'll go back to Brian\u2019s question, it looks like most of the etcetera week fell into software entitlement and also services. So how much would we expect those to be down on a quarter-to-quarter basis or do you expect them to be flat, which will help us think about how we should also then model in the product revenue? Thank you.","Nick Noviello","Yes Lou, I\u2019m not going to get into a granular level of specific there, but really the $40 million of the 14th week was in software and was in the service revenue lines.","So it's all there and in fact you can see it on the deferred revenue side of the fence. So deferred revenue was down pretty substantially in Q1 on a year-over-year basis and we haven\u2019t seen that kind of decline really in quite some time.","If you take $40 million out of that, which is a deferred component, you get back to a number of that, we\u2019re not thrilled about, but that's a lot closer to those types of sequential decline we\u2019ve seen before.","So what we expect to happen is obviously that 14th week doesn\u2019t occur again in Q2. We go back to a 13th week. We won\u2019t talk about 14th week again for six more years from now. So we\u2019re going to look at those pieces.","It obviously means that the amount of revenue of $40 million was shared between software and hardware and the share was 18 and 25 respectively that's not going to occur again in Q2.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks Lou.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Aaron Rakers","Yes thanks for taking the question. Just on clear and will go back to Brian\u2019s question and I think the prior question as well, at what point does the decline in deferred catch up with the software entitlement maintenance and if you do expect that to decline or not grow the double-digit rate it seems to imply a fairly high teens if not 20% sequential growth in product revenue after the first quarter.","So I\u2019m just curious of how we should expect the deferred revenue trends? Should we expect that to grow going forward and what that implies for the product revenue in the first quarter?","George Kurian","Okay. So if I think about deferred the software entitlements and service revenue, on a year-over-year basis in Q2, I would expect those things to go up and not going to go up dramatically, they are not going to be reflective of 14th week because there will be no such things. Okay.","On the product revenue side and I think the real question is what's going to happen with product revenue? On a sequential basis, we expected a pretty reasonable increase in product revenue. Why is that? That is because at the time we came to the end of Q4 we did not have a pipeline on the product revenue side and we had to rebuild that pipeline.","What we're seeing and what we're doing as we build up the guidance for Q2 is that we're going to see some return on the product revenue side and that's reflected in the guidance that we pulled out there.","Aaron Rakers","Thank you.","George Kurian","Hey, Aaron as you know, we don't guide below the overall revenue line third quarter.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open.","Brent Bracelin","Thank you. George wanted to go back to kind of the decision here to kind of pivot to these modern data architectures. The question is how quickly can you pivot and will that include divestitures or acquisitions and the reason why I ask obviously C-DOT has been years in the making.","So help us understand your appetite, how quickly can you pivot here and will that include divestitures or acquisitions?","George Kurian","First of all, I think we have a strong portfolio of technologies that are relevant to the modern architectures within our customers. In some cases it is developing core technology. In other cases it is qualifying our technology for emerging used cases within our customers because solutions development.","I think that is all well underway and we feel good about the portfolio we have. We're also constantly looking at the evolution of our customers perspective on the IT landscape, their requirements for data management and we'll always be on the lookout for M&A tuck-ins where they make sense have strategic fit, have the right financial criteria associated with them and we have a disciplined way of scanning the landscape and discussing with our customers their choices ahead of them and for us.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks Brent. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Rod Hall","Yes, hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one, which is could you give us -- you gave us all the year-over-year trajectory on Clustered ONTAP, but would you be able to give us the proportion of the install base that has adopted it just to give us some idea where we are, where we're tracking?","George Kurian","We're as a percentage of our install base, we're about 15% of the total install base and remember the install base is growing and last quarter we were at 11% of the install base. So pretty good sequential growth.","Rod Hall","Great. Okay. Thank you, George.","Kris Newton","Thanks Rod.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Maynard Um","Hi thanks. Nick you talked about next quarter being based on a bottoms-up basis. Can you just talk about how much of that is based on fiscal year government spending or what your expectation is there?","And then George if you could just talk about -- you talked about making sure to understand customer mindsets and if they're changing. Wondering if you are seeing any changes within your customer mindsets since you bring that up, thanks?","George Kurian","Okay. So Maynard, why don't I just get started. So second quarter is when we generally see the Government, the U.S. Government I should tick in. So our bottom up includes our expectations from the U.S. Fed. It includes our view of contracts that are taking shorter, longer or sideways in terms of the time to land them.","As you know we have a very strong presence there and a very good business condition overall and value proposition for them. So the second quarter will include U.S. public sector element to it, a federal fiscal yearend element to it. We plan on all of those. We look at risks or opportunities to those as we build that bottom-up guidance.","Nick Noviello","I think to answer your question in terms of the discussions we have with our customers, I've actually had several meetings with customers from all different parts of the world and I am just headed out to Asia Pacific as well.","I think the things that encourage me are the breadth of discussions we have and the adoption of multiple products in our portfolio by the enterprise customers that we work with. I think they are expanding the range of things they're doing with us and we're excited and encouraged.","Strong growth in terms of the number of customers, enterprises buying multiple products from us for broad set of used cases.","Kris Newton","Thanks Maynard.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Your line is now open.","Nehal Chokshi","Thank you. What has been the capsulate of new workload across to market with Clustered ONTAP over the past year. It seems like it\u2019s been depressed and I think you've talked about being refill that pipeline? Is that a fair way of looking at that?","George Kurian","I would say that if you were to look at two dimensions of new workloads being captured, I think the first one is new to NetApp customer where clustered Data ONTAP has given us a footprint that we didn\u2019t have before.","And as we said in our commentary that has seen strong growth up triple-digits 225%, and so that\u2019s a measure of competitiveness of Clustered ONTAP in net new to NetApp environments.","Within existing NetApp customers, the preponderant majority of Clustered ONTAP sales have been to new footprints. As we mentioned the percentage of our installed base that has migrated from their legacy 7-Mode environments to Clustered ONTAP has been small.","Nehal Chokshi","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks Nehal.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much and congratulations both George and Nick. First I've a question for George and a easy clarification for Nick. George you talked about stay tuned to many things you\u2019re looking at for the next quarter, can you help us understand these many things?","Are they more operational focused? Are they more capital allocation deployment focused that we might ask is I\u2019m sure you are aware of where your stock price is and your strength of your company?","And so one could beg hey why not even buyback more stock, but one could also say maybe we\u2019d spend that more for strategic acquisitions or maybe some different go to market strategy or something like that. So if you can help us understand what\u2019s exactly you're looking for stay tuned.","And then for Nick, can you just help us understand you guided for I think was 3 or 3 million in shares, does that include the share count today than what you buyback so far this month or does that also include your estimated stock buyback that you will do after today\u2019s call?","George Kurian","So let me answer first the perspective I\u2019m taking is a broad perspective looking at all aspects of the business, both the operating model of the company as well as the opportunity to optimize our capital structure to maximize returns to shareholders.","Nick Noviello","Okay. And then my quick clarification on the 303, this is what we\u2019ve done based on the first 10 days of the quarter. So we have not in the past and don't in the future plan to project out what we'll by over the quarter is really based upon first 10 days what happened last quarter and how that falls and depend really just the first 10 days of volume.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Jim.","Jim Suva","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street Capital. Your line is now open.","Eric Martinuzzi","Thanks. I was hoping you could comment on the international aspects of your business just as you\u2019ve re-built the pipeline exiting Q1 pockets of strength in the international EMEA APAC rest of the world if you could comment that I\u2019ll appreciate it?","George Kurian","We\u2019ve had a strong start to the year in the European theater with all of our parts of Europe doing very well year-on-year both especially with FX being accounted for. So that\u2019s a reflection of both the Leadership Team in Europe as well as the value proposition for Clustered ONTAP.","Some of the key features that our European customers were waiting for were made available to them in 8.3 and that is now translating into results from the capacity investments as well as the product readiness.","Within APAC, we continue to monitor the situation in China. Of course our China business is a small business and hasn\u2019t been affected by the changes in China, but we\u2019re evaluating the impact of the Chinese economy for the rest of the Asia Pacific Theater.","Kris Newton","Thanks Eric.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Andrew Nowinski","All right. Thanks you mentioned pretty strong growth out of your genuine pipeline this quarter, just curious of your thoughts regarding the acquisition stock here last night, you're normally competing against one of your largest suppliers DA?","George Kurian","The focus for our E series business is on the branded customer business and it is about building pathways to market through our more traditional routes to market resellers, system integrators and service providers.","I think we feel good about the progress we\u2019ve made. We think we feel good about the relationships that we have with enterprise and service provider customers who look to buy directly from us or through our reseller model and so we feel that the acquisition does not materially affect that business.","Kris Newton","Thanks Andy.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Srini Nandury of Summit Research. Your line is now open.","Srini Nandury","All right. Thank you for taking my call. Congratulations on a good quarter. I had a question on the Clustered ONTAP adoption within your install base. Are they -- when you sell into your install base, are they going to the net new workloads or are they going to your existing workloads? Or in another words are people replacing the old 7-Mode and putting the new boxes in?","George Kurian","When we look at that right, so there is sort of two or three sets of used cases within our existing customers. One is competitive displacement or new workload growth. We're certainly seeing a strong set of trajectory around that.","The second is replacing 7-Mode for a workload that could have run on 7-Mode, where they choose to go to a new architecture. That certainly happens as part of footprint and then the percentage of those where you have a workload that is running on an old 7-Mode system that now gets essentially upgraded and converted to a Clustered ONTAP system, the last one is a small percentage of the total.","Kris Newton","Thanks Srini.","Srini Nandury","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I'll hand the call back over to NetApp for any further remarks.","George Kurian","Thank you. I would like to conclude by saying I am excited and honored to lead NetApp through the industry transition. I want to extend my thanks to the entire NetApp team for your hard work and for your support as we create opportunity for NetApp during this transition.","We're taking action to better address the trends in the storage market and will manage our portfolio of solutions to target the requirements created by those trends. Our strategy resonates with partners, enterprises and service providers and we're making investments to ensure we're engaging in more customer conversations an opportunities.","Those investments are yielding results that position us for a successful future, but we have more work ahead of us. We're committed to enhancing shareholder value and plan to return to our target operating model in the second half of this fiscal year.","Our focus on cost structure, stock buyback program and dividends are important demonstrations to this commitment and to our confidence in our future.

Ms. O'Boyle, you may begin.","Shauna O\u2019Boyle","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are our CEO, Tom Georgens; and our CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, the supplemental commentary, our financial tables and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections, including our financial outlook for Q1, future product offerings, expected benefits of partnerships, alliances and product introductions, our ability to procure sufficient inventories and our expectations regarding future competitive positions, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including general economic and market conditions, such as the macroeconomic environment and the flooding in Thailand, and matters specific to our business, such as customer demand for and acceptance of our products and services.","We describe these factors in our accompanying press release, which we have filed in an 8-K with the SEC as well as in our 10-K and 10-Q reports also on file with the SEC and available on our website, all of which are incorporated by reference in today's discussion.","All numbers discussed today are GAAP unless stated otherwise. To see the reconciling items between non-GAAP and GAAP, you may refer to the table in our press release, our supplemental commentary or on our website. In a moment, Nick will walk you through some additional color on our financial results, and then Tom will walk you through his perspective on the business this quarter.","I'll now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Thank you, Shauna. Good afternoon, everyone. I realize many of you just joined us from HP's call and wanted to thank HP for coordinating the timing with us today.","Q4 marks another quarter of solid financial performance by NetApp. Revenue of $1.7 billion was above the midpoint of our previous guidance, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.66 was just over the high end of our Q4 guidance. We closed our ninth consecutive quarter of over 20% year-over-year product revenue growth and, with full year revenues of $6.23 billion, a year of 22% total revenue growth. Our Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific geographies all showed healthy revenue growth trends on a Q4 year-over-year and full year basis.","NetApp branded revenue grew 14% sequentially in Q4 and 9% for the full year, and revenue growth trends for both SEM and service revenue remained stable. Total OEM customer revenue declined 17% sequentially in the quarter, which corresponds to a seasonally slow first quarter for many of our OEM customers.","Full year E-Series revenue was just under $700 million, and coincident with our one-year anniversary of the E-Series transaction, we completed the last of the integration activities. Going forward, we expect to talk about E-Series revenue as part of total NetApp branded or total NetApp OEM revenue as appropriate.","So overall revenue performance was in line with our expectations despite the continued dynamics around hard disk drives. We exceeded both our gross and operating margin targets for Q4, achieving non-GAAP gross margin of 59.6% and non-GAAP operating margin of 17.9%.","For the full year, non-GAAP gross margins were just under 61% and non-GAAP operating margins were just under 18%, reflecting stronger margins in the first half of the fiscal year before the impact of the Thailand flooding on disk drive supply and costs.","In Q4, our non-GAAP operating expenses were 42% of revenue, reflecting lower levels of spending and hiring. While hiring was slow in Q4, net new headcount grew by almost 2,000 in fiscal 2012, an increase of 19% over last year end.","For Q1, we expect to closely monitor our operating expenses during our seasonally slow first quarter.","Our Q4 effective tax rate was 19%, reflecting some yearend onetime true-ups, which increased our full year effective tax rate to 17.9%, slightly higher than our forecast of 17.5%.","Non-GAAP EPS grew 14% sequentially and 12% year-over-year in Q4. And for the full year, non-GAAP EPS was $2.41, up 10% from fiscal year 2011.","Turning to the balance sheet. We closed the year with a record $5.4 billion of cash and investments. Our deferred revenue balance increased by $270 million, up 22% year-over-year, consistent with each of Q1, 2 and 3 of fiscal year 2012. Our ability to generate cash remains robust as we just closed our best-ever quarter in cash from operations.","Cash from operations was $583 million in Q4, an increase of 27% from the same period last year. Free cash flow was $459 million for the quarter and over $1 billion for the fiscal year, marking our second year of over $1 billion in free cash flow and coming in at 17% of total revenue.","Our diluted share count increased by about 8 million shares sequentially to about 382 million shares, primarily due to a higher average quarterly share price in Q4. The accounting for the shares associated with our convertible notes and warrants had a modest impact with about 10 million shares related to the convertible notes and just under 1 million shares associated with the warrants included in diluted share count.","You may recall that 80% of the convertible notes are hedged. If we were to adjust the share count to reflect the hedge, the non-GAAP EPS would have been about $0.01 higher. You can find a table on our website which shows the impact on diluted share count for a range of stock prices.","Turning to guidance. As always, there are many factors that influence our numbers. Currently, the increasing uncertainty about the broader macro-environment plays a prominent role. This lack of clarity about the global economy limits our visibility at this time to accurately forecast our customer buying patterns going forward. For this reason, we are not planning to give full year fiscal 2013 guidance now or at our upcoming Analyst Day.","From Q1, our target revenue range is $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 15% sequential decline and 1% year-over-year decline in revenue. This decline is a combination of our typical Q4 to Q1 ongoing revenue dynamics as well as conservatism with respect to the overall macro-environment.","We expect consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 60% to 61%, up from Q4 and consistent with our strong competitive position and cost discipline.","Due to the impact of the conservatism we're building in on revenue, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 11% to 12%.","Using our expected blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 17.5%, our non-GAAP earnings per share for Q1 should range from approximately $0.34 to $0.39 per share. Diluted share count is projected to decrease slightly to approximately 380 million shares in Q1 based on our average stock price of $38.11 for the first 10 days of the quarter. This will include about 7 million shares from the convertible notes.","Recall that the favorable impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset. If we were to adjust the share count for the convertible note hedge, that would add about $0.01 to the EPS guidance.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tom for his thoughts. Tom?","Thomas Georgens","Thanks, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. Our performance this quarter demonstrated strong execution in many areas of the business. We had year-over-year revenue growth of 19%, strong cash generation and improved gross margins and operating margins. Our robust product revenue growth stands out in the industry and demonstrates the continued expansion of our channels and market presence.","In Q4, we generated a record number of transactions, over 5 million, and had the highest Storage 5000 new customer acquisition quarter in over 3 years.","Our Americas commercial and Asia Pacific geographies had solid performance in both the fourth quarter and the year. Americas commercial revenue grew 30% year-over-year for both the quarter and the fiscal year. And Asia Pacific geography grew 55% in the quarter and just under that for the year.","The stronger geos were partially offset by softness in EMEA and the U.S. Public Sector. Our Q4 EMEA revenue growth of 8% year-over-year was the weakest fourth quarter for EMEA since April 2009. And we are seeing longer sales cycles, smaller transactions and slowdowns even in the countries where we have traditionally been strong.","Also, lower defense-related spending continues to affect our U.S. Public Sector, with revenue down for the quarter and flat for the year. In addition, our major account growth lagged the rest of the business, as it has for most of the fiscal year.","Our relationship with our partners continues to grow and deepen as our business fulfilled through the channel finished the year at 79% of Q4 revenue. Our 2 largest partners, Arrow and Avnet, grew to 31% of Q4 revenue, up from 26% last quarter. Arrow hit a new milestone, surpassing $1 billion in revenue for the fiscal year.","Reflecting the strength of our product offerings and partner ecosystem, we shipped a record number of 2000 series systems in Q4, with units up 43% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. As expected, units of the 3000 were down slightly in Q4 as a result of the transition to the newly refreshed 2000 series.","The momentum of the 6000 series continued as we had another very strong quarter. After increasing year-over-year unit counts by 2.5x last quarter, our 6000 series units in Q4 were up again sequentially, up 58% year-over-year and just about double for the full year. The ongoing growth of our 6000 series shows our increasing participation in high-end deployments, especially large-scale NAS and deeper penetration into business-critical data center workloads.","Data ONTAP currently has the largest market share of any operating system in the storage industry. ONTAP 8 continues its innovation leadership by merging the richest and most sophisticated data management platform with the architectural capability of clustering to provide unlimited performance, availability and scale.","As the innovation leader in the industry and the only company offering a unified scale-out platform, we are the clear choice for enterprises as they rearchitect their data centers to build private clouds.","Since its release in November, we have been encouraged with the progress of ONTAP 8.1. And with over 6,000 systems installed, we are pleased with its rapid adoption. Last quarter, we announced its general availability.","Using ONTAP 8.1 in Cluster-Mode, our customers are now running an ever-increasing variety of workloads, including VMware, Oracle and Microsoft applications using both SAN and NAS protocols. While others offer disparate architectures for different workloads, we focus on minimizing the number of architectures our customers need, thereby enabling to build homogeneous, multi-tenant storage infrastructures that dramatically reduce complexity and cost.","Fiscal year 2012 marked the launch of the E-Series family of products, the result of our biggest acquisition to date. With continued product leadership and significant execution, we exceeded our full year E-Series OEM revenue expectations and closed the year close to our overall revenue goal.","We are pleased that many of our OEM partners have embedded the newest E-Series technology into their future product offerings, and we continue to make progress in the market with our E-Series branded solutions, including high-performance computing, seismic processing, full-motion video, media management and Hadoop workloads.","This quarter, we introduced our first new major release of the E-Series software since the acquisition. It is the largest release the team has ever produced, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to the development and evolution of this platform. The new release provides our OEMs with features like thin provisioning and asynchronous replication. It also includes an industry first, dynamic disk pooling, which dramatically decreases risk by significantly reducing the rebuild times of very large disk drives.","In addition to our achievements with E-Series, we've had continuous success in each of our 3 prior acquisitions, both in terms of revenue and integration into our technology road map. Combined, revenue from these 3 acquisitions grew 30% in fiscal year 2012 from the previous year.","On the big data front, enterprises are grappling with both the management of the growth, scale and diversity of the data that businesses generate as well as deriving value from all the information in their possession. Dealing with these massive data issues starts with selecting the right enterprise storage infrastructure. Even before introducing clustering, NetApp was the leader in managing data at scale as we have over 100 customers with more than 10 petabytes of data and some with over 100 petabytes of data. However, managing very large amounts of data is just the first phase of big data.","The next step is to leverage the information inside those data sets. Our unique ability to unify the storage of both structured and unstructured data with a single architecture enables our customers to simplify access to that data, transform it into high-quality information and provide deeper business insights to produce better business decisions.","We have consistently said that flash will be deployed throughout the hardware stack, and our flash offerings will be aggressive and multifaceted. Our belief is that offering flash primarily in the form of the cache is the most efficient and effective way to deploy this technology in storage arrays, and most of the industry is now following this approach.","With an over 50% attach rate in our 3240 and 3270 systems and 0.5 terabyte of flash embedded in every 6000 system, NetApp is on the forefront of flash integration. In addition, our R&D pipeline contains projects to further exploit the use of flash on other layers of the stack, and our next release of ONTAP will contain additional flash-related offerings.","FlexPod growth continues to be robust as we now have over 850 worldwide customers using this solution. This quarter, we expanded the platform portfolio by releasing a new entry-level version for smaller workloads. This provides greater flexibility, scalability and customer choice by supporting multiple hypervisors and business applications as customers build out their multi-tenant private clouds. We have also added new FlexPod design architecture for Microsoft, the first validated data center infrastructure to support Microsoft System Center 2012.","One workload where we are seeing significant activity is desktop virtualization, a technology whose viability is substantially enhanced by our storage efficiency leadership. The consumerization of IT and workforce mobility initiatives continue to drive demand for this technology. We see strong activity of financial services where we have implemented solutions at 8 of the 10 top global banks, and we are seeing momentum in the health care and education sectors.","This past year, we saw approximately 75% growth in revenue from systems used for desktop virtualization, and it has helped us deepen the Cisco partnership as it is the most popular workload deployed on the FlexPod.","In Q4, the impact of drive pricing and supply constraints on our revenue and gross margin played out essentially as we expected. We see drive availability returning to normal, although spot shortages will likely occur around individual drive types since buffer inventories have not yet been rebuilt.","Pricing remains elevated relative to pre-flood levels, and some of this has been passed along to end users. As drive supply continues to normalize, we expect over time to once again see price erosion from the drive vendors.","While we remain confident in our product differentiation, and this quarter we once again proved our ability to compete and win, there are increasing macroeconomic concerns that are hard to predict and beyond our control. With the deteriorating macro-environment affecting many European countries and slow-growing U.S. economy, many are calling for low growth in IT budgets through the remainder of 2012.","Historically, storage has taken a larger share of IT budgets, and we believe this will still be the case. However, given the increasing uncertainty in the macro-environment and the fact that Q1 is almost always our most challenging quarter, we are being particularly cautious about our Q1 guidance.","Given the multitude of factors influencing enterprise spending, we have limited visibility into our full fiscal year 2013. And as Nick indicated, we are not planning to provide full year guidance at this time. As we look back over the fiscal year, we have many accomplishments to be proud of, another year of over 20% revenue growth, the successful integration of our largest acquisition and our strong cash generation.","In addition, we recently earned a place on the Fortune 500 list and celebrated our 20th anniversary as a company. All these accomplishments would not have been possible without the ongoing dedication and support of our employees, partners and customers.","Thank you for joining us today. And I hope you will attend our Analyst Day on June 26 in New York, where we will talk further about our innovation, our strong competitive positioning and how by focusing on customer success we've built and will continue to build a growth company of scale.","At this point, I will open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jayson Noland from Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Tom, it sounds like your channel SMB business is fairly healthy. The other categories are not. I guess just trying to understand with the guide how much of that is macroeconomic concern versus your actual pipeline right now.","Thomas Georgens","Well, certainly the momentum of the 2000 has been very, very strong, and you can see the Arrow and Avnet performance. On the other hand, the 6000 was spectacularly strong, and basically units in that space have doubled year-over-year. So I don't know if I would separate those 2. Just as I look about the guidance, I think a couple of things that are in play. Clearly, Q1 is our most challenging quarter. And if you look over the last decade, not just the last couple of years, it's always been a situation we've had some shortfalls. If you look at the normal seasonality of NetApp, typically you'll see, particularly in this growth range, probably a negative 10% Q4 to Q1 transition. That's roughly what we saw coming into this year. We got the bellwethers out there, people with broader coverage than we do, talking -- basically taking their guidance down by another 2% to 5%. NetApp is probably a little bit more overweighted from an EMEA and the U.S. Public Sector point of view.  You throw in FX on top of that, on and on and on. But I think if you just add those factors together, it's pretty easy to come to a 15% reversal from Q4. So maybe the market is different, and maybe we're being too pessimistic on the macro. But I don't think anybody knows what the future holds. But given that it's our Q1, which is always a challenge, I think we want to be careful. But one thing we do know is the quarter we just put up and where we came ahead of the guidance, we came in over the top of the range on EPS and I think we had momentum at the very, very low end and also at the high end. So while we're a little cautious about the future, I think the one thing we do know is the number we just produced, and I think we're pretty strong this quarter across the board.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just with the guidance you've given, it just seems that unless you have a very strong recovery, especially in earnings, in the back half of the year, the earnings this year actually could be down. I know you don't want to give guidance. I'm just wondering apart from the macro concerns in the near term, what's the confidence on a strong snapback that could happen in the second half of the fiscal year? What kind of fundamentals should we be thinking about?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think -- I know on gross margin, any reversal on the revenue has a big impact on the EPS in both directions. So if you just look at the quarter we just produced, we saw solid operating margin. We saw increased gross margins. I think with the drive situation, there's opportunity for increased margins going forward, so that part we are forecasting. But the big lever for us is going to be the top line number. I think we're clearly -- we're prudent this quarter in terms of headcount. I think we're going to watch expenses very closely as the year goes on. So I don't think we'll be very aggressive on that front. But that said, if the revenue stays depressed, it will be hard to get the numbers back. But on the other hand, if the revenue does rebound, I think the business model is still absolutely intact. And I think there is opportunity for tremendous amounts of expansion of EPS. It's all going to hinge on the top line, and that's going to hinge on the macro, and that's why we're going to stay away from full year guidance at this time.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, Tom [indiscernible] guys and like if you given how you expect to start this first quarter, with IT purchase growing, let's say, low single-digits, you would at least track that for the full year, do you think? Or is it hard to say?","Thomas Georgens","I think it depends on -- it certainly depends on the mix of storage. It depends on the mix of a number of things. I think one of the things that's a little bit different where we said this year than last year is APAC has been -- had a big year for us, up 50%. America had a big year for us, up 30%. But I think we also have a counterbalance there of U.S. Public Sector and EMEA. And I think how that balance plays out over time, are those sectors going to pull down the U.S.?  Will Asia slow?  That will lead us in one direction.  Or will they rebound?  And time will tell. So I think for us, when there's this type of uncertainty, our focus is on market share. 19% product growth, I think, clearly, is an industry-leading number. And I think that will be our focus going forward. So I admit it will be tough to model, that's why we're not giving full year guidance, but I do see gross margin expansion, and I think the bottom line will be purely a function of how the top line performs over the course of the next 9 months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","In terms of your reported results and kind of also looking forward, first, can you give the configured versus nonconfigured business revenue from a product perspective? And can you talk about what's in that, the E-Series contribution for both? And then also, you had mentioned Data ONTAP 8, kind of a next-gen operating system. Can you give us -- as your closest competitor continues to talk about Isilon and Mavericks, et cetera, can you give us any sense of timing or how we should think about that launch?","Thomas Georgens","Yes. So I think there's a few questions. I'm not quite sure I understand the configured or nonconfigured, so maybe I'll let Nick answer that. But let me take the 8.1 question. As we think about -- we think about Isilon, but I think the broader thing to understand about 8.x or where that's heading is when I say there's a combination of Data ONTAP, which is the world's richest data management suite and on its own is the #1 market share in -- as any individual operating system. So taking that functionality and marrying it with the capability of clustering, and from that point of view, it allows us to take that data management capability and add, effectively, what clustering can bring, which is really unlimited scale, unlimited performance and nondisruptive operation, and that's really the vision of ONTAP -- of ONTAP 8. So while certainly, scale-out NAS and the Isilon is clearly a place where that technology can play, I think just as relevant as the evolution of that data -- of that technology is basically to go deeper into the data center and basically marry this data management capability with scale and open up a much, much broader set of applications to us. So data ONTAP 8.1 is not necessarily a head on head with Isilon. It's in fact the way we're going to attack business apps and the data center to fundamentally change the way data is being done. So when I look at where 8.1 is going, certainly we see deployment. We have Isilon and some of the other scale-out products. But still the predominant use of 8.1 is actually business applications deep in the data center at larger and larger scale. And I'd say that the 8.1 adoption kind of falls into a few categories right now. There are some that just want the latest functionality right away to build very, very large clusters right out of the chute. There are others that are evaluating it and trying to understand a little bit more. But the other ones understand that what this really is, is an infrastructure decision. It's basically an infrastructure choice that they're going to make about how they're going to deploy storage in the future regardless of the applications they run. So the customers that are actually making that decision is really where the future momentum is just going to come from, and that is they're going to standardize on this to run their business applications, to run their scale-out NAS, to run their big data deployments all around a single architecture. So when I think about 8.1, I don't think about it at all in on the Isilon range. I mean, certainly we compete there with it, and that will be the case. But the bulk of our engagement with EMC is around their traditional offerings and their core product offerings in the data center, and that's where I expect this technology to have its greatest root.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So, Tom, if I can follow on that. You alluded to a next-gen operating system in the pipeline.  Is that something that we expect to see over the next couple of quarters?","Thomas Georgens","I don't think I alluded to a next-gen operating system. I think I alluded to more functionality coming from 8.1, but they're -- I certainly didn't allude to any 8, 9. something or anything along those lines.","Nicholas R. Noviello","So, Aaron, just with respect to your question on configured-nonconfigured, we put some of those numbers which are subcomponents of product revenue into our Qs. I don't have some of those numbers available to me right now. What I would say on an organic basis on the product side of the fence, so if I pull out the E-Series OEM, we've got a sequential growth of 15% and a year-over-year of 6%. So those are probably numbers that help you in terms of understanding what's going on in terms of the product outside of the acquired E-Series OEM.","Thomas Georgens","I think on the broader question of configured-nonconfigured, I don't know if that's getting into are we upgrading systems or selling new ones. All I can say is the unit count numbers were up big this quarter, both on the 2000 and the 6000. So clearly, we're landing new footprints.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question, everyone has a concern and maybe you can help us understand now why the conviction that you may not be losing share to so many competitors. If I look at EMC's product growth, at least the margin was 5 points ahead of what you guys just reported. And then just beyond that, if demand is going to get constrained throughout the year, do you expect pricing to get more severe that may negate some of the drive savings you get going forward?","Thomas Georgens","So I'm not quite sure where you come -- I'm not quite sure of the comparable numbers. But if I just look at the storage industry, you've had -- Dell just reported 2 consecutive quarters of negative growth, you've had IBM report 2 consecutive quarters of negative growth. And I don't know what HP reported today, but their prior quarter was negative growth. And on a product growth perspective, you have EMC report 4 consecutive quarters of declining product -- year-over-year product growth, and it was 3% this past quarter. So we were 19% -- I'm sorry, we were above that. Obviously, I would say on the product growth, we're 19%. And even if you back out the OEM, we're above that. So the idea that the rest of the industry is outgrowing us, I guess I don't see it. So from that perspective, from product growth perspective, certainly EMC of the 3 is the best of the lot. I'll give you that. But on the other hand, the numbers that we just reported are better than that.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess as we look at the organic numbers and I had, I'll check mine, but I had you at a plus 2.5 ex Engenio and EMC at plus 7. But I can take that offline. But very broadly, should we just talk about pricing dynamic...","Thomas Georgens","No, no, no, let's stop on that. So EMC's, I'm talking about product growth here, so they were plus 7 overall. The product growth was 3. And the NetApp number from a product growth perspective year-over-year was 21. And even if you back out Engenio, it's still well above 3. So those are the numbers that we're looking at.","Operator","Our next question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just to broaden the discussion over the last couple of questions. Over the last quarter or 2, you've talked about a more competitive landscape and aggressive pricing. Would you describe the situation today as worse, same or better than it was in the January quarter?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Katy, it's Nick. Let me address that. I mean, last quarter, we talked about some specific numbers in terms of the gross margins and the gross margin guidance we gave. So in the last quarter, when we gave guidance for the fourth quarter, we said gross margins would be approximately 59%. And we came in higher than that. We've come in higher on the product gross margin side as well. And when I look at the quarter with respect to discounting, with respect to mix, with respect to supply and drive constraint, all of those things were consistent or we did better than our forecast on all of those. In addition, we're talking about gross margins of 60% to 61% go-forward. So we've continued to say that it's a dynamic environment out there. However, I think we're doing pretty well in terms of what we did in Q4 in terms of gross margin guidance and the go-forward.","Thomas Georgens","One point I'd -- to your point, Katy, is if I remember right, in the last quarter, as we did the bridge on gross margin, we had some costs associated with new customer acquisition. And actually the new customer acquisition this quarter was actually better than the last quarter. But last quarter, we had some big identifiable deals that I could really point out and attribute that to. So I'm guessing is that some of those new deals probably will be costly again, but they weren't as identifiable in the pack. But overall, as Nick indicated, usually Q4 is where we see gross margin decline even further historically. So we forecasted, I believe, on this call 90 days ago was 59%, and we actually came in a bit higher than that.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So fair to say that the conservative guidance is almost entirely macro related, and nothing that you're seeing on the competitive environment is driving the conservatism?","Thomas Georgens","Yes. In fact, we're actually continuing to see an improvement on the gross margin. So we've actually gone that far out on a limb. Broadly, clearly, I see this more as a macro dynamic. I think this quarter was solid. Last quarter was solid. It isn't to say that competition isn't intense, I just don't see it any different. But I would say that the macro climate, even look at the guidance of the other bellwethers and even look at the relative storage performance and growth rates of the other players in this industry, I still think it's a bit challenging, and I think we need to be careful. And the other factor, I think, that we have at this point in time is our Q1. And I kind of like to say in Q2, we've got the end of the government fiscal year to help us. At the end of -- in Q3, we have the end of the calendar year. In Q4, we have the end of our fiscal year. But in Q1, we've got nothing to work for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Marshall from ISI Group.","Brian Marshall - Gleacher & Company, Inc., Research Division","The quarter was good, but the guidance, frankly, is a real head-scratcher to me. I think -- my financial model on NetApp goes back 16 years, and I just went and looked back 16 years, I couldn't find a period where revenues were down 15% for Q1, which is your midpoint of your guidance. So it seems to me like the situation in EMEA is not new.  So I guess kind of questioning that level of decline in Q1. And then point #2 would be OpEx. So the guidance roughly implies that OpEx is going to be flat on an absolute dollar basis sequentially. And the last time we did have a material decline in revenue was back in July of 2007. And so when I look at that period, revenues were down 14% sequentially. The OpEx was down about 6% sequentially, so down about $22 million on an absolute dollar basis. So I guess the question is, in light of revenues being down so much sequentially, couldn't we get the OpEx down more as well?","Thomas Georgens","So I guess on the broader question of the sequential, yes, I don't think we've had a 15% sequential Q4 to Q1 transfer. And I think as we look at it, it's not uncommon for us, particularly with this forward growth projection, even if you go back to the consensus estimates for the full year, we're in that range in the mid-teens where you guys are forecasting. It's not uncommon for us to see 10% from Q4 to Q1. And so I'm not saying that that's suddenly 15%. I'd say that one of the things that is different is that even if you look at the guidance of the other players, you look at the guidance of the guys who just reported in the last couple of days and Cisco and the other bellwethers who have a bigger, broader footprint than we do, clearly they're taking its guidance down for future consensus. So I think if you compound those factors and if you further go at the areas that are weakening or potentially weak, EMEA and U.S. Public Sector, we're probably a little bit more overweighted than them, than some of the other guys, and then FX and whatever. So I guess what I'd say is I'd start with kind of normal Q1 to -- or Q4 to Q1 seasonality kind of in the 9% or 10% range. And then you can decide what type of factors you want to add on top of that. But if you look at the rate at which people are taking down their consensus, that's another 3 points or 4 points or whatever. It doesn't take much to get to 15% without even talking about anything that's specific to NetApp.","Nicholas R. Noviello","And, Brian, it's Nick. Let me add one thing. If you take out the inorganic OEM revenue from Q1 last year, you'll see from Q4 to Q1 a 9% revenue decline, okay? Sequentially, just one year ago, all right? So that's something to keep in mind as well. And then on the OpEx side of the fence, you're talking about a virtually flat. There's a variety of things going on. Also, if you think back to this prior year, we took guidance off the table. We obviously had planned for a year higher. Some of the variable compensation types of items were a tailwind for us last year earlier in the year. Those things we have to reset back up to 100%. So those types of plans will be headwind as we go into Q1. And we're offsetting it with spending conservative in a variety -- conservatism in a variety of other areas. So that's how you're getting to the flattish on the OpEx for Q1.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray.","Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I guess I just wanted to just real quick sort of expand on that OpEx question from Brian, the last question.  So historically, you've said that if the macro-environments deteriorate, you take action to protect your 16% operating margins.  The macro clearly deteriorated, and you noted that you have limited visibility beyond Q1. So is it fair to assume you're still thinking you can get to 16% for FY '13, given that you're not reining in spending yet?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think the year has just begun. I think from our point of view, it's really hard to modulate expenses in direct proportion to the seasonality of the business. And yes, we got the macro overhang, which is basically adding to the seasonality, kind of the sum of 2 factors. So I think at this point in time, yes, the real question is, how long is this going to last? And I think if we felt that this is a protracted situation and we weren't going to be able to get back to the model any time soon, then clearly, we'd have to take some action. But on the other hand, if we believe that this is something -- a storm that we can weather -- remember, in Q4 we were very much on the model, and now we're into Q1. And what's really changed since then, I think really is the macro concern. And the question is, is it going to reverse? But as long as we believe that we can gain share, we can continue to grow this business and we want to position ourselves when this bounces back, then I don't think we're going to overreact to the near term. On the other hand, if this is protracted, then just as we did the last time we went through this back in 2008, 2009, when the sense was this is going to be a relatively long-duration thing, so it's not going to bounce back right away, then we take action. So I think you certainly have our commitment to basically take action that we see necessary. But on the other hand, we don't want to basically whipsaw the operating expense around a single quarter or even a 6-month phenomenon. If we think this thing is coming back in the second half -- second half of our fiscal year as others may have predicted, then I think we'd ride the storm out. But if we think it's going to persist, then clearly, we're going to take action similar to what we've done in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Pacific Crest.","Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Also wanted to kind of follow up on kind of the theme here relative to this disconnect between kind of the April quarter and your July guide. If I look at kind of the April quarter, you have a nice recovery in the NetApp branded business offset by kind of OEM decline. Your July guidance obviously implies a meaningful step-down. In fact, a 20% sequential decline in product revenue, if you just assume that services and software, like they historically have been in Q1, are flat, does imply a change. And I guess the question I have is, one, do you expect another big step-down in the OEM, and if you do, why are you seeing a step-down in OEM? Two, on the NetApp core business, why aren't you seeing a bigger recovery there and is there something in the pipeline that makes you concerned? And then, three, you are guiding to the biggest sequential drop in operating margins that we've seen in the history of the company.  Is there something you're doing different here? And again, I know you're going to adjust OpEx relative to a protracted environment where you don't see the growth. But the organic growth of the business has been in a single-digit protracted 6% growth rate by our calculation for fiscal 2012, and you're guiding to a 1% organic growth rate for Q1, which would make, what, 5 quarters in a row now of single-digit growth?  So trying to kind of balance all of these things. A good quarter, a nice recovery in the core NetApp business. But again, this outlook that does imply something else is wrong, is there something company-specific here that we need to be worried about?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think if you look at the OEM business, it's going to be a function of the Storage business of the OEMs themselves. And certainly, their outlook has not been great. So I think that's one factor. I think if you go forward, clearly -- I don't know if can I agree on the 20%. I have to do that calculation myself, but it's still a big number. And it's the sum of those 2 factors. So as Nick indicated, the 9% was typical of us going into this year. We actually had a decent growth quarter in Q1. And the other thing is I'd be a little bit careful of the year-over-year compares in the \"core\" business, because a couple of things come into play there. One of which is now with IBM, now that we own the DS and the N series, we're kind of ambivalent about which way that business goes, while, obviously, a year ago, we had a preference.  And likewise, to some extent in the channel, where there's opportunity to sell either product. So to assume that the NetApp branded business is the same as it would have been had we not done the acquisition is probably not entirely accurate. That's probably a little bit of a pessimistic assumption. But overall, I think in the grand scheme of things, I think if we did not have this broader concern about the macro and watching what other companies are doing with their guidance, I think we would have been absolutely normal. And what you should have expect from us is a nominal minor 10%, just like we did last year in the core business. So if you use that as a baseline, we're really debating, is the rest of it macro or is it us? And you can debate whether we're being overly pessimistic or not. But I guess the only point I'll come back to -- the only thing we do know is the quarter we just had. And I think the quarter was strong. We saw increasing gross margins. We see that going forward. As far as the OpEx and EPS margin drop, I mean that's effectively a top-line discussion, right? OpEx is flat, gross margins are actually improving. So what we're talking about is the top line, and I think that's the thing that we need to monitor. As that goes, so will go the EPS.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz from JPMorgan.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Tom, if I could follow up on your commentary there in terms of the only thing you know is the quarter you just had. Does the 2240 now being fully available, does that maybe have an outsized contribution to the April quarter, and that's why you're also maybe a little cautious? And then my bigger question here is just, I really appreciate your comments around flash during the prepared remarks in terms of your strategy. But I guess if we think about extreme I\/O, I think NetApp was trying to make a bid for that asset. Clearly remained [ph] a few years ago, NetApp lost that asset. Are we getting to a point now, especially with the stock, where it's indicated in [ph] after hours where NetApp maybe needs to consider maybe locking up or partnering up with a bigger, deeper-pocketed partner to really go up against EMC going forward?","Thomas Georgens","Well, okay. So those are a couple -- I presume you don't mean that in order to compete for winning these deals. As far as individual transactions, we're not going to comment at any deal. Obviously, we spend time with a lot of people and visit a lot of people, talk to a lot of people and talk about potential engagements. We do that constantly. As far as flash goes, I see that as a vehicle innovation and a way to promulgate our data management capability. And that's going to be the key part of our strategy. So I think you should expect us to do things organically, and you'll see some of those, as I indicated in our upcoming release of 8.1. You'll see it inorganically and you'll see it through partnerships. So I think you'll see NetApp participating on flash on multiple dimensions, and primarily, it is to basically expand our data management footprint. I kind of lost sight of the other question.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Do we need to partner up with a bigger person?","Thomas Georgens","Do we need to partner up with a bigger person? I'd say, let's just go down that list again, right? IBM has had 2 consecutive down quarters in storage. Dell has had 2 consecutive down quarters in storage. I don't know the latest on HP, but they were down a quarter ago. We had Hitachi, which had a good year last year and then guided basically flat for this fiscal year starting in April. We have at EMC has had 4 consecutive quarters of declining product growth. So if we had a bigger sales force, could we sell more? If that's the question, I think the answer is yes. On the other hand, I don't see who the player is that we would connect to that would suddenly give us any more leverage that we currently have.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just to follow up on the 2240, did that have an outsized contribution to your fourth quarter result and that's why maybe you're being conservative as well?","Thomas Georgens","No. I think it's great to have the momentum there. But -- and it's great to see the 2000 be strong again. We clearly went through a slow patch roughly a year ago. We've been accelerating. We had a good quarter last quarter and an even better quarter this quarter. Obviously, over 10,000 units, an all-time high. But let's not lose sight of the high end. Let's not lose sight of what the 6000 did. I mean, the 6000 doubled year-over-year. It's up 58% this quarter. It's up 207% last quarter. So I think we have momentum on the number front. I think the 2240 is probably carving out part of the 3000, simply because it's new and the 3000 is an older product line. But I think both the large systems and the small systems have a tremendous amount of momentum right now. So I wouldn't say that's just one segment. Clearly, those 2 products are serving 2 different segments of the market, and they both seem to be doing well.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Freed from Wunderlich Securities.","Brian Freed - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","If we try and predict your growth going forward, I know you don't want to give specific guidance, but as we think of your business relative to the storage industry, what multiple of the industry growth rate for storage do you think you can grow on an organic basis moving forward?","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I hate to have that bring up the question if the growth is -- if there's a decline in the industry, do we decline at twice the rate?  I still think that -- I mean, if you just go through those numbers that we just put out there, from a product revenue, which is the thing that drives market share, I should think we had the highest product revenue growth of anybody this past quarter. So I still see us as a share gainer. Our focus is on a point of share. And depending on the growth of the market, that will vary. So do I still think we can double the growth in the market -- double the growth of the business? Yes, I do, particularly if it's a small number. So I still feel good about where we are. I still feel good about this quarter. But if you can predict the future better than I can, then have at it. You can adjust our numbers accordingly. But I think for now, given that it's our Q1, which is never our strength, and given -- the question, earlier question said, nothing's really changed about Europe.  I suggest that it has. Perhaps nothing has really changed about U.S. Public Sector spending, and that's probably not going to change anytime soon, perhaps the election later in the year. But overall, I think -- I feel good about the momentum. I just wish I had more visibility.","Brian Freed - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So your goal is to grow by gaining a point in the market share in the coming year?","Thomas Georgens","Yes, that's right. And NetApp in its history has only gained a point of share twice.  Once was last year, and the other was the year before, and that doesn't count the acquisition.","Operator","The next question comes from Ryan Bergan from Craig-Hallum Capital.","Ryan R. Bergan - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Just wondering what your long-term free cash flow growth rate ranges are going forward.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Okay, Ryan. It's Nick. Look, we obviously did in the 17% range for the year, 17% of revenue for the year. Second year, over $1 billion in free cash flow, so we feel very good about that. We've shown some charts in the past that have some revenue associated with them as well. You got to look at what revenue growth is going to be to be able to back in what free cash flow as a percentage of revenue is going to be. But we've talked about numbers in the 20s, right? In the low-20 range, and we've been able to do that multiple quarters and years in a row. So this year is a little lighter. This past year, I should say, behind us a little lighter. This coming quarter, I'd caution you that we generally have not a great first quarter of free cash flow. But those types of ranges we've talked about in the past, assuming the revenue growth, I think are still reasonable.","Operator","Next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Brean Murray.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Hey, Tom. I just wanted to make sure I was clear on which areas that you have, I guess, the lack of visibility around -- the greatest lack of visibility and which area specifically you see as having changed since last quarter? And I was also just wondering about how the linearity for this quarter was.","Thomas Georgens","Okay. So I would say Public Sector is largely the same. And I think the dynamics are there, they're not great. Obviously, we're facing an election, and that may change things. But I think it may change emphasis, but not the overall macro picture. Asia Pacific was strong all year and remains that way. I'd say that in general, our concerns about Europe are clearly increasing. And it's not so much Greece, and it's not so much Italy. Those are relatively small markets for us. It's a spillover effect into the -- it's a spillover effect into basically the big enterprise countries: Germany, France, U.K. So from our perspective, I think that the spillover effect of this and what it means for the other countries is a concern. Obviously, there's just been an election in France, so we'll see what that yields. Beyond that, I think if you look at the U.S., I think it's still uneven. I think some sectors are clearly doing better than others. I'd say a sector that would worry us is financial services. I think that's one thing that is also subject to probably a declining sentiment from where we were 90 days ago. Other sectors in the U.S. are doing just fine: media, entertainment, consumer, health care. But I'd say that financial services, which is a big sector for us, is probably worse than it was. And I think EMEA, I don't know if it's worse. It probably is a little worse. But I'd say that the bands or the range of potential outcomes in the near term in EMEA is probably much greater today than it was 90 days ago. I think we'd get -- all sorts of things could happen if -- depending on the Greek elections, so what happens there, what happens to the Euro. So I think from my perspective, I think EMEA, the midpoint is probably a bit worse than it was 90 days ago. But I would say the range of outcomes is probably much wider than it was 90 days ago.","Nicholas R. Noviello","To answer your question on linearity. The linearity in the fourth quarter of '12 was actually better than that in fourth quarter of '11. You can also see the DSO declined, if you look at it year-over-year.","Operator","Next question comes from Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I apologize if this question was already asked. But digging into the guidance once again, I think we all understand the lack of visibility and the conservatism given the environment. But did you see anything quantitatively in the quarter that pushed you towards this aggressive sort of downtick in guidance? I remember back in 2007, you had a similar type of guide, not as bad, but a similar surprise. And you had drained backlog in the fourth quarter, and that depleted backlog ended up compressing the July quarter. Did you see anything like that in backlog this time around? And then so far in May, are you seeing weakness that would support this type of outlook as well?","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I think it's a little bit complicated in Q4 because it has a dynamic of being our fiscal year end and things of that nature. But from a backlog perspective, our backlog measure is effectively the same going into Q1 as it was going to Q1 last year. So I don't see that as a different data point. I think overall, I'd say that business was a challenge across the board, getting deals approved, getting large deals approved and fighting through that. I think we won more than our fair share of them. But I would say that activity was very selective. And I think we had to battle for it. And I'm actually quite proud of the team that not only we win our fair share of it, we actually increased margins in the process of doing so. So I think the execution is good. But I think that the aggregate demand certainly is not where it was certainly a year ago.","Operator","Your final question comes from Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Tom, could you talk a little bit about when the last time that you saw visibility was this low, number one?  And number two, what does the financial vertical represent as a percentage of business?","Thomas Georgens","Okay. I'll have to look it up. Financial is about 10% of our business. And as far as visibility, I would say what's a little bit different this time is that there's -- it's not only an economic concern. There's also a political concern involved, whether it be a U.S. election, whether it be the role of the European Union. And I think there's a level of complexity that as a businessman is a little bit hard to sort out here in terms of what could happen. And I think the other factor simply is, just to make it a NetApp story, is Q1 has hardly been our strength. And if there's going to be a quarter where we're going to be cautious and not want to get too far ahead of ourselves, particularly when there's a lot of unknowns out there, this is going to be it. So I think from that perspective, we're just going to basically play this one safe. I think you see the guidance of the other guys, I don't see them talking about any different dynamics than we are. And then you lay in our normal seasonality on top of that and perhaps a little bit about concentration in those 2 sectors and, likewise, even FX, I think it's pretty easy to kind of come up with a mid-teen sequential decline, and that's kind of where we are.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for participating in the NetApp Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, the IT capital spending environment, and our ability to expand our total available market acquire new accounts expand in existing accounts, capitalize on our Data Fabric strategy, improve our consistency of sales execution and continue our capital allocation strategy.","Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019, including the management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations and risk factors sections and our current reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to George.","George Kurian","Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into our results for the third quarter I want to take a moment to talk about Ron. Today we announced that, Ron has decided to retire by the end of the fiscal year. I want to recognize his many contributions since joining NetApp in 2016.","Under Ron's leadership, we have increased product margins by 10 points, nearly doubled our earnings power and raised our dividend by over 100%. He has played a pivotal role in helping NetApp navigate a transformational period as we focus on becoming the leader in hybrid cloud data services. I think you'll agree that he's always been a true and honest broker.","Knowing that this is his last earnings call before he retires is certainly bittersweet for me. We continuously think about what's next for the company and that includes thoughtful proactive succession planning.","To that end Ron and I have been talking about the prospect of this transition for some time. During the search process, we have been focused on finding the right person to take on the role of Chief Financial Officer, and I'm very pleased with the quality of candidates. I expect that we will have someone in the role before the end of the quarter. Ron will stay on to ensure a seamless transition and I'm grateful for that.","Ron Pasek","Thank you, George. Let me start by expressing my deep appreciation for the opportunity to work alongside the talented team here at NetApp. These past four years have been incredibly rewarding. The team has proved to be collaborative, innovative and empowering and I'm proud of what we have achieved during my time here.","I also want to thank the investor and analyst community as it's been a genuine pleasure working with all of you. This is an exciting time for our industry and for NetApp, and I look forward to helping our next CFO transition into the role.","George Kurian","Thank you, Ron. Now, let's turn to an overview of the quarter. Despite the top line challenges, we continued our operational discipline, highlighted by strong gross margin, cash flow and operating leverage without the benefit from anticipated ELA revenue in the quarter. These results reflect the strength of our business model as we take deliberate steps to better capitalize on our opportunity and return the company to growth. However, macroeconomic headwinds and unpredictability in large enterprise purchasing behavior persist.","Customers are on a journey to the cloud and they are looking to NetApp to help them as they grapple with the complexities of data management in hybrid multi-cloud IT environments. With our Data Fabric strategy, we help customers address these challenges giving us access to new buyers and workloads, as well as increasing the relevance of NetApp to companies both large and small.","We not only have opportunity in the public cloud, but we also have increased our value for on-premises deployments. Our ability to deliver real business value to customers' hybrid multi-cloud environments, fuels my confidence that we can return to growth. While we see exceptional opportunity ahead, we are planning our business assuming no change in external factors for the foreseeable future. To improve our execution in this environment, we laid out a plan at the start of the fiscal year to replicate our proven areas of success by getting in front of more buyers with our full portfolio.","We are on track to increase sales capacity by approximately 200 primary sales resources by the end of Q1 fiscal year 2021 without adding to the total operating expenses for the company. The majority of the sales headcount will be deployed in our Americas geography. They will be focused on acquiring new accounts and engaging new buyers like cloud architects in existing accounts.","We are seeing early signs of success by expanding our reach and focus on new customer acquisition. Our dedicated acquired districts continue to deliver strong growth across all metrics sales, units and customers. The growth of these metrics accelerated in Q3, as did the growth of the pipeline pointing to continued progress in coming quarters. While the acquired districts performed well, we still need to broaden our share of wallet at our largest customers. We are making progress here. However, it is in our largest accounts which have the greatest exposure to the macro that the demand environment is the least predictable.","In Q3, our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services increased from Q2 to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.3 billion. We introduced new all-flash array and hybrid flash array platforms as well as a SAN-optimized all-flash array, which delivers a simplified and dedicated SAN experience.","Our core storage offerings continue to gain industry accolades. Last quarter NetApp took the highest ranking in the leaders' quadrant of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for primary storage. In Q3, NetApp was named a leader in IDC's file-based storage MarketScape with the recommendation that customers in need of hybrid cloud solutions should consider NetApp, because of our expanded product portfolio investments and vision.","Our building blocks for private cloud deployments SolidFire, NetApp HCI and StorageGRID enable customers to bring public cloud-like experience and economics into their data centers. Our private cloud business, inclusive of products and services grew 10% from last quarter, attaining an annualized net revenue run rate of almost $350 million.","To meet the increasing demand for Object Storage, NetApp announced new StorageGRID software platforms and the ability to tier to Azure Blob Storage. IDC named NetApp a leader in its object-based storage MarketScape citing our vast experience in unstructured data. They recommend customers consider StorageGRID, when dealing with petabyte-scale data sets across various deployment locations because of its unique hybrid multi-cloud integrations.","Based on the last month of Q3, our annualized recurring revenue for cloud data services increased to approximately $83 million, up 146% year-over-year. We are now generally available with both Cloud Volumes Service and Cloud Volumes ONTAP for all the leading hyperscale cloud providers: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services.","Additionally, we added cloud compliance as a feature to Cloud Volumes ONTAP, which help customers comply with today's privacy and other data regulations. We continue to see a healthy mix of customers new to NetApp in our cloud services as they enable us to acquire new customers and reach new buyers as well as expand the data sets managed at existing customers. Our deep integration for a broad and growing range of use cases with the leading public clouds and industry-leading technology for on-premises storage solutions gives us a sustainable competitive advantage.","Let me share with you a few customer examples to illustrate how our data fabric strategy allows us to acquire new customers, expand our footprint at existing customers and increase our strategic value. A U.S.-based research hospital in one of our acquired districts chose to go with NetApp on-premises and in the cloud. Our ability to connect their data centers to each other and to multiple public cloud providers all with a consistent management interface placed us well ahead of the competition in addressing the customer's requirements.","A global retailer and current NetApp customer has halted its on-premises IT spending in favor of a Cloud First Strategy. They plan to migrate their large SAP HANA environment to the cloud to gain flexibility and speed of scale using Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Azure NetApp Files, because of our ability to help the customer easily migrate to the cloud we will retain not only the data currently managed by NetApp in their data centers, but we will also move competitor's on-premises footprints onto NetApp in the cloud.","And finally on our Q1 call, I told you that we were working with a Fortune 10 company to migrate its existing data centers to the cloud. That customer now has line of sight to move 100 petabytes of data, largely from our competitor systems to Azure NetApp Files. By partnering with them to achieve their cloud-first initiative, we have elevated NetApp from an infrastructure provider with a minority position in their data center to a key strategic partner.","The power of our Data Fabric strategy increases our strategic relevance to customers which creates long-term value for NetApp and our shareholders. It enables us to reach new buyers through new pathways address new workloads and expand our presence with existing customers and it drives our innovation agenda which we advanced significantly in the quarter.","We are delivering an enormous amount of value to a growing number of customers. Only NetApp has the strategy, the innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multi-cloud IT. Our strong business model resulting from the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and our cost structure over the last several years enables us to navigate the dynamics of the macro economy and customer demand environment while making the strategic investments necessary to cement our leadership in hybrid cloud data services.","With that I'll turn it over to Ron for more details on the quarter and our expectations. Ron?","Ron Pasek","Thanks, George. As a reminder I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers, unless otherwise noted. As George highlighted, in Q3 we delivered solid margins and operating leverage in the face of revenue weakness. Despite the demand uncertainty, we generated strong free cash flow and remain confident in our product leadership and strategy to reaccelerate growth going forward.","Before discussing our guidance, I'll provide further detail on our Q3 performance. In Q3 net revenues of $1.4 billion decreased 10% year-over-year. We had zero ELA revenue in the quarter, although we had expected approximately $50 million. Product revenue of $787 million, decreased approximately 19% year-over-year.","Moving down to P&L. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $556 million was up nearly 5% year-over-year with better execution in our renewals business starting to deliver results. Deferred revenue increased 6% year-over-year in Q3. Gross margin of 67.8% was above our guidance. Product gross margin was 55.4%, which is an increase of 2.8 points year-over-year.","The year-over-year improvement was driven by continued sales force discipline an increase in all-flash product mix and cost reductions. Q3 was the 12th straight quarter we increased product margins year-over-year when adjusting for the benefit of ELAs. The Q2 to Q3 seasonal decrease in product margins was driven by customer and product mix. We've seen almost no degradation in product margins as a result of increased NAND pricing.","The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 83.6% increased nearly 200 basis points year-over-year driven by continued productivity improvements. Q3 operating expenses of $640 million, increased approximately 2% year-over-year, driven by annual merit increases.","Operating margin was 22.2% and in line with our guidance. EPS of $1.16 was down 3% year-over-year but well within the guidance range. We closed Q3 with $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a positive one day, an increase of 12 days year-over-year. DSO of 53 days was up two days year-over-year. DIO was 22 days an increase of seven days year-over-year. And DPO was 75 days, down three days year-over-year.","Cash flow from operations was $420 million. Free cash flow was $388 million representing 28% of revenue. We are maintaining our expectation for free cash flow to be in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues in fiscal 2020. During Q3, we repurchased 8.2 million shares at an average price of $61.20 for a total of $500 million.","As of the end of Q3, we had $640 million remaining on our original $4 billion buyback authorization. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 229 million, down 26 million shares year-on-year, representing a 10% decrease. During the quarter we paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $608 million to shareholders in the quarter. Our fiscal Q4 cash dividend will be $0.48 per share.","Now on to guidance. As we've noted over the past several quarters, the demand environment continues to be challenged. As a result, we expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 4% decline in revenues year-over-year including 0.5 point of currency headwind.","Consistent with normal seasonal sequential decline in gross margin from Q3 to Q4 associated with product revenue being a larger portion of the overall revenue mix, we expect consolidated gross margin to range between 66% and 67%. We expect Q4 operating margin to range between 23% and 24%.","We expect earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.28 and $1.36 per share which at the midpoint implies an 8% increase year-over-year. The midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance implies that total fiscal 2020 revenue will be down 10% with ELAs being approximately 1% of total revenues.","Our Q4 guidance also implies fiscal 2020 gross margin of 67% to 68% and operating margin of approximately 21%. We expect fiscal 2020 EPS to be down approximately 7% year-over-year and within the range we guided last quarter. As George noted, we are seeing early signs of success from our strategic investments in sales coverage, which provides confidence in our ability to return the company to long-term growth.","I want to again thank the NetApp team, our shareholders, customers and partners for making the last four years a rewarding experience.","With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?","Kris Newton","Thanks, Ron. We will now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.","Karl Ackerman","Hey. Good afternoon. Thank you for letting me ask question. Ron, I guess, if -- I guess I'm not sure what we should assume for ELA revenue in the April quarter guide. But even if we were to back out ELA revenue in the guide it would seem that product gross margins will take a step down by a couple of hundred basis points. And so I guess am I missing something?","And then secondarily is that -- would that be based on component cost headwinds from NAND? Or are there other manufacturing costs we should be thinking about? Thank you. ","Ron Pasek","Thanks, Karl. So as you know we don't guide product margins discretely. But what we do have is about 1% of ELAs for the year in Q4 as opposed to what we had before is 2%. There's a lot of other -- so first of all in -- with respect to component costs it is a very small amount we saw quarter-to-quarter from Q2 to Q3. That was -- a headwind to gross margin was 0.1% so -- but there's a whole lot of other mix, right? There's mix by product. If we have a higher flash mix it tends to help margin all things being equal. We have higher software mix that helps gross margin. So there's a lot of dynamics under there. I wouldn't read anything into it with respect to component costs.","George Kurian","I think with regard to the Q4 guide, the gross margin picture is affected by the fact that the mix between products and services leans more to products than it did in Q3. That's the typical seasonality that we see in the Q4 seasonal pattern. So we are not seeing anything specific other than just the mix of product and services being a little different than it was this quarter.","Karl Ackerman","Thank you. Best of luck, Ron and thanks. It's great to meet you and hopeful as well. Thank you. ","Ron Pasek","Thanks Karl.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Karl. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.","Rod Hall","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Congratulations on the retirement Ron. Good working with you. And I wanted to just go back to these ELAs. I'm calculating if you're saying 1% of full year revenue I mean the exact calculation on that's about $55 million. I'm assuming this is a rough estimate it could be $50 million. But just three months ago you guys thought it'd be $100 million. And I'm just wondering what -- why you continue to think you've got visibility here and we have so much uncertainty on these ELAs and why include them in the guidance given all that.","Ron Pasek","We can see some of them. They're still difficult to predict but they always were back-end loaded so some of the ones that we expect in Q4 probably going to slip out of the year. That's really it. But it's a very different year than last year. Last year they're front-end loaded. This year they're back-end loaded.","As we told you they're difficult to predict in a quarter. And then if they come at the end of the year they're difficult to predict than they're going to come in the year. So it's just that simple. Having said all that, we still are really happy with the gross margin performance of the underlying product revenue. It's very strong. It won't be a headwind because of [indiscernible] ELAs year-to-year.","George Kurian","I think as Ron said Rod these ELAs are meant to make it easier for the customer to buy and they benefit from the structure of the ELAs to being able to buy more product more easily. We've always said they are choppy and hard to predict. We have deep engagements with the customers that we are structuring ELAs with. And we had we thought one in the quarter that has moved out and that's why we've also taken down the range from 2% to 1%. So we're trying to do the best we can to give you a view of what's available and we're balancing that with the probability that some of them may not happen in the year.","Rod Hall","Could you guys elaborate -- I mean you say it's one George. Is this just a few ELA deals that would have amounted to $100 million? So the $55 million maybe that's a couple of deals? Or can you give us any idea on that?","George Kurian","Listen, I think these are by nature large transactions with a very few customers, right? It's -- 1% or 2% of our total revenue is not a large number and the number of those transactions are very, very few. So each of them are lumpy, hard to predict and sizable and I'll just leave it there Rod.","Rod Hall","Okay. All right, thank you guys.","Kris Newton","Thanks Rod. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan","Hi, thank you. I know you just guided Q4, but can you give us any sense at all on how we should look at fiscal 2021? You have NAND pricing moving up again, your compares are quite easy, cloud data services seems to be doing better. Can you give us some guidepost on fiscal 2021? Talk about maybe at least some of the puts and takes on revenue and also on gross margins, if you could please?","George Kurian","Listen, let me just kind of - we're not going to guide the next fiscal year. We'll give you that guidance when we actually guide it. I could tell you that first of all the investments we are making in additional sales coverage, we are on-track against our target of 200 incremental sales headcount covering new accounts and driving customer acquisition by the end of Q1 fiscal year 2020.","It takes those sales reps roughly four quarters to get productive, so the majority of the productivity will show up next year which should drive the year-on-year model to be favorable relative to what we had this year. And we are seeing the early payoff of some of the investments, we made in acquisition accounts and acquisition districts as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, showing up positively and accelerating through the course of the year.","With regard to product gross margins as Ron mentioned, we have been maintaining strong margins across the board both on product and services reflecting the differentiation of our offerings, the work that we've done in terms of driving productivity in the business and the discipline of our sales force to capture the full value of our offerings.","And we think that regardless of the ELA picture, we have a sound business model on the gross margin side. We have been disciplined in our operating expenses. As we said, we have outlaid the sales headcount without adding to the operating expense structure of the company.","And we'll tell you more about our plans for how we continue to be disciplined on operating expenses next year. But overall the business model of the company is a strong one. I have every confidence that on the top line the investments we're making this year together with our really strong product portfolio should drive positive territory next year.","Wamsi Mohan","George, appreciate that color. If I could really quick? On the ELAs what is the hesitancy that you're seeing at the customer base particularly because they don't necessarily have to shell out the cash upfront? So why is this not an indication that they're kicking the tires around other products? Or how should people read this hesitancy around signing ELAs?","George Kurian","I think first of all with regard to our competitive position, the data that we mentioned about our ability to win new accounts and gain share in new districts proves that we have strong competitive positions.","With regard to these accounts that we are doing ELA discussions with we are deeply, deeply involved in those accounts. We've got many years of experience dealing with them and we don't see that they're headed to an alternate architecture or alternate buying motion.","I think these transactions are complex. They require coordination across many departments and the customer. We've always been transparent about the fact that they're lumpy, right? And there's very few of them.","So my own view is ELAs are 1% to 2% of our business. The majority of the business is extremely healthy. These customers that we are in discussions with we have other ways to pursue meeting their needs beyond the ELAs and we are using that in other parts of some of these accounts. So we'll tell you more as the ELAs come through and we get more visibility into some of these discussions going forward.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks Wamsi. Next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Katy Huberty","Thank you, good afternoon. Just looking at the product revenue trajectory, the decline accelerated in the January quarter, despite an easier compare, can you just talk about where you saw some of the incremental weakness in January?","George Kurian","Well I think the ELA was a contributing factor to the decline. I think, if ELA had been -- had come in I think the picture would have been quite different Katy. I think with regard to the weakness in product revenue which continues to be in the largest enterprises, as we have said those are the ones that are most affected by uncertain macroeconomic buying conditions. And we are trying to balance our exposure to those accounts by acquiring new accounts. We've seen good results from that. And hopefully those two lines should cross over at some point in the near future.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Ron, congratulations on your retirement.","Ron Pasek","Thanks Katy.","Kris Newton","Thanks Katy. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays.","Tim Long","Thank you. Congratulations as well, Ron. Yeah. George and Ron, I just wanted to ask about the Cloud Data Services business. It is kind of moving higher. But it seems like the last few quarters, you've been adding more partners that you GA add and more products and solutions.","And I think, we're at pretty much four quarters in a row where the -- kind of the sequential growth was about $10 million give or take $1 million, in that line. So, could you just talk a little bit about what you think, it will take for that line to inflect, a little bit more?","Or is it more experience with the partners or other products? Or what do you think it will be that will make that line start to move a little more aggressively higher? Thank you.","George Kurian","Thanks for the question. There are two things that we believe will allow us to move that lineup. I think the first is we continue to do enablement and training. And we are acquiring more new customers, every single day.","These workloads or applications that we serve in the public cloud, they are important applications, right? They're mission-critical applications, high-performance applications.","And so it takes a while for the customer to get comfortable with the usage of our technology, before they adopt and expand. We are seeing some of the early customers who did proof of concepts with us, started to move some workloads. And now is starting to broaden their book of business.","So that will take a little bit of ramp time. The second is, due to overwhelming demand. And the fact that operationally, we are in the early phases of a multi-region global rollout.","We have a process that we've agreed on with the hyperscale cloud provider, which is we call -- which they call white-listing, where the customer requires a registration for us to manually approve them being onboarded.","We are in a window where we're working hard to remove white-listing. And that will allow us to scale, demand more -- in a much more automated fashion. So those are the two key things that we need to get through to be able to scale it even faster.","Tim Long","Okay. And I assume we're still on track with the long-term targets here?","George Kurian","We have clearly signs of the favorable demand patterns. And as we see that the market opportunity is clearly there to get. And that's clearly our goal and intent. As we said, we are about a year behind where we wanted to be because of the time.","It's taken us to get these services to production readiness, and so we're going to continue to push to see, how we can get to that target. And we'll keep you updated on progress.","Tim Long","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Tim, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question and also congratulations Ron. It's been great working with you. I apologize to go back to this discussion. But maybe just trying to understand the math a little bit more given I think the questions I'll get is, if I look at the lumpiness in the ELA business. And I appreciate that that lumpiness will continue.","I think it's important to kind of understand, what you're saying about the gross margin. So, if I assume the ELA gross margin is close to 100%, it seems like your implicit guide on gross margin is back into the mid-65% range.","So I guess, what I'm asking is, what am I missing? And I can appreciate the mix of the business is a variable, in the April quarter. But I'm just trying to think about if ELAs aren't there, how do we think about that gross margin structure going through the course of the next couple of quarters?","Ron Pasek","So, we guided gross margin for the quarter between 66% and 67%. Last quarter for Q3, it was closer to 68%. You have a higher mix of product revenue, in Q4. That's the biggest degradation to margins.","There's a -- without going into a specific number the product margin guide employed in that, is actually higher than Q3 because of the ELA. So I think, it just -- you can't see all this. But I'm telling you it actually all holds together. So...","Aaron Rakers","Okay. And the ELA -- yeah, I know that ELA attributes there's affects that after the upfront software contributions. And actually you have some hardware-only revenue that kicks in, that has lower margins. That's not a variable at this point?","Ron Pasek","That's right. That's kind of the variable. You've got -- as I said earlier, you have a mix now. We didn't historically have a mix difference in margin between all-flash. And hybrid and now we do.","There's a big difference between, what you sell at all-flash in the margin versus hybrid. Plus, the mix of software is a wild card. So last quarter in Q3 we saw software being less of the total than we did in Q2. And that was a little bit of the degradation. So there's a lot of dynamics, going on under there.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ron Pasek","Sure.","Kris Newton","All right, thanks, Aaron. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini","Thanks for taking my questions. Ron, it was very nice working you. And good luck with your next endeavor.","George, when I look at your guide for the April quarter. And I'd just make some assumption for the all-flash array. It seems like you're going to exit FY 2020 with a high single-digit decline, in all-flash array revenues.","So as you reposition the sales force and you reload, how should we think about the embedded growth assumption for this particular area of flash array? Are we going to -- are we set out for double-digit growth? And if so, what gives you the confidence other than just hiring 200 more salespeople? And I have a follow-up.","George Kurian","I think this year the all-flash array business has been affected in two dimensions. One was the fact that our largest customers who were most impacted by the macro were heavily all-flash customers. So from a product mix perspective, the fact that our biggest accounts underperformed or bought less impacted our all-flash business more substantially than it impacted pretty much every other product in the company. The second is that the ELAs were also heavily all-flash-oriented. So both of those have been contributing factors to the year-on-year declines in the all-flash category.","We expect the work that we're doing with the deployment of additional sales force, resources as well as focusing our compensation plans and our sales objectives on returning to growth in the all-flash category to be able to drive our business at and above market growth rates. And we'll tell you more about that as we issue the FY 2021 guide. But we are taking actions to focus our sales force on the best-in-class product in the all-flash category which is ours right? And we have every confidence that we should be able to meet or beat the market next year.","Mehdi Hosseini","Sure. And a quick follow-up. I understand ELAs have a material impact on product margin. But excluding ELA, NAND prices are going to go up and they're going to go up much higher than where they are today. So how are you able to manage product gross margin independent of ELA? Because I perceive ELAs as volatile and there's no way I could model that. So I just want to think about the increase in bill of material and how you're going to be able to manage that?","Ron Pasek","So Mehdi, two things: number one is as you saw this quarter I think quarter-to-quarter NAND prices went up about 4% and have a very minimal effect on our gross margin, because contrary to popular belief not a big huge portion of the COGS in our system is actually NAND, right? A lot of it's software, a lot of it's other parts. So I think what you should see this year is -- you're right, this year we should project to see NAND go up, but it won't have a huge material effect on gross margin because there's a lot of other components.","Mehdi Hosseini","And is that because you're able to -- that there's another replacement cycle coming? Is there a premium? Because on the margin NAND is going higher. I understand NAND is a small portion, but it's still going higher.","George Kurian","Listen I think first of all for the drives in our platforms we typically pass the cost on to our customers, right? I think NAND is not an embedded component of our system, it is a consumable that we pass on to customers and so we don't try to mask the commodities in terms of the drives in our system. And so there will be -- at some point, as the market adjusts upward, if that is the trajectory, we're going to be discrete about making sure that we pass on some of that to our customers, right? And so we've had that history. I think the industry as a whole has had that history. And we'll disclose it when we do it, right?","I think with regard to product gross margins they've been strong this year and even without ELAs because of the fact that our sales force has been enabled and we know how to sell the value of our offerings. A substantial portion of that value is actually software that both makes our systems the most efficient in the industry, but also allows our customers to uniquely take advantage of hybrid cloud capability that nobody else in the industry has. And so we are differentiated in software. That's proven out in the ability to hold gross margins in a tough economic environment.","Mehdi Hosseini","Clear. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Great. Thanks, Mehdi. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse.","Matt Cabral","Yeah. Thank you. George, can you just talk a little bit about the wider demand environment that you're seeing and if it's changed at all versus the prior few quarters? And then I guess given it's been about a year since you've been calling out macro as a headwind what gives you confidence that these larger deals are just actually being pushed as opposed to either competitive losses or some sort of a secular shift in customers thinking about their on-prem footprint more broadly?","George Kurian","So we saw the first signs of the macro being a little bit more choppy was about a year ago in January. We saw a substantial step-down from that level of uncertainty into a much more sort of uncertain environment in Q1. I think from Q1 -- of our fiscal Q1. I think from then on it's stayed relatively in the same territory. I wouldn't say it has gotten worse. It is reflective of three or four key things. I think the first is buying cycles are longer and the amount of spend per transaction is smaller. I think we have consistently seen a higher rate and number of transactions across a broader range of accounts, especially as we've added sales capacity through the year. And so, that's indications that we can win in net new accounts, but that the average transaction size is more muted.","You also see the fact as we've said where people are buying for now versus buying capacity for the long-term. Even though you hand people incentives to buy a larger transaction, they're more sort of comfortable buying for the short-term. Those are some of the key things.","With regard to what gives us confidence that we can return to growth, listen I think first of all, we have relatively easy compares in the first half of next year. We've put in capacity ahead of that window to get our sales teams productive.","We've got work to do to enable all the 200 that we put in place. But the results from the new deployments of resources in terms of customer wins, units, sales volume, use cases, have all been really encouraging.","With regard to these large customers that we are engaged with, we have deep relationships with them. We know when they're making an architectural choice to go to the cloud, because we are an intimate part of those cloud discussions with many.","And frankly, as we said in our prepared remarks, some of them going to cloud might be a near-term hindrance to revenue growth, but they give us a much broader revenue opportunity in the medium-term, right? We mentioned the Fortune 10 company, which as they've moved to cloud has given us a maybe 3 to 4 times larger opportunity than we had on premises. And so, we're excited about that opportunity in those accounts that are choosing to move to cloud.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks, Matt. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.","Ananda Baruah","Good afternoon, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. Ron, from me as well congratulations, it's been great working with you. Really enjoyed it.","Ron Pasek","Thank you. Appreciate that.","Ananda Baruah","Yeah. You're welcome. George, I know you just said that you don't -- at least broadly speaking you don't think that you're seeing the spending environment get more challenging. Could you -- like, if I back out the ELAs from the strategic revenue, you put up slightly sort of more favorable declines in the Jan quarter, but it was off a meaningfully easier compare. And so, I don't know. The numbers seem to suggest that like maybe there is some incremental interference in the spending environment. So, I just want to run that by you and just make sure that I understood your comment accurately.","And then, I'm just going to add one more in there too. Do you feel like with the new sales force ramp-on that you're where you -- from a productivity perspective, that you're where you want it to be at this point? If you could update us there. Just I think we're all just looking for kind of context around the -- not just the product revenue, but the strategic product revenue spending dynamic sense.","George Kurian ","Listen, I think that we're seeing the environment is choppy, right? We are seeing that customer spending, enterprise IT spending for on-premises data centers is choppy and that has been true for a few quarters now. Do I have enough data to say, it's a shade better or a shade worse? I don't have that data right? I'm just saying it is pretty choppy and uncertain.","I think with regard to the sales force productivity, we've always said it's between three and four quarters, roughly four quarters for a new account manager to be fully trained and equipped and ready. We said that we would be adding increments of 50 headcount starting in Q2 of fiscal year 2020 and finishing at the end of Q1 fiscal year 2021. So we would have four chunks of that.","We are on track with the hiring, and we're working hard on enablement, right? And so, I think if you do the math the majority of the productivity impact of that headcount is actually next fiscal year. And listen, we'd love to move the productivity impact earlier and we're doing everything we can, but I think that's where you should reasonably model it.","Ananda Baruah","Okay. Okay, great. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Ananda. Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.","Matt Sheerin","Yes. Thank you. I wanted to ask about any potential impact you're seeing from the coronavirus in your supply chain, given that most of your key suppliers are in Asia, in China. So, any constraints there? Or given that you're still early in the quarter, and you tend to be more back-end loaded by the time you get through the quarter that shouldn't be an issue?","George Kurian","Listen, our Q4 revenue guide does not include any disruption to our supply chain from the coronavirus. So far, two elements of our business and their potential impact on coronavirus, right? On the demand side, we don't have a large business in China. We, as you know, prosecute that business through a joint venture with Lenovo, who are the distributors of our technology in China. Our customers are -- do large amounts of business in China, so I would model on the demand side that our impact to us is a second-order derivative, right? With regard to the supply side, with regard to our supply chain, yes, we like others have supply base that is built \u2013 that has a meaningful footprint in China. And we are working pretty hard on contingency planning to minimize disruptions. So far, we have not seen any, but I think there's probably likely some and we're working hard to minimize that.","Matt Sheerin","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats Ron on your retirement. I'm thinking you might have a future as a NAND analyst going forward. You may not like the job. In terms of questions, I was just curious this may be in the rounding of the numbers but it looks like sales through channel the channel were a little weaker year-over-year. I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about that? And also a similar question on the public sector markets was there any changes relative to your expectations there? It seemed like it came off a regular sort of end to the \u2013 their October fiscal year? Thank you.","Ron Pasek","So with respect to the mix of channel, I mean, that vacillates \u2013 it's usually 80\/20 as vacillates around that mean. There's nothing underlying there that was \u2013 is permanent or unusual.","Steven Fox","Okay. Thanks.","George Kurian","With regard to the public sector business mostly performed according to plan. I think we saw a pretty normal pattern of business in our public sector.","Steven Fox","And just as a follow-up to that any initiatives to sort of maybe reaccelerate your business there? I know, one of your smaller competitors has been focusing on that area. Do you see that as a threat? Or is this more just tied to general budgets?","George Kurian","Listen, I think we have a variety of ways to broaden our relevance in the public sector. We are working with some of our cloud provider partners to be part of their initiatives and to serve our men and women in uniform in new and interesting ways. So we'll tell you more about that as we bring those to market.","Steven Fox","Okay. Thank you very much.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Steve. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.","Jim Suva","Thanks very much. George, if I remember right, it was approximately six months ago you'd mentioned about increasing sales force by 200 and you mentioned it again. I was just wondering, is the tempo or the cadence of that going faster than expected in line with expected slower than expected? Because what I'm trying to do is figure out the softer guidance. Is it being impacted at all by that sales force transition? Or is it more macro and just longer decision-making time lines? Thank you so much.","George Kurian","With regard to the sales force, we said that we would add 200 incremental sales resources to allow us to acquire new customers. We laid that out in four quarters sort of saying that we would start in Q2 of fiscal \u2013 of this fiscal year and finish at the end of Q1 of fiscal year 2021, and we are on track. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are bringing good candidates on board and we are generally on track. We also said that it would take a typical new sales rep about four quarters to get productive. So if you do the math, the majority of the benefits of that investment really are next year, right?","With regard to Q4, the change or the softness is really for us being a little bit more conservative on ELAs going from previously what we thought would be 2% down to 1% maybe a shade below 1% in that range, right? And so I think that's the majority of the change between what you saw previously and what you see now.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much for the clarifications and detail that's greatly appreciated. And Ron we'll greatly miss you.","Ron Pasek","Thank you. Appreciate it, Jim.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Jim. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.","Simon Leopold","Thank you for taking the question and Ron congratulations on the retirement. I wanted to see if we can maybe talk about your overall philosophy regarding return of capital. You've been buying back a lot of stock another $500 million this quarter paying a good dividend over $100 million. And so you've been exceeding your free cash flow and you're almost out of the authorized $600 million. So I assume you're going to update us on that at some point. But I guess what I'm trying to get to is the long-term philosophy. And does the transition of CFO mean that you'll want to wait for the new CFO to set a philosophy? Or how are you thinking? Thank you.","Ron Pasek","Well, yeah, I think it's going to coincide with the change in the fiscal year, when we give the guide. Obviously, we'll give some clarity around what would happen to the capital allocation policy. But the dividend is permanent that's not going to change. If anything it's going to go up as we proceed from here on out. And to your point, we're almost done with the $4 billion share repurchase. So you could see that getting to an end fairly soon and the company will probably re-clarify what the next tranche will be going forward. And I'll let my successor determine that with George.","George Kurian","I'll just say that Ron and I have had a common philosophy and a shared one around the sources and uses of cash. I don't think you should see a radical departure from our belief that cash is an important asset for both investing in the long-term health of the business and in terms of providing returns to shareholders. So, I don't think that you should see us make a radical departure from that philosophy going forward.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thank you. That's helpful.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks Simon. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital Markets.","Lou Miscioscia","Okay. Thank you. Ron, best of luck it's good having you. So, I wanted to just and I went back further 10 years, but really want to focus on the last seven years. If I take out the ELAs for the quarter just to look at product revenue on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the average growth is actually about $39 million if I'm getting this all right.","And with that four out of the last seven actually were material misses and the other three were just basically hitting let's say $73 million to $77 million quarter-to-quarter. So, I guess, I'd be just a little worried on even this lower product revenue taking out ELAs. So, again, given the choppy environment and all the uncertainty, why would we -- why would you be able to hit that midpoint?","George Kurian","You're talking about Q4?","Lou Miscioscia","Q4 over Q3, yes, sequential growth of product revenue to get to the -- if I'm modeling very easily software maintenance and services, I don't think they're hard to model. And thus when I look at product revenue, I take out the $50 million, again, it seems like your average was $39 million quarter-to-quarter.","George Kurian","So, Q4 has always been the strongest quarter in terms of a year-end finish for our sales force. I think we have done a good amount of work in terms of looking at our pipeline. And we're not saying that the guide isn't requires really good execution and it doesn't require disruption due to coronavirus or anything else.","But I think that we're counting on the fact that we are at the end of a fiscal year and Q4 is the quarter that those sales reps that are in the money are going to bring in transactions, right? I think that's the short summary.","I think like all plans we go into the quarter looking at our pipeline looking at close rates looking at how many transactions that are high probability medium probability low probability are required to get in these numbers and we've done that work. It is a choppy environment. And so we've tried to be cautious around the probabilities, but we've done -- we're doing as much due diligence as we can with regard to the quality of the bookings forecast that we give you.","Lou Miscioscia","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks Lou. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street Capital Markets.","Eric Martinuzzi","Yes, you've given us some good clarity on the sales hiring effort. I was just curious where did our headcount finish up for January 31st? And where do you expect it ending the fiscal year?","Ron Pasek","So, it was roughly flat. It hasn't changed all that much. We -- you know we haven't been in a hiring mode except on the salesforce side. We're holding OpEx essentially flat this fiscal year. Some of that is variable comp, but it obviously implies that we're not adding a lot of people just in certain areas and rather surgically.","Eric Martinuzzi","Okay. You guys normally have a college hiring cycle that would probably bring on people in Q1. Are you continuing to pursue that or are you -- has that been kind of suspended?","Ron Pasek","No, that's ongoing.","Eric Martinuzzi","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks Eric. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research.","Nik Todorov","Hi guys. Good afternoon. George we're continuing -- we're hearing that HCI Systems are displacing more and more traditional servers and storage systems. So, I get that that suggests that the market could be moving to that enterprise scale applications that your product addresses. But can you provide us with your outlook for 2020 in terms of -- do you expect to see an inflection in your HCI revenue in the next year?","George Kurian","Listen HCI addresses some of the use cases in the customers' data center, particularly ones that are single application use. I think that we have a good offering. It's differentiated for mixed workloads and has several elements for customers who require good data management capabilities even in a single application use. And we're focusing our efforts in HCI in that part of the market.","We don't see HCI displacing sort of the core of solid-state storage right? I think fiber channel storage as well as high-performance scale-out NFS storage has still got actually many, many applications in the data center. And our original view that HCI might displace those isn't being proven true. And I think you'll see us push aggressively with our flash and hybrid flash products to address those use cases.","Nik Todorov","Got it. If I can follow up just quickly are you willing to share what percent of customers are still at a proof-of-concept stage with CDS?","George Kurian","No, it's too early to comment on that. I think I would just tell you the majority of our customers today on CDS are in early production, right? So, they're in -- you could say they're in proof-of-concept of their first application deployment on our platform. And they might be in production on that application, but that's the first of many. They want to move to that platform.","So broadly speaking, until we sort of remove ungated demand, which is removing what we call white-listing, every customer is in sort of a proof-of-concept mode. And once we remove that, you should be able to see much more automated onboarding of customers to that platform.","Nick Todorov","Got it. Thanks guys. Good luck Ron.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Nick. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.","George Iwanyc","Thank you for taking my question. And best of luck Ron. George, could you maybe give us a bit more color on trends in North America? Are there any areas where you're seeing market share gains from a workload perspective? Are you starting to see any benefit from the streamlined purchasing model?","George Kurian","I think with regard to the use of consumption and consumption-based offerings we see that our cloud data services plus managed services from partners are really good opportunities for customers to get going with us in a consumption offering. I think we made our subscription type model available. We're seeing early interest that's very healthy, and we are working with a small group of customers on proof-of-concepts getting them on board and going from there.","With regard to the streamlined pricing and packaging of our platforms, I think that's a big part of why product gross margins continue to be healthy, right? I think that customers are able to understand the value that we offer in a much more streamlined way than we historically used to. And so it's another support element for product gross margins helping our sales force establish value with customers.","With regard to some of the shifts we see going on in the market, as I mentioned, we are participating with the hyperscaler cloud providers in new market opportunities and especially in the public sector market. We'll tell you more about it as those become real, but they expand our total addressable market opportunity in a way that we didn't before.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks, George. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim.","Nehal Chokshi","Yeah. Thank you. The year-over-year trajectory on the hardware maintenance went from declining mid single-digits to flat. Is there a narrative behind that?","Ron Pasek","Yeah. So actually if you remember even in Q1 and Q2 adjusting for currency, we were flat. This quarter it's up about 5%. What I tried to put in my prepared remarks and we've actually started to see the benefits of some of the work, we've been doing on renewals, so it's finally starting to pay off. Better renewal rates, better structures, better pricing, better discounting, so you'll have to wait until next year, but that's actually a bright spot that trend line is actually in really good shape.","Nehal Chokshi","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks Nehal. I'm going to pass it back to George for some final comments.","George Kurian","Our Data Fabric strategy is creating value for our customers NetApp and our investors. Only NetApp has the strategy the innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multi-cloud IT. All these integration with the leading public clouds and industry-leading technology for on-premises storage solutions gives us a sustainable competitive advantage.","We'll continue our strong focus on operational discipline, which enables us to make the strategic investments in sales coverage, customer experience and hybrid multi-cloud solutions needed to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. We are seeing early signs of success by getting in front of more customers, which gives me confidence that our investments will pay off in future growth.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.","I would like to turn the call over to your host, Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kris Newton","Hello, and thank you for joining us on our Q2 fiscal year 2015 earnings call. With me today are CEO, Tom Georgens; and CFO, Nick Noviello.","This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our Web site at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2015, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections.","Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We described some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on a Form 8-K. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2014, subsequent Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our current reports on Form 8-K also on file with the SEC and available on our Web site.","During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release and on our Web site.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom for his commentary on the quarter.","Tom Georgens","Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased with our performance in Q2. Revenue and non-GAAP EPS were both above the midpoint of our prior guidance range and we had another strong quarter of gross margin performance. The growth of large deals we saw in Q1 continued into Q2, helped by our U.S. public sector business.","The rapid adoption of Clustered Data ONTAP, the industry\u2019s number one storage operating system continued in Q2 with shipments of Clustered nodes more than tripling year-over-year. The attach rate of Clustered ONTAP again increased across all of our product lines. The attach rate to our high-end platforms was 65%. For the midrange, it was 50% and we are seeing acceleration in the low-end with attach rates more than doubling from Q1.","Total system unit shipped increased 6% from Q2 last year. We saw notable strength in E-Series branded and all-flash FAS. FlexPod, our converged architecture solution also continues to perform well with shipments up 50% from last year. We continue to see momentum with our broad portfolio of flash solutions as well. In Q2, our flash capacity shipped more than doubled year-over-year and we shipped FlashRay, our newest all-flash array to select customers.","Before I talk more about our strategy and provide some insights into how it is resonating with customers, I\u2019ll pass it over to Nick to provide details on our Q2 results. Nick?","Nick Noviello","Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. NetApp delivered another quarter of solid financial performance. As Tom highlighted, we achieved net revenues and EPS above the midpoint of our prior guidance ranges and are pleased with the adoption and momentum of NetApp\u2019s portfolio of innovations.","Fiscal Q2 net revenues were $1.54 billion, up 4% sequentially and roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. Product revenue of $929 million was down 3% year-over-year while the combination of software entitlements and maintenance and services revenues of $613 million was up 3% year-over-year. NetApp branded revenue was 92% of net revenues for Q2 and at $1.42 billion was up 5% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year.","OEM revenue of $119 million declined 8% sequentially and 22% from Q2 last year. Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs accounted for 80% of Q2 net revenues and was down from Q2 last year, due to declines in OEM business. Excluding OEM, indirect revenue was roughly flat year-over-year.","Arrow and Avent contributed 24% and 17% of net revenues, respectively. Geographic performance came in largely as expected and included a 51% sequential and 8% year-over-year increase in U.S. public sector revenues corresponding to the fiscal year end of the U.S. government.","Non-GAAP gross margin of 65% was up 1.4 points from Q2 last year and above our prior guidance range. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 58.4% was up more than a point year-over-year benefiting from a combination of supply chain savings, favorable product mix and lower warranty costs. Service gross margin of 62.7% was slightly higher than anticipated due to a combination of higher support revenues and lower than expected spending on support infrastructure.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 17.8% in line with our previous guidance. We continue to invest selectively across the business to bring our innovative data management solutions for the hybrid cloud to customers. Consistent with our expectations, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 16.5%.","Q2 weighted average diluted share count of 323 million shares was below our prior guidance, down 6 million shares sequentially and down 26 million shares or 7% from Q2 last year, due to continued stock repurchase activity. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 was in line with our prior guidance range.","Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and investments, 16% of which is onshore. The sequential decrease in onshore cash was predominately due to shares repurchased in the quarter. Inventory turns were at 20 and days sales outstanding were 37. Deferred revenue of $3 billion was up $115 million from Q2 last year. Q2 cash from operations was $381 million versus $363 million in Q2 FY '14. Free cash flow was 21% of revenue in Q2 consistent with last year.","In Q2, we returned $652 million to shareholders, $600 million in share repurchases and $52 million in cash dividends. Consistent with the guidance we provided this past May, we remain on track to complete our share repurchase program by the end of May 2015. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.165 per share of the company\u2019s stock to be paid on January 22, 2015.","Now to guidance. We remain pleased with the momentum we see building in the business, but must remain conscious of the macro and industry dynamics as we continue to operate in a challenging environment. In Q3, we expect to bear the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange particularly the euro, which will have a negative impact on both sequential and year-over-year growth of about a point. As a result, our target revenue range for fiscal Q3 is $1.56 billion to $1.66 billion, which at the midpoint implies about 4% sequential growth and roughly flat revenue year-over-year.","We expect fiscal Q3 non-GAAP gross margins to range from approximately 64% to 64.5% and non-GAAP operating margins to range from approximately 18% to 18.5%. Diluted share count for the quarter is expected to be approximately 320 million shares based on share repurchase activity in Q2 and in the first 10 days of Q3.","We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q3 to range from approximately $0.74 to $0.79 per share. Our guidance reflects just over $0.02 of dilution from the combination of unfavorable foreign exchange as well as the net operating expenses related to the SteelStore product line acquisition, which closed at the beginning of Q3.","As we move into the second half of the year, our overall fiscal 2015 revenue and EPS expectations remain unchanged. However, given the industry transition we continue to navigate through, we do expect some shift in the revenue mix with branded revenue growth for the year to be slightly lower than and a decline in OEM revenue to be less than our original expectations.","Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix and growth, we expect non-GAAP gross margin just about 64% and non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 18% for fiscal 2015. We continue to expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be about 16.5%.","Full year non-GAAP EPS will reflect the net impact of foreign exchange for at least Q3, as well as about $0.03 of dilution from the SteelStore product line acquisition in the second half. Finally, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and as I indicated earlier remain on track to complete our existing share repurchase plan by the end of May 2015.","In closing, we remain confident in our execution, our plans for the remainder of FY '15 and our long-term strategy. Our strong portfolio of solutions is well aligned with the evolving priorities of our customers. NetApp is uniquely positioned to help customers as they navigate the transformation of their IT deployments by providing a bridge from the choices of today to their requirements for the future.","Now, I would like to turn the call back to Tom for some additional thoughts on our vision and how it aligns to customer priorities. Tom?","Tom Georgens","Thanks, Nick. Two weeks ago, we held one of my favorite events, our annual technical conference, NetApp Insight. The energy level is always very high and in recent years, Insight has more turning points in the acceleration of products like Clustered ONTAP, branded E-Series and OnCommand Insight. This year for the first time, we invited customers. The excitement and endorsement of our technology and vision was remarkable. We highlighted our differentiated vision for the hybrid cloud as well as new software services and partnerships that support this vision.","In just the past 90 days, we have introduced a significant number of new product offerings, including Data ONTAP 8.3, Cloud ONTAP, FlashRay, StorageGRID Webscale, expanded partnerships from NetApp private storage and the SteelStore product line acquisition. Many of these are the culminations of years of effort all coming together at the same time. We have never had a stronger portfolio of innovative solutions and never have been more impactful in creating great outcomes for our customers\u2019 businesses.","We are pleased with our competitive position and performance in the first half of the year, but as Nick noted earlier, it\u2019s important to recognize that we continue to operate in a challenging environment. We have all seen the headlines of macroeconomic uncertainties; Russia, the European economy, FX headwinds, but more fundamentally our industry is in transition. Enterprises must manage their existing infrastructure and meet the growing demands of the business while at the same time adopting new technologies and delivery options.","Cloud plays a key role in creating value for enterprise customers and we want to accelerate their ability to realize that value. There are compelling used cases for the cloud and there are workloads where our own infrastructure will be the preferred choice. Because of this, hybrid cloud will be the ultimate model with enterprise as having some element of traditional cloud, hyperscale cloud and on-premises computing in their IT environments. A hybrid model means that the cloud cannot be an island separate from everything else. The true value of the cloud can only be realized as a seamless extension of on-premises computing where two technologies integrate with the existing, mature, proven and compliance systems.","Data is at the center of the hybrid cloud. It has a lifecycle that needs to be shared and integrated to deliver business value. Unfortunately, there is not one cloud. Today\u2019s clouds are a range of isolated, incompatible silos. To truly operationalize the cloud, customers need a way to converge the different data management environments between their clouds and their on-premise infrastructure. Our NetApp data fabric vision provides customers with the only consistent way to manage, secure and protect their data regardless of where they chose to put it. The NetApp data fabric weaves together to disparate data elements of the hybrid cloud into a single architecture giving customers control and choice with the flexibility, elasticity and ubiquity of cloud resources.","Data ONTAP is the foundation of the NetApp data fabric. Clustered Data ONTAP delivers true software-defined functionality with a set of enterprise-wide data management capabilities independent of the underlying hardware. Clustered ONTAP enables customers to grow incrementally and non-disruptively with the flexibility of a wide range of deployment options; from converged and integrated systems to third-party arrays as well as software only and cloud options.","With the latest major upgrade of Clustered ONTAP, we have made huge improvements across virtually everything criteria on which customers evaluate store solutions; performance, scalability, availability and efficiency. We dramatically increased our performance for flash getting all-flash FAS arrays performance levels ahead of our new entrants. We enhanced availability with the introduction of Metrocluster. We improved efficiency with in line pattern removal and advanced drive partitioning techniques, and we continue to simplify the customer experience of migration from both legacy NetApp and competing environments.","By combining the elasticity and flexibility of cloud computing with the data management capabilities of Clustered ONTAP, the NetApp private storage solution set enables enterprises to take advantage of the cloud while minimizing risk. Customers can realize the flexibility and economic benefits of multi-cloud solutions without the risk and regulatory concerns associated with relinquishing data stewardship. The NetApp private storage solution ecosystem includes Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and our latest addition, IBM SoftLayer. Enterprises now really have a choice of cloud providers and the ability to select based on costs, performance and service levels.","Cloud ONTAP extends the value of Clustered ONTAP into the cloud. Cloud ONTAP uses patented NetApp technologies for non-disruptive operations, seamless scalability and efficiency combining them with on-demand computing benefits of cloud services in a pay-as-you-go model. The initial release combines the world\u2019s leading storage operating system ONTAP with the world\u2019s leading public cloud Amazon Web Services. We have been in beta for several months with installed base customers and today announced its general availability.","NetApp private storage and Cloud ONTAP demonstrate our commitment to enable customers to fully realize the flexibility and economics of hyperscale clouds and to do so as a seamless extension of their on-premises environment. NetApp creates the ability to leverage the instant scale of the cloud to accelerate time to deployment of new applications, to reduce the risk in investment for temporary or speculative workloads and to transfer high activity workloads back to owned infrastructure for better economics. Hybrid cloud done correctly means better speed, innovation and economics with greater responsiveness to the needs of the business.","Cloud also makes sense to low utilization workloads like backup and archiving. Enterprises are looking for more cost effective ways to manage this data and are considering cloud storage as an option. To that end, we recently acquired the SteelStore product line from Riverbed, which enables customers to extend their existing data protection infrastructure into the cloud. Customers are able to reduce the complexity of disc-to-disc and tape-based backup while reducing storage costs with in-line deduplication and compression.","Today, we announced the availability of the SteelStore product as well as an Amazon machine image option, which will be available later this quarter. To help customers manage large scale data repositories, we recently introduced StorageGRID Webscale which automatically stores and manages repositories of billions of objects globally across multiple data centers, clouds and cost tiers. Customers can define policies that automate how and where data is stored and protected based on cost, performance, accessibility and durability needs. Additionally, because StorageGRID Webscale is built for the hybrid cloud, organizations can store data in the right place, at the right time and take advantage of on-premises or public cloud environments as need dictate with the ability to move back and forth dynamically.","All of these innovations support our vision of a fully operationalized hybrid cloud. Unlike the positioning of other suppliers, we are not diminishing the potential of a hyperscale cloud nor are we steering customers to a proprietary cloud. We are unambiguously stating that for important subset of workloads the hyperscale cloud will deliver value to our customers. Our strategy is to enable customers to realize that value by making hyperscale integration to existing environments as seamless and operationally secure as possible. Our portfolio of data management solutions improves the economics, flexibility and business impact of customers existing infrastructure while giving them confidence in our ability to help them navigate the hybrid cloud future.","In the last few months, we have dramatically expanded the NetApp portfolio at a pace unprecedented in our history. We introduced Data ONTAP 8.3, Cloud ONTAP, FlashRay, StorageGRID Webscale, expanded NetApp private storage and FlexPod solution ecosystems and acquired the SteelStore product line. We expect each of these products to lead in their categories prevailing over competitors both large and small. Our best of breed solutions are compelling for existing requirements and are integrated to a much broader vision of the hybrid cloud that only NetApp can deliver. The integration of the public cloud is driving a fundamental transformation of IT creating more opportunities for IT to deliver competitive advantage for the businesses than ever before. But these opportunities come with risk. Our vision supported by products that are available now is fueling our participation and leadership in this transition. Only NetApp has a strategy that gives customers a seamless path to the hybrid cloud and the ability to manage their data across clouds and on-premises environments.","Before opening the call for Q&A, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the over 12,000 employees of NetApp for all their work and dedication. We, again, received strong placement in the World\u2019s Best Multinational Workplaces list by the Great Place to Work Institute. NetApp\u2019s unique culture is a differentiator that helps us produce great results for NetApp customers and partners.","We will now open up the call for Q&A. As always, I ask you to be respectful of your peers on the call and limit yourself to one question, so we can address as many people as possible. Thank you. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Yes. Thank you. Tom, I wanted to go with you, if I could, and if you could just talk a little bit about the branded product revenue and that if I impute what you\u2019re guiding to, it looks like you\u2019re guiding to about mid single digit branded product revenue, which is the first time that you would reach mid single digits in I think 10 or 12 quarters than kind of plus or minus zero. And yet it sounds like, to be fair, you\u2019re down taking a little bit on your expectations associated with branded product revenue and I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about why you think your growth potential is lower than what you had previously expected?","Tom Georgens","Yes. I think all things considered, I think things are more or less in line of what we expected. I\u2019d say the thing that\u2019s probably a variance certainly going into this quarter is really the impact of FX. And the FX impact is overwhelmingly on the branded side as opposed to the OEM side given the nature of that business. So I think the trajectory that we talked about for the branded business I think is very, very much intact. It\u2019s certainly modulated by the FX component, so I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re communicating anything different than what we\u2019ve been saying all along. I think the momentum is there. Certainly the portfolio build just in the last 90 days, you think about the products we just brought to market, literally it will take time to ramp but if I look at the trajectory that we\u2019re on, it\u2019s substantially unchanged. I really don\u2019t have anything to add to the equation expect for the FX impact, which is overwhelmingly on branded.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Okay. So literally, it was just FX then.","Tom Georgens","Yes. A point is a real number in a low growth market, so for us if we had that point back, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be having this discussion.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Okay.","Nick Noviello","Keith, I\u2019m going to add in on that just for everybody else as well. In terms of the Q3 guidance, it is that point of FX that is really from a revenue perspective and we both had calls earlier certainly on the press side of the fence and really on Q3, it\u2019s FX. That\u2019s it in terms of any difference from what we would have expected earlier. And then on the EPS line, you need to think about the SteelStore acquisition and the combination of those two on the EPS line is about $0.02.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","All right, fair enough, because you\u2019re certainly not the only company experiencing FX challenges.","Nick Noviello","Correct.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","If I could just sneak in why the corresponding question and as my follow up is you mentioned the OEM business is a little bit better. Should we be thinking about the same longer term considerations for the FX as a percent of total revenues or product revenues? Is this a temporary little bit better or do you think there are some larger opportunities here associated with the OEM business? That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Nick Noviello","Yes, so let me start on that and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to keep the one question thing. But on the OEM side of the fence, most of that business is conducted in U.S. dollars. So we don\u2019t have too much of an FX impact there to think about. It\u2019s mostly on the branded side, as Tom indicated. And we said that the OEM business could be off up to 40% this year. It\u2019s obviously not at that point so far for the first half. This is dynamic as business declines and in certain areas business is declining substantially and significantly and you can think about the N series business as the perfect example of that. There\u2019s other businesses that we expected some pretty substantial declines on and are a little bit lumpy on the way down. So those are all things we have to think about. And so as we modulate these branded and OEM numbers just a little bit, we\u2019re being conscious of those things.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Many thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is open.","Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group","I\u2019d like to dig more into Cloud ONTAP. You spent a lot of time on that, I appreciate that. But the realization of cloud bursting, I want to be clear. Is that something that is enabled within this current version of general availability or is that something that will become available? And I have a follow up based on that answer.","Tom Georgens","We want to keep to one, so \u2013 one question. I think Cloud ONTAP is ONTAP and so depending on your definition of cloud bursting, effectively what it\u2019s going to look like is another instantiation of an ONTAP system. So all of the way that you would manage a system that was on-premise running ONTAP, this would just look like an actual extension of that. So all the SnapMirror technology, all the data moving technology, the multiprotocol, all of those are built into this application. So if cloud bursting is can I run an application here and then can I run instantiation on it in the cloud and can I move my data over with SnapMirror, the answer to that is yes.","Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group","Okay. What I\u2019m precisely talking about is that say you have a highly variable workload and you don\u2019t want to buy physical resources on-premise for the baseline and that you want to burst it into the public cloud for the peak workloads. Can you do that?","Tom Georgens","The answer to that is yes. However, in general you\u2019re going to want the applications in relatively close proximity to the data. So if you had two copies of that data that would be viable, or if you had an application that run for a long time and you can move the data and then run the application. Probably a better alternative to that is actually NetApp private storage. What NetApp private storage is, is you basically have the data on your network and you connect to the high bandwidth pipes to Amazon and Microsoft and now SoftLayer.","So effectively you can have one copy of the data and execute on it with your internal computing capabilities and if you need extra compute capabilities on that same piece of data on your network, you can have access to the elastic compute of Amazon, Microsoft or SoftLayer. So in that latter situation, I think that\u2019s a better match for the used case that you decide. There are other used cases for Cloud ONTAP like backup and DR and things of that nature. So I\u2019d say that we have all of those used cases covered in a very, very unique and differentiated way and that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much momentum around this cloud story and a lot of response from the Insight that we just did last week.","Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group","Right. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Thanks. Nick, I was hoping you could provide a little detail about what you\u2019re thinking about gross margins longer term? They were a bit better than expected and I know that you called out supply chain savings and some favorable mix. In this quarter, guidance looks a little bit lower in terms of gross margin expectations. Just wanted to get more detail on how we should think about it longer term?","Nick Noviello","Sure, Sherri. I think that in terms of longer term being the year, first, we took that up a bit and you probably noticed that in the text this time versus last time around. In terms of the three-year, the gross margin guidance is really unchanged. We\u2019re getting benefit from a variety of things we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re getting benefit from mix of business, mix of revenue in the business. So as we have higher margin, pieces of our services businesses higher margin that rolling through that\u2019s going to benefit us. OEM mix will change things as well.","But as we\u2019ve talked about in prior quarters, we have done a substantial amount of work that we feel good about around the supply chain side of the fence. We\u2019re also seeing the benefit of warranty that\u2019s speaking to other things that we have worked very hard on over time. So I think that this all comes together and is consistent. We in essence brought up the year a little bit in the gross margin side, so FY '15, so you should expect to see that in the second half here. But the overall guidance and the overall expectations of strong gross margins based on that value proposition of what we\u2019re selling is consistent.","Tom Georgens","One thing I\u2019d add is certainly I\u2019d echo Nick\u2019s comments. I think the execution intensity of the company on many fronts, including this one in terms of gross margin generation and likewise engineering and delivery I think had ratchet up dramatically over the course of the last couple of years. But the other thing in terms of long-term guidance on gross margin is, we reserve the right to use that as a competitive knob. We certainly see aging infrastructures of our competitors out there that are not really being refreshed and not really seeing any innovation.","And the opportunity to attack them aggressively with now a refreshed Clustered ONTAP and the new offerings that we have and generally a lot of those attacks are not our highest margin transactions on day one. So the ability to use the gross margin strength of the company as a competitive weapon to attack aging infrastructures of our competition is something that we\u2019re going to reserve the right to do. So as we think about our long-term gross margin, not only is it the operational excellence that Nick and the team are driving but it\u2019s also the competitive choices that we\u2019re going to make.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Thank you, Tom. And can I just ask a follow up in terms of the\u2026","Tom Georgens","This is the third follow up. I think we probably need to keep it fair, otherwise we won\u2019t get to the entire list. I\u2019m sorry.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. How are you thinking about federal trends now as we head into the January quarter after obviously a nice rebound this quarter? Should it be normal seasonal declines? And I guess related to that, do you think your visibility here is now improving to normal levels or is it still a bit lumpy?","Nick Noviello","Yes. So why don\u2019t I start on the seasonal decline. So, yes, we expect seasonal declines and in fact they are substantial. In many years we\u2019ve had a Q2 to Q3 sequential decline in federal revenues in the 40% range plus. So we would expect that same thing again. And that doesn\u2019t mean we feel good, better and different. It\u2019s just the seasonality of the business. I think that we have seen stabilization out there, that\u2019s good. I think our position \u2013 and Tom can speak to it better than I, our position continues to be very strong on the federal side of the fence.","Tom Georgens","Certainly a year ago we were facing sequestration at the end of the government\u2019s fiscal year and then a shutdown in the month of October when trying to close a quarter. So obviously compared to that, it was a lot more pleasant but frankly it was \u2013 I think the team did a really good job there. I would say that federal spending wasn\u2019t massively robust but nonetheless it was much more predictable and much more understandable. And with the 8% year-over-year growth better than on the booking side, I think there\u2019s no doubt that we gained share in that segment.","The team continues to execute well. I think going forward, I think that traditional seasonality from quarter-to-quarter is what we would expect. Obviously a change in Congress may have some impact on the funding side but absent that, I think that the federal business pretty much operated on its normal cadence through most of the last year, and I think we got our disproportionate share of it.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is open.","James Kisner - Jefferies & Co.","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I\u2019ll keep it to one. So, we\u2019ve been hearing about some layoffs in VCE post the consolidation of ownership there. I\u2019m just wondering do you guys see any incremental opportunities as a result of that? Thank you.","Tom Georgens","The short answer to that is yes. I think clearly the trajectory of the business and the underlying relationship there has been problematic for some time. And certainly while this is the latest news, we\u2019ve certainly seen deeper and deeper engagement with Cisco with NetApp around more and more strategic matters going forward around products and co-development and co-marketing, including a lot of joint appearances and a lot of joint events with executives.","So, from our perspective, this is just the latest in the news but the trajectory over the last year clearly has been lots more engagement not just on a product side \u2013 I should say not just on a sales side but from a product and strategy side going forward and we\u2019re very, very, very closely aligned with Cisco\u2019s strategic initiatives going forward. So I think the answer to that question is yes, but I\u2019d say that that didn\u2019t just start last month with the announcement. I think the announcement was a culmination of a broader transition and we\u2019ve seen that activity over the last year and the results of which you\u2019ll see in the market next year.","James Kisner - Jefferies & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Just one question from me. Tom, you highlighted a very robust product roadmap that\u2019s coming to market now. Is there any way you can put a little color on how it impacts revenues over time? When you would think we\u2019d see something show up in the financials that maybe is different from the trends you\u2019re talking about and whether there\u2019s any customer application trends that maybe could drive it faster in the near future? Thanks a lot.","Tom Georgens","Well, I think the revenue impact is expected to be up and I think as far as the trend goes, I think they\u2019re on a bunch of different fronts. I think as far as the Clustered ONTAP announcements of 8.3, in a lot of ways that a culmination release of really the last of the major features that have been holding back some of our customers on the transition front, which is particularly Metrocluster. Certain segments of our market have used that to compete and compete effective and have turned it into almost in every unit item and waiting for that has been an important component of that.","So I think there\u2019s some pent-up demand there clearly around people have been waiting for that technology as a precondition to consider transition. Now they will transition as equipment ages and equipment comes to end of its usable life, so won\u2019t happen overnight. But I still see that 8.3 will generate the next and last major tranche of people that will begin the transition process.","As far as StorageGRID, clearly the opportunity to do Webscale storage is a conversation that we have with a lot of customers, a lot of our service providers both in the U.S. and international. And I think that\u2019s a segment of the market where we had not been able to participate in the past, so I think that opens up new segments to us. FlashRay continuing on the evolution of flash adding to the portfolio EF and all-flash FAS and now FlashRay, so I think that lays out our portfolio there which I think is bigger and broader than anybody\u2019s in the industries.","So I think all of that is couched against a challenging economic backdrop. So from our point of view is we\u2019re not going to forecast the macro. Certainly none of the guidance that Nick and I gave you is anticipating any fundamental change in the macro backdrop, but I believe that our competitiveness today in terms of a refresh of our core technology and additions to the portfolio on top of that not to mention the SteelStore acquisition, I think we have a lot more to sell today than we had six months ago even. So I think that bodes well. The rate of the turnaround, clearly there are other factors that we can\u2019t control. All we can control is our pace of innovation, our ability to sell and service customers and I feel really good about that.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Hi. Thanks. Maybe I\u2019ll shift over to cash deployments. So it seems like you pulled in some of the buyback, at least from a linear perspective, and the vast majority is now complete. Nick, I understand you won\u2019t put out any numbers today but can you at least help investors understand whether NetApp, the Board, et cetera, has the appetite to continue cash returns in excess of free cash flow into '15 or is it more likely you revert back to kind of a steady state that is below free cash flow, let\u2019s say?","Nick Noviello","Hi, Joe. So first of all, we have on the original plan for this year we have 400 million in change to go as of the end of the second quarter. So we\u2019ve got a good chunk remaining ahead of us and the plan was that through May of 2015, we will deploy the rest of that. And we talk about the capital allocation at every Board meeting. Our Board is very sensitive to their share repurchase, dividends and the overall philosophy there. And I think in terms of the guidance we gave that guidance is consistent.","So at this point in time, we will look at all of those pieces on a going forward basis both repurchases and dividends. We will finish out this current authorization by May of 2015. The Board is having that kind of a conversation around the next authorization and all of those pieces, and we\u2019ll announce more as it makes sense to announce more on those things. The strategy and the things that I laid out at our financial Analyst Day in May are consistent until we say something else, frankly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Your line is open.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital","Hi. Thanks. Tom, can you discuss Cloud ONTAP a little more? And what percent of your customer base do you think that will appeal to? And do you think it will have a cannibalistic effect on revenues or a more synergistic effect? And then I just want to sneak this in, if you could just clarify whether \u2013 material revenue contribution from SteelStore is in your guidance? Thanks.","Tom Georgens","The latter question is no; no material contribution of SteelStore. We need to get up at that in going and we need to \u2013 obviously we need to scrub the pipeline and we need to get first-hand knowledge there. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to bake that in at this point.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital","Thanks.","Tom Georgens","The broader question on Clustered ONTAP is I think you need to think about Clustered ONTAP in the big picture and not a standalone product. The goal here for NetApp is while lots of people talk about the cloud in the context of it\u2019s a jungle, it\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s risky and those are awfully euphemisms for we hope it doesn\u2019t happen. I also see a lot of the cloud conversations around steering people to proprietary clouds and our view is that Amazon is going to make a big investment, as is Microsoft and SoftLayer. They are going to create a set of capabilities whether it be around flexibility, around certain workloads and cost around certain workloads that are going to be compelling to the enterprise. And our task and our goal and our strategy is to make it possible for them to bring the hyperscale cloud in and make it look like a seamless extension of what they do on-premise.","So there\u2019s no ambiguity about our position on the public cloud. It\u2019s going to make sense for a set of workloads, our job is to operationalize it. So the broader question isn\u2019t so much about Cloud ONTAP as a point product, it\u2019s about Cloud ONTAP as a completion of a strategy. I can run ONTAP on my hardware, I can run ONTAP on other people\u2019s hardware, I can run ONTAP in the virtual machine on-premise, I can do NetApp private storage where you can keep your storage but use the compute form of Amazon and I can run in Amazon. So all those options are now available to the customer with one set of tools, one set of processes, one set of software, and that\u2019s my definition of software-defined stores is basically a set of common functionality across all instantiations at all locations of data. That\u2019s the big picture.","Now as far as Clustered ONTAP, we\u2019re not viewing it as a point product. We\u2019re viewing it as an essential part of a strategy that\u2019s going to enable NetApp to become the enterprise data management standard. So, yes, we\u2019ll cannibalize some business, it will also allow us to monetize data to the cloud. More importantly, as we can become more ubiquitous as the enterprise data management standard, we can bring more of the data management both in the cloud and on-premise over time and that\u2019s the real push on this technology. So Cloud ONTAP is not a point product. Certainly it can be bought and procured that way, but it\u2019s part of a much broader strategy to ultimately create seamless data management across the entire enterprise, across all media. That\u2019s what we want to do.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Maynard Um - Wells Fargo","Hi. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about your channel? And if with the new opportunities, you think there have to be shifts, because I think one thing that came out of Insight was that NetApp\u2019s professional services team is now available to channel partners and I\u2019m wondering if that suggest greater complexity in the sales process or suggest the potential for higher costs. I was just hoping if you could just share a little bit of color around your thoughts on channel in general in context of the changes in the industry. Thanks.","Tom Georgens","Well, I think we want to get crisper about our channel positioning over time that professional \u2013 to separate these two points. Professional services is an essential part of customer success with our technology. And there\u2019s a need for that in our enterprise accounts and there\u2019s a need for that with our channel partners. We want to focus our professional services around accounts that either expect or demand that that service comes directly from us around very, very complex services or around things only NetApp can do, which would mean things that usually have an engineering modification component.","The rest of the business for the purpose of velocity, we want to have our channel partners do. It\u2019s a big business opportunity for them. We don\u2019t want to be competing with them for it. So in general, not just around professional services but even around go-to-market, we\u2019re looking for our channel partners to become more self-sufficient, more capable both on the pre-sell side and the post-sell side. So they can basically drive more of our business in the midsized business and NetApp can focus its dedicated resources in the enterprise.","So over time, I think we want to be much, much clearer about our delineation of our staff between our support of the midsized business, which is mostly through channel partners, which means a significant investment on our part to get them up to speed and capable and competent. It also means that we\u2019re not competing with them for business. So they are at a position to make a much bigger commitment to NetApp because our objectives are quite clear. And likewise, as we see a rebound and strength in growth of large deals, those are things that we want to capture and we want to cultivate and we want to have more of our NetApp direct resources working in our largest enterprise accounts driving big opportunities and big business for us.","So over time, we want to be very clear about our delineation of our skills and where we\u2019re going to deploy our resources. We want our best channel partners to be more capable and more competent and we will steer more business their way and we will give them the support that they need and we want to focus our direct resources on the big accounts and the big opportunities. And we talked about that at financial Analyst Day in terms of the segments that matter to us and I think we\u2019re six months into transition now and so far so good.","Operator","Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Thanks. The midpoint of January guidance assumes the same 4% sequential growth as you reported a year ago even though you have a tougher U.S. public comp from the October quarter this time around, you have the FX headwind and you\u2019ve talked about some mixed macro. So is there something that\u2019s driving more confidence around the January quarter versus the last few and especially relative to the year ago?","Nick Noviello","I think all those data points are true. I think we have more things to sell and I think that our story in terms of the cloud and Insight and hopefully the catalyst that that will provide. We did our Las Vegas event last week. We\u2019re doing our European event next week. So if I look going forward, I certainly wouldn\u2019t consider the forecast euphoric. As you point out we certainly have FX headwinds and other things. On the other hand, I think our competitive position only gets better.","We really don\u2019t have any aging products. Just about everything of substance is either brand new or it has just been updated and I just feel that our competitive position is stronger than it\u2019s been in some time. And at the end of the day, 4% isn\u2019t 15% either. So I want to be pushing hard, I want to set high goals, I want to be cognizant of the world around us. But the simple fact of the matter is I think our competitive position today is better than it was six months or a year ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray","Thank you. Maybe just from a geographic perspective, I know you said that the regions came in largely as expected, but the 2.9% decline in Europe looks like it\u2019s the worst it\u2019s been since Q1 of 2012. So do you think you could see any sort of market share loss in that region or was it more related to disruption in Ukraine and the overall macro? Thanks.","Tom Georgens","On those numbers, there\u2019s also the OEM business that\u2019s wrapped into that. If I think about bookings, which is probably a more indicative of the current state of the business, they continue to be quite strong and they were definitely in positive territory. There is no doubt that the Russian sanctions had some complexity in terms of who we can sell to and the velocity of fulfillment and that certainly had some impact on the business but not enough to talk about. So we certainly see the Russian and Ukraine influence and I think that that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not zero but not material. It\u2019s a few million dollars.","But at the end of the day, I think in light of all of these headlines around Europe in general and Germany in particular, those teams continue to execute well. So when I look from a booking perspective, I would say that looking at bookings I don\u2019t see our performance commensurate with the headlines and we certainly hope that that continues. But right now FX is a bigger concern than the overall economic condition in terms of impacting our Germany business in particular.","Nick Noviello","Yes, I would also add to that that our European business in the second quarter at 28% or 29% of overall revenue is right in line with what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years.","Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Alexander with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Brian Alexander - Raymond James","All right. Thank you. Nick, if I look at the deferred revenue, long-term deferred hasn\u2019t really grown year-over-year in the last four quarter but your short-term deferred is up about 6% to 8% over that same timeframe. So I realize product revenue growth has been a bit lackluster and that\u2019s a major factor here, and maybe customers are renewing maintenance on a shorter term basis as they prolong their product refresh activity. Is there anything else driving the wedge between short-term and long-term deferred and is there anything we should take away from either maintenance attach rates or maintenance pricing that\u2019s driving that gap? Thanks.","Nick Noviello","I think your point around what customers do on the renewal side, what they do as they understand more and more about what Clustered ONTAP can do to them but they want to make those transitions when it makes sense from an operational perspective, when it makes sense from a financial perspective and all those pieces, I think that\u2019s really the key here. There\u2019s nothing outside of the renewal cycle and what\u2019s going on with that that would really be driving this.","Remember, every one of those contracts with customers have their own term to them, their own value in the overall contract to them. Sometimes those are standalone type of transactions, sometimes they are tied up with other product sales, but there is nothing overall or an umbrella concept that I would say would be changing things here. But this point about renewing for shorter periods of time while customers are getting ready for a Clustered ONTAP transition, that absolutely makes sense.","Brian Alexander - Raymond James","I was just going to follow up and say, you would still say the change in deferred going forward should be a positive contributor to cash flow.","Nick Noviello","Deferred revenue is absolutely a positive contributor.","Brian Alexander - Raymond James","Okay.","Tom Georgens","And I will echo Nick\u2019s comments. I think one of them clearly a short-term renewals on equipment, whether it\u2019s because budgets can\u2019t support a tech refresh at this time whether it\u2019s because they\u2019re waiting to do a Clustered ONTAP transition, whether they\u2019re waiting for 8.3, I think all of those are factors that would be indicative of a lot of equipment that is getting closer and closer to its need for tech refresh. When that actual transition occurs, obviously it\u2019s going to be a function to budget.","But I think the general case of as we go through and we talked about revenue growth, we should not also lose sight of the fact that we had over $100 million of year-over-year growth in the deferred revenue balance. So once again, indicative of the growth of the business, a fair amount of our transactions have a current revenue component and a deferred component and that\u2019s an important indicator of our overall business levels as well just as important as the revenue.","Brian Alexander - Raymond James","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. This is Mitch Steves filling in for Amit. One quick question on FlashRay. Do you guys expect that to be a material driver for branded growth? And how should we think about that product relative to the EF540 array?","Tom Georgens","It is going to be a branded product, so all the FlashRay product will be in the branded category. In terms of the overall portfolio, I think that there\u2019s several points. The EF product is optimized for just raw performance and the classic workload that we see there is database acceleration, the data migration and the data placement is managed by the application itself typically Oracle and ASM. And the key differentiator there is high availability, because a lot of those environments have very, very high availability requirements, they tend to be very, very mission-critical, high-performance applications.","So the maturity of the EF family which has been doing high availability longer than NetApp in fact allows us to compete for that very, very high performance with high availability. And the high availability requirement disqualifies a lot of the start-ups. As far as FlashRay, it\u2019s less around raw brute performance although obviously it\u2019s a flash array and performance is an important characteristic, but it\u2019s really that married with data management and married with storage efficiency. So the ability to deliver performance and with compelling always on storage efficiency and very, very compelling ease of use is really the positioning for FlashRay.","All-flash FAS is also a critical part of this story, but I think you should think about that as we certainly sell it certainly today as a point all-flash product competing against some of the other products and particularly with 8.3, the performance characteristics were remarkable; in fact clearly outperforming the biggest competitors in that space including the newly architected designs.","But the way to think about all-flash FAS beyond just a point product is imagine all-flash FAS not as a standalone all-flash array but as a node in the cluster. And you can have an all-flash FAS and a cluster as a high performance device and then next to it you can have a machine that\u2019s got 2,000 disc drives that\u2019s optimized for capacity and you can use all of our transparent volume migration that\u2019s already part of Clustered ONTAP to do the data migrations, the data ages so you\u2019ll always have fresh space for your high-performance data in the flash. Or you could basically distribute the flash to the entire cluster and use all of our scale-out capabilities to do that.","So from our point of view whether it\u2019s the raw performance used case, whether it\u2019s the general purpose efficient used case like a FlashRay or whether it\u2019s the business critical and traditional business app worst case as part of a clustered solution with all-flash FAS, that\u2019s a pretty broad landscape and nobody else can match that. So from our perspective, I think we feel great about the portfolio. I think we see FlashRay in customers\u2019 hands getting great feedback on the performance and the ease of use and the efficiency, getting a bigger and bigger role. So simply put, EF all about performance; FlashRay around performance with efficiency and all-flash FAS around network stores for business applications using all of the premium features that\u2019s available in ONTAP but with the speed of flash.","Operator","Our last question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup","Thanks very much. Just kind of looking at the big picture and strategy, you guys have also gone through some restructuring recently. If I remember correctly, a lot of indications show that you\u2019re redeploying some of those restructurings into reinvesting into the business. Can you confirm kind of if that\u2019s true and are we seeing the fruit of that reinvestment happening now or when should we see it? Because you got to kind of scratch your head a little bit when you see that year-over-year it looks like net income is not growing and maybe it simply just takes some time to harvest some of the reinvestments and when should we see it happen? Thank you.","Nick Noviello","Jim, let me start with this but yes, when we talked about the work we did last year, this is really about repositioning. This is really about setting our portfolio for the go forward, right, and a point that we were going to reinvest in the business in those areas where we were going to see or we believe we were going to get the biggest return in the future. That ramps up. So the investment comes in over a period of time and I think largely the investment is in now. And then that investment gets on to those productive activities to yield returns. So those are all part of the plan, those are all things we are doing, we\u2019ve invested in and we\u2019re doing going forward.","Tom Georgens","Yes. One thing I\u2019d point out is that there\u2019s actually been two restructurings. One last year and the year before and a key component of those restructurings was to reposition resources against high priority activities for us. And if you look at what we\u2019ve just announced since we last met on this call, we\u2019ve announced FlashRay, we\u2019ve announced StorageGRID Webscale, Cloud ONTAP, ONTAP 8.3. Resources redeployed against those activities is why those activities exist and why they exist now.","So the things that we did just this past year, some of them are reflected in those activities and some of those are reflected in future innovation and future investments not only on the product side but also on the go-to-market side and services side. So I think no doubt I believe our headcount today is higher than it was before we did the restructuring. We are doing the restructuring because we were out of ideas and we didn\u2019t know what to spend money on. We did those restructuring because we had a lot of ideas that we wanted to get on and get our resources aligned to it, and I think we did that.","So I guess just to wrap up, I guess just kind of the summary. Where we are, I think it\u2019s a challenging environment but the business performed as we expected. If we look about the rest of the year, I think absent the dilution of the SteelStore and the FX, I think the EPS and the revenue for the year are more or less what we said they were going to be when we last talked to you. So I think we see consistently in the rest of the year, despite a fair number of moving parts.","Probably for us, I\u2019d say probably the two big headline things for us since we last met; big portfolio build out and the products that I just mentioned. Obviously, the acquisition of SteelStore on top of that and I also think that we\u2019ve become a lot crisper in our messaging and communication with not only our internal audiences but now with customers and analysts and the community around our hybrid cloud strategy.","And key elements of that whether it\u2019d be NetApp private storage or Cloud ONTAP are now reeling in the market. So when I think about just the raw technology and where we are today, our go-forward story about the hybrid cloud and the prove points against it, I feel really good about what we\u2019ve accomplished certainly over the last 90 days and the last year.","So thanks for your time. Hopefully, see you all again next quarter. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s program. This concludes the program.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, please begin.","Kris Newton","Hello and thank you for joining us on our Q2 fiscal year 2016 earnings call. With me today are CEO, George Kurian and CFO, Nick Noviello.","This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our Web site at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and a non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2016, our expectations regarding our ability to respond to changing demands of our customers in an increasing uncertain macroeconomic environment, our ability to manage our cost structure portfolio and processes to drive efficiency, profitability and growth, our expectations regarding market acceptance of Clustered ONTAP, our ability to drive operational and financial performance, and our expectations regarding our business model in FY16 all of which involve risk and uncertainty.","Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today.

Thanks for joining us today. Our Q2 fiscal year \u201916 financial results were generally as expected. We\u2019ve continued to make progress as we pivot towards growing parts of the market, scale out software-defined flash, converged and hybrid cloud. Our key investment areas of sales capacity, channel traction and acceleration of the transition of our install base to Clustered Data ONTAP continue to show early results. Our focus remained on enabling our customer success as they navigate their IT transformations to leverage modern architectures and deploy hybrid cloud solutions.","Over the course of our second quarter, I\u2019ve continued to rigorously analyze our business, I traveled around the world and participated in our Insight user conference, meeting with thousands of customers and partners. The feedback I heard was overwhelmingly positive and reaffirmed my conviction that our Data Fabric strategy resonates with and is aligned to our customer\u2019s strategic technical direction, underpinning our confidence and the opportunity ahead. We\u2019ve made progress but we still have more work to do to become more efficient and agile, so that we can best take advantage of our long term growth opportunity. An increasing uncertain macroeconomic environment, continued shifts in the market and an aggressive pricing environment, have slightly tempered our fiscal year 2016 outlook. By coupling the strength of our Data Fabric strategy and the benefits we deliver to customers, with a more efficient and agile business, we can generate value for customers, partners, employees, and shareholders over time. I have tremendous confidence in our opportunity for success.","That said, parts of our business are working well, some parts need improvement and other parts we must manage through declines. The IT spending environment continues to be constrained and the expectation for growth for the overall storage market has decreased to low single-digits. At the same time, customers are seeking to take advantage of new applications and modern data center storage and data management architectures. Based on our analysis, this has resulted in the traditional standalone hybrid storage market declining at approximately 9%, while at the same time, the parts of the market addressed by our scale out, software-defined, flash converged and hybrid cloud solutions are growing at a rate of roughly 20%.","Highly disciplined portfolio management is required to address the different growth rates of our markets. We must be more efficient in the parts of our business that aren\u2019t growing in order to generate sufficient profits that can be returned to shareholders and leveraged for investment in areas of growth to deliver innovation ahead of the market. We have already sized our investments in OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode commensurate with the opportunity and I have recently consolidated all of our hardware platform engineering teams into a single group for further efficiency.","IT spending will remain under pressure as customers evaluate cloud and modern architectures. We are growing our install base and have made investments in growth areas that are showing results, although they are not yet enough to offset the decline in our traditional business. The decline in standalone hybrid storage most notably impacts our traditional ONTAP 7-Mode business. The 7-Mode storage operating system was shipped on about 30% of FAS units in the quarter, down from roughly 65% a year ago. ONTAP 7-Mode unit shipments were down almost 60% year-over-year and Q2 marked the first time that we did not experience growth in the 7-Mode install base.","At a subset of our customers, the normal hardware refresh cycle has been slowed as they plan for the move to clustered ONTAP. We continue to work to smooth this transition for our customers and in our insight user conference last month, we announced the port for ONTAP 7-Mode through 2020. Customers are also slowing investment in the capacity expansion of their traditional 7-Mode storage environment. The dynamics of our 7-Mode and OEM businesses continue to put downward pressure on product revenue, despite strong growth in other parts of our business.","As a part of their IT modernization efforts, customers want scale out and software define storage functionality for efficient management of data growth and cloud service provider like flexibility, Clustered ONTAP enabled seamless data management across flash, disc and cloud footprint for enterprise applications like databases, virtualization and ecommerce. The software-defined architecture of Clustered ONTAP provides a consistent way to manage data across public and private cloud regardless of underlying hardware.","Clustered ONTAP was deployed on approximately 70% of FAS systems shipped in Q2, up from 35% a year ago and unit shipments of Clustered ONTAP systems grew over 95% year-over-year demonstrating continued strong customer demand. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we created a set of Clustered ONTAP transition program to accelerate the migration of install base customers who are ready to upgrade both their systems and their software from ONTAP 7-Mode to Clustered ONTAP. These programs of customers and certified partners transition support, temporary gear and financial incentives.","We saw strong uptake in Q2, almost all of which was done with the tremendous support of our channel partners, while these programs helped migration ready customers move, migrations themselves are projects that must fit within the overall IT priorities and budgets of our customers. The low growth of overall IT spending has an impact on the pace of migration. As we have stated before, we anticipate that the transition of the install base will happen over the course of year. The Clustered ONTAP install base continues to grow and now represents 17% of total install FAS system and almost 30% of installed FAS capacity. The number of customers who purchase Clustered ONTAP systems in Q2 grew by 85% from Q2 last year.","And in that same period, the number of new to NetApp customers who purchased Clustered ONTAP in Q2 grew by 95%. Customers are deploying high performance flash technology to gain advantages from accelerating business transactions, processes and their supporting enterprise applications. Our all flash FAS products offer enterprise grade flash technology combining built-in data protection, multi-protocol support, scale out performance and seamless data movement from flash to disk to cloud. After introducing flash essentials, with optimized read performance, in line compression and in line zero based deduplication in Q1. We improved both the list price and form factor for our All Flash FAS by 40% as well as announced a controller upgrade program, a seven year extended warranty and a 3x performance guarantee. These enhancements garnered positive feedback in the channel and drove rapid adoption of our All Flash FAS products with unit shipments accelerating 445% year-over-year, the sixth consecutive quarter of triple digit growth. ","To meet the requirements of ultra high performance, low latency application, customers opt for our ES product. Units of the ES series grew 65% from Q2 a year ago. In order to achieve the performance, availability and cost requirements of new web scale and analytic applications like Hadoop and Splunk, and the increase in the amount of data retained on line for business insight and cyber security, customers are deploying our E Series platform. For customers who are increasing their cyber security defenses with real time analysis the E Series capability to store hot and cold data under the same data management architecture substantially improved the efficiency and flexibility of their environment. We are aggressively targeting this part of the market and continue to see growth of the E Series with unit shipments up over 20% from Q2 last year.","Our hybrid cloud solution comprised NetApp private storage for clouds, cloud ONTAP, StorageGRID Webscale and AltaVault. While these solutions do not contribute materially to revenue today, they are important in positioning us for leading edge hybrid cloud deployment. A large European manufacturing company chose NetApp for our cloud integration, coupled with converged and All Flash solutions and the ability to manage it all under a single framework in Clustered ONTAP.","Similarly we had wins at a global law firm. A large global security vendor, a US based software management company and many others because of our ability to deliver highly competitive storage solutions and have a broader strategic discussion encompassing cloud ready integration and enablement with the world's leading cloud service providers. This is the power of the data fabric at work. For customers looking for preintegrated converged solutions NetApp offers FlexPod in conjunction with Cisco. NetApp and Cisco introduced FlexPod five years ago and have generated 5.6 billion in shared revenue delivered by more than 1,100 partners to more than 6,300 customers worldwide.","In Q2 we announced a Cisco validated design for All Flash FAS FlexPod with Cisco's application centric infrastructure ACI. You will continue to see exciting innovations from our strong partnership with Cisco. Our customers are transforming themselves using digital technology, connected with pervasive broadband network and cloud computing to improve the efficiency of their businesses, build global business systems and better serve their customers. Data is at the heart of that transformation. At the same time they are scrutinizing the value that they have gained from past investments in IT, reducing IT budgets and rethinking how they consume IT. This evaluation is creating caution on traditional storage system transactional spending and is diverting spending towards transformational projects and modern architectures like scale out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud, where our data fabric strategy gives us an advantage over the competition. ","NetApp is the only company that can help customers manage their data seamlessly across multiple cloud architectures, and provide the scale and modern architectures needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital era.","NetApp is changing to position the company for long term growth. We expect to gain share in the traditional part of the market but that alone won't be sufficient to overcome the decline of that market and drive overall growth for NetApp. We will continue our pivot towards modern architectures such as scale out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud. The growth in this part of our business is strong and encouraging. Customer and partner feedback drives strong conviction that our industry leading portfolio and differentiated data fabric strategy will expand our opportunity and drive long term growth. However this transition will take time as the growth is coming off a smaller base than our traditional ONTAP 7-Mode footprint.","We are investing to accelerate growth and are taking action on the cost structure of the business to ensure value creation for customers and shareholders through the duration of this transition. In fact we're conducting a fundamental assessment of every aspect of our business structure, portfolio and process to reduce complexity and drive the efficiency while improving our velocity and investing for long-term growth. This will require making some important decisions about topics crucial to our business from our product portfolio to our go-to-market approach and our supporting functions.","We must both invest for the long-term growth of our business and preserve our current growth initiatives that are showing early results while streamlining and improving the efficiency of our business. We will lower the cost structure of the Company but will not take actions that improve our short-term results at the expense of our long-term strength. There is growth to be had in this industry and we believe we have the right strategy and technology to capture that growth in the long-term and deliver increased shareholder value overtime.","NetApp has the innovation, scale, and open ecosystem needed to solve the data management challenges for the enterprise. The changes to larger players in the market create opportunity for us. NetApp is the only company able to span flash to disk to cloud and the only company delivering the ability to manage data across multiple clouds and on premises today. Many elements of our portfolio are growing strongly and we need to capitalize on them by maintaining our sales capacity, continuing our channel efforts and making it easier for our installed based to migrated Clustered ONTAP.","Customer wins and partner feedback indicate that we\u2019re on the right path. We have a portfolio of differentiated IT and a growing install base, we are delivering tremendous value to customers in their strategic IT transformation, it is critical that we build a stronger more efficient company that solves customer challenges while delivering profitability and earnings growth in a moderated IT spending and storage market. You can expect tangible results from this process over the remainder of this fiscal year and beyond.","Before turning the call over to Nick, I would like to thank the entire NetApp team for their hard work and dedication as we evolve our great company for future growth and sustained success. And I would like to extend a special thank you to Rob Salmon, President, who after 22 years announced his intent to retire from NetApp at the end of the fiscal year. We appreciate all he has done for the Company and his work to ensure a smooth transition.","I'll now turn it over to Nick.","Nick Noviello","Thank you, George, good afternoon everyone. Before we get started as a reminder I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's discussion unless otherwise indicated. Overall, we are pleased with our Q2 financial results and the progress we're making related to our key investments, in sales capacity, in the channel and in accelerating the migration to Clustered ONTAP.","Starting with revenues, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.45 billion, up about 8% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact on the year-over-year comparison by about 4 point. As George indicated, the overall IT spending environment is pressured, this coupled with the uncertain macroeconomic environment has affected us in different ways across our geographies.","For example our U.S. public sector business declined 22% year-over-year in Q2 while at the same time excluding impacts from foreign exchange, EMEA and Asia-Pacific were up 8% and 3% year-over-year respectively. Product revenue of $815 million was up 23% sequentially in line with expectations but was down 12% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline reflects favorable Clustered ONTAP momentum which was more than offset by about 5 points of FX headwinds and declines in ONTAP 7-Mode revenue which we expected as well as OEM revenue due to the changing business dynamics of our OEM customers.","The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues primarily derived from existing new and renewed service contracts was up 3% year-over-year but down 6% sequentially, reflecting the return to a 13 week quarter. As a reminder, we had an extra week in Q1 which resulted in about a $40 million increase to Q1 maintenance revenue. Indirect revenue accounted for 77% of net revenues similar to Q1. Gross margin of 62.5% was down about 2.5 point year-over-year and about a half a point below our prior guidance range.","FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact of about 1 point year-over-year. Product gross margin of 51.8% was up about 0.5 of a point sequentially and was down about 6.5 points year-over-year, driven by about 2.5 points of FX and roughly equal impacts from higher discounting and unfavorable product mix. On the year-over-year basis, software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up 2 points reflecting a favorable mix shift towards hardware maintenance as well as infrastructure cost efficiencies.","Q2 operating expenses totaled $684 million and were down 8% quarter-over-quarter and 6% year-over-year. This sequential decline reflects a combination of a return to a 13 week quarter and prudent expense management. Operating margin for the second quarter of 15.2% was 7.5 points higher than last quarter and was just above our previous guidance range. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17% as expected. Weighted average diluted share count of 296 million shares decreased by approximately 12 million shares sequentially and 8% year-over-year due to share repurchase activity. Q2 EPS $0.61 was a penny above the high end of our prior guidance range.","Now turning to cash and balance sheet metrics, we closed Q2 with $4.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, 14% of which was held by our domestic entities. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue decreased by $20 million in Q2 versus Q1 and was flat year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 17 in line with our expectations and days sales outstanding normalized to 37 days from 30 days in Q1 reflecting the return to a 13 week quarter.","Q2 cash flow from operations was approximately $145 million versus $381 million in Q2 a year ago. Free cash flow of $99 million was about 7% of net revenues, down substantially from Q2 a year ago due to lower net income and the return to normal levels of DSO and accrued compensation, net of improved inventory turns related to the 14th week in Q1.","Finally, we repurchased approximately $183 million of stock and paid $53 million in cash dividends during the quarter. Consistent with our previous guidance we remain on track to complete our share repurchase program by the end of May 2018 with the first $1 billion [ph] of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016. Today we also announced our next cash dividends of $0.18 per share of the company\u2019s stock that will be paid on January 20, 2016.","Now turning to our business outlook, we remain confident in our strategy and long-term growth potential. As I discussed last quarter fiscal year 2016 is one of transition. We are realizing results from our investments in sales capacity, actions to regain traction in the channel and programs to accelerate the migration to Clustered ONTAP. Coming into the year we anticipated that top-line predictability would improve in the back half but the uncertain macroeconomic environment continued shifts in our market, and an aggressive pricing environment have resulted in continued limited visibility.","While we have made progress in rebuilding our pipeline, these factors have slightly tempered our outlook. As a result, we expect revenue for fiscal 2016 to be down just over 5%. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth and our continued actions to drive down costs, given the environment we now estimate fiscal 2016 gross margin to be down 1 to 2 points from fiscal 2015 and operating margin to be down about 2 points for the year. We expect second half operating margin of approximately 18% the low end of our target operating margin range. Although off to a slow start in the first half we expect free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for the second half of the year to be in the mid-teens.","Finally we expect to reduce share count in fiscal 2016 by approximately 6% and between dividends and share repurchases we will again return over 100% of free cash flow generated in the fiscal year to shareholders.","As George discussed we are assessing every aspect of our business to drive efficiency and velocity. We will lower our cost structure including cost reduction actions in the second half of fiscal 2016 we will drive greater efficiency across the business and at the same time make investments in growth areas leading to increased profitability longer term growth and increased shareholder value.","For Q3 we expect net revenues to range between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion which at the midpoint implies flat revenues versus Q2 and a 7% decrease year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margin of approximately 61.5% and operating margin of approximately 17%. Based on our share repurchases in Q2 and in the first 10 days of Q3 we expect our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 297 million shares and earnings per share for Q2 to range from approximately $0.66 to $0.71 per share.","In summary we are confident in the opportunity ahead of us. Customer wins and feedback from partners indicate that our data fabric strategy is differentiated and well aligned with their most critical IT imperatives. We must improve our efficiency and agility to take full advantage of those opportunities and to set NetApp on a path for increased profitability, long-term growth and increased shareholder value.","I will now turn the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?","Kris Newton","Thanks Nick. We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers, and limit yourself to one question, so that we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jayson Noland of Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Jayson Noland","I wanted to ask George on the transition program. Could you provide some more detail on the economic incentives that are behind cTAP and then how are the credits accounts for on the P&L?","George Kurian","The credits are essentially discounts related to the product bookings that were registered as part of that program. So every transaction that is qualified for the cTAP incentives goes through a deal registration process that we administer. In terms of the program itself, the incentives and enablement that we have conducted include the availability of temporary swing gear on a loan basis to customers that need temporary capacity, some set of incentives around professional services to help them enumerate the cost of the overall migration effort. A majority of the transitions have being done through the partners and there have been strong update and good feedback from the partners in the second quarter of this year, the number of partners that participated in the Clustered ONTAP acceleration program expanded substantially from Q1 across all of the geographies in the world, as well as the number of customer transactions also expanded substantially from Q1. So we\u2019re pleased with progress. We thank our partners for leading in with us on this important effort.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","George can you give us a little bit more color on -- you had mentioned that you\u2019re doing the strategic reviews and a lot of the efficiencies and stuff like that. Is there anything we can judge or put as milestones or look ahead and see how quickly you\u2019re assessing these items? And then for Nick, can you talk a little bit about cash flow, whether it\u2019d be an extra week last quarter, and not the extra week this quarter. If you sum up the two quarters in total, you kind of in my view washes out the extra week factor. And when you look at the two quarters together, the cash flow looks down significantly year-over-year. Is that kind of the new run rate we\u2019re looking at for cash flows as a percent of revenues? Or how should we think about cash flows, because it seems like it\u2019s directionally stepped back a little bit? Thank you.","George Kurian","I\u2019ll take the first question and then hand over to Nick. I\u2019d appreciate the next few callers to just stick with your question. In terms of the overall assessments that we have conducted, it\u2019s really focused on both efficiency as well as velocity. And what I mean by that is efficiency around all aspects of our business, structure, portfolio, business process, so that customers find it easier to do business with us as well as partners. In terms of velocity, we feel that having accomplished the efficiency aspects of the program, we will be able to transition our business more quickly in response to changing market landscapes. We\u2019ll just be a leaner, more efficient Company that can be more agile in response to the changing market environment. You will hear more from me over the second half of this fiscal year and over the next few quarters beyond that as we go through the program. Stay tuned it is a fundamental reassessment of all aspects of our Company.","Nick Noviello","And Jim just quickly, with respect to the cash flow, I think this is consistent with the slow start up of the year right. The first half was intended to be a rebuild, both of the pipeline and a rebuild of the business condition. You saw that in terms of even the operating margins as we grew up in the first half year. You can see it in net income. Second point would be that as we look at the second half, our view is that we\u2019re going to be in the mid-teens in terms of cash flow as a percentage of revenue in the second half. So, that clearly washes out all of the implications of timing, 13-week versus the 14-week quarter and all of those pieces.","Operator","Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia of CLSA. Your line is open.","Lou Miscioscia","When you look at your operating franchise, sales, marketing, R&D, G&A, you did a good job year-over-year, and obviously quarter-over-quarter taking out the prior week. Should we expect it to more or less stay flat absolute at this level going forward? And then if you could comment where do you think it could go even more into the future into \u201917 and beyond? Because it sounds like you want to continue to take a good cost out, or take cost out?","Nick Noviello","Hi Lou this is Nick, so a couple of things. I think if you back through the guidance, you will see an implied reduction quarter-over-quarter, so a sequential between Q2 and Q3 reduction in operating expenses overall. Also it\u2019d say that 47% of revenue in Q2 is not the type of level we expect for the business, in the long-term, or in the long-term models. So, more to come, and we\u2019ll talk more about that, George indicated that he\u2019d spend more time talking about the portfolio and all of the things we\u2019re looking at, but suffice it to say for purposes of the Q3 guide you can back through that and see that we expect operating expense to be down sequentially and down even as a percentage of revenue versus Q2.","Operator","Our next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Kulbinder Garcha","And a question for both of you I guess on gross margins on the product side, and it\u2019s under pressure this year we are seeing currently but they kind of feel almost permanent and the currencies are where they are and then on top of that pricing seems intense. There is always kind of intense in this industry and you're going through a prolonged transition which I assume opens you to more competitive attack. So would I be wise in concluding that this level of gross margin is probably all we\u2019re going to see for some time or are there some of the drivers or initiatives that work to bring them back to historic level? Thanks.","Nick Noviello","Sure, Kulbinder let me start with that, so certainly if you look at the gross margins and specifically the product gross margins for the quarter on a year-over-year basis we have a 2.5 point impact alone from foreign exchange, we don\u2019t expect that type of thing and in fact that will start to mitigate as we get certainly to Q4. We do have higher discounting, I made that clear. Last quarter and actually in Q4 I talked about higher discounting, it's about two points impact on a year-over-year basis to product gross margin this quarter that we have to work through, that is the aggressive pricing actions going on in the industry right now, we have to look it.","That said, overtime we\u2019ve shown that we can move margins here and in fact over a several years we did exactly that. Finally, I would say that on the services side of our business the team has done a really good job in terms of leveraging the cost base and servicing the enormous install base of customers that we have. So I think it's a combination of items certainly the aggressive pricing environment it is something that we have to be reflective of, the portfolio is something we spend a lot of time working on and thinking about and the uptake of Clustered ONTAP with customers and those actions on the hybrid cloud portfolio overtime we expect to see benefits to margins of the Company.","Operator","Our next question is from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner","I was hoping if you can give us a little bit of geographic detail in terms of what you saw across the world, it looks like the Asia business saw some nice uptick in the quarter just curious what that\u2019s about? And looks like maybe the public business was maybe a bit softer, so hoping to get some more detail? Thanks.","Nick Noviello","Okay Sherri, let me just start on that for a second, so if I take the impact of currency out our EMEA business actually did really well in the quarter and that EMEA business year-over-year without currency was up 8%, Asia was up 3. The challenge obviously was in the U.S. public sector down 22, no foreign currency impact there. I think that to start and I am sure George may have a comment or two as well, I think the EMEA team has done an incredible job really over the course I am going to say no of this last year plus of taking Clustered Data ONTAP and the promise of the portfolio and the data fabric and bringing that to customers, I think it started there.","And Asia, we obviously had some very strong areas, we have some that are more challenged and we have some macroeconomic implications in Asia that we\u2019re just going to have to work through and the team there is working through it. In the U.S. public sector, there is a variety of things going on that we just have to be aware of. I would say that we are not anticipating a recovery in the U.S. public sector as we move into Q3.","George Kurian","Just to add some color to that, I think when I look across the geographies our large enterprise customers continue to do good business with us across all the geographies. To add some color to the Asia-Pac and public sector comments, in Asia Pac you certainly saw the impact of the slowdown of China, in the countries that were dependent on China either for investment or as suppliers to the Chinese economy. So it was while the overall business met expectations there was a wide range of different countries. I think in terms of the public sector itself. We do large amount of business through the global system integrators and their business was challenged within the public sector model. We also saw in some cases program delays or prioritization of spend towards priority such as cyber security. We feel confident of our position in the public sector business, we are the number one provider of storage and data management and we continue to win our preponderant majority of new opportunities within the public sector.","Operator","Our next question is from Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah","This could be for either, George or for Nick just what I guess anecdotally is the right way to think about the levers around the R&D it certainly seemed to be just if you take a look at this quarter one of the contributors to the OpEx, the OpEx I would say kind of catalytic performance. But it just seems like this year is going to be a little bit softer than last year and in the context of I may have to give specifics now, but like looking at the overall portfolio is there anything that you can tell us now philosophically how you're looking about the -- looking at the R&D going forward given that we've already seen it come off a little bit? Thanks.","George Kurian","When we look at portfolio management we look at it on both products and product market as well as customer segments, geographies and all aspects of the business. As I said in my prepared remarks we run a very disciplined portfolio management process which means that for capabilities that are mature in the market we continue to reduce our investments in those parts of the business whether they are pathways, whether they are customer segments or on the product portfolio side and reinvest some of that into the faster growing emerging parts of the market. We returned some of that certainly to shareholders and some of that we reinvest to the faster growing parts of the market, so that's our portfolio management approach and we've implemented it, it's certainly part of the model that you're seeing being implemented in the Company going forward and that's what's driving discipline in the operating expense stack.","Operator","Our next question is from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Market, your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","I guess George I just want to understand this cost containment side you talked expectation last earnings call that we would have more update this time around. So I'm curious what are you seeing and what's driving this announcement of cost optimization to be more further pushed out and then broadly as you think of your business if you have a zero to down 5% revenue trajectory what do you think the right OpEx number is, is it sort of 20% or 40% for you guys? Thank you.","George Kurian","We have done a thorough analysis of the business and identified a number of areas to drive fundamental transformation that fundamental transformation is both to improve the efficiency of the business and also make it easier to do business with NetApp. To do those actions will take time to achieve the full desired outcome, but it is what will help the Company both transform our operating expense stack, as well as make it easier to do business with us so that we can drive top-line velocity. The things that we have done are already showing results in the quarter so we have taken some action in the quarter and we said we will take further actions through the second half of the year and you will see more progress updates as we take those actions on. So we are not saying that we're pushing out any action to next fiscal year. We're going to start and we're going to continue to do it over multiple quarters.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian White of Drexel. Your line is open.","Brian White","I'm wondering if you could give us a little color on how you're thinking about the Dell EMC deal and the opportunities that they open up or the threats that you see from this transaction. Thank you.","George Kurian","First of all I would say that my opening comment is that the Dell EMC transaction is yesterday's solution to tomorrow's customers' problems. It does not fundamentally address the hybrid cloud, it does not fundamentally address the data management opportunity that customers are forced to deal with. It is really about trying to build efficiency in an integrated hardware business rather than the software-defined data center of the future. I think in the near-term based on discussions with multiple customers and partners it is generating a lot of uncertainties for customers and resellers and that is clearly an opportunity for NetApp, which we intend to take advantage of. In the long-term the absence of a compelling story around the ITR section of the future will make their customer value propositions something that we can debate and capitalize on. We are taking action to improve the efficiency of our business to be able to deal with larger scale competitors and be more agile than they are. And I'll summarize at that.","Operator","Our next question is from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Maynard Um","George you talk about portfolio management but it sounds more like you're looking for areas that de-emphasis in declining products. You obviously have a pretty strong customer install base even in large enterprises, so I'm curious why you wouldn't look to more aggressively broaden out your portfolio to cross sell more products into your existing install base and then across your broad channel. And I know you've done acquisitions like buying Riverbed's SteelStore product but why not have a more aggressive product acquisition strategy maybe even larger to increase your revenue per customer rather than returning the cash to shareholders and I guess the question really boils down to NetApp being either a growth versus value company and which one you think is right for the Company long-term? Thanks.","George Kurian","I would tell you that we are in a changing market landscape where some parts of the market are declining and some parts of the market are growing quickly. I would say that it is important for us from a management perspective to apply discipline and maturely harvest the categories of the market that are declining. We do believe that we can continue to gain share even in those declining markets. At the same time we balance every dollar that we have incremental in terms of investing in new market opportunities or returning it to shareholders and that's a careful balance that we continue to have. In terms of our emerging portfolio of products as I said on the call, we are very pleased with the progress in terms of the growth rates of the emerging portfolio the all-flash arrays, the E series portfolio, the hybrid cloud solutions we're very pleased with the progress both in terms of the growth rates as well as the number of channel partners selling it, as well as the number of customers that are adopting multiple products from NetApp to the point you just made. So we will continue to stay disciplined. We have a disciplined market and strategic evaluation process that looks at our portfolio and compares it to the market trends and it's an ongoing evolution in a changing market, so thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is open.","Steve Milunovich","You talked about the Company in two pieces standalone storage and on the other side scale out software-defined in cloud, what percentage of the Company is in each bucket today and what do you expect maybe exiting the year in a couple of quarters?","George Kurian","Obviously, when we talked about traditional standalone storage systems we were talking about our 7-Mode operating system and the OEM business. I think when you look at the used cases for the E series through the branded channel there are a large number of third platform used cases that are built around the data center of the future. The Clustered ONTAP operating system is also part of the datacenter of the future combining scale out, software-defined and all-flash architectures to enable customers to operate their environments like cloud service providers. So traditional storage we were referring to were particularly around 7-Mode and OEM.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Andrew Nowinski","So I just like to ask about linearity in the quarter, I know you said product revenue was down 12% year-over-year, product gross margin was down I think impart due to higher discounting, but then your DSO was also spiked up which seems to imply the quarter maybe have been a little backend loaded and your guidance for the January quarter was a bit lower than street was expecting, so I guess when you look at both your metrics together it seems like you may have pulled in revenue into October quarter, so just wondering if you could provide any color on that dynamic and whether the sales pipeline for the January quarter is up on a year-over-year basis?","Nick Noviello","Andrew it's Nick. Let me get you started on that part of the first half activity as we talked about it back in May and then again in August on our calls was to rebuild pipeline, and the team has been doing a really important effort around just that, putting sales capacity and rebuilding channel partner relationship et cetera. So I think the work continues to go on there, that's not something that's going end, it's going to be something that continues. In terms of linearity in the quarter, the second quarter is a quarter that encompasses both the federal year-end in September and then our quarter end in October. When I look at our position at the end of the quarter, end of the quarter versus the sort of the end of the quarter a year ago is not much different there. So the linearity, I think is pretty normal in terms of overall what has happened year-on-year, I realize the pieces there is anomalies, I should say there are anomalies in this 14 week quarter from Q1 which we see every six years. So, hopefully, we will not have that type of thing talk about for another six years, but other than that the linearity is really consistent with what we expected and our position going into Q3 consistent with what we had going into Q3 even last year.","Operator","Our next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Rod Hall","George I guess I wanted to ask about the penetration CDOT you said it was 17% I think in this quarter, that's a little bit of a slowdown in penetration rate from the last quarter, so wanted to just get you to comment on that, you're talking about a pretty high transaction rate there so just trying to proposal of two things? And then also on that same line you said 30% of capacity is penetrated, can you guys give us the last two quarters of that number so we can compare that capacity penetration rate? Thanks.","George Kurian","So let me just say that our prior quarter was at 15% and the current quarter is at 17%. So we're not -- we don't see this as a slowdown, we see this as a constant sort of trajectory of customer environments transitioning from 7 to CDOT as well as new shipments getting deployed in our install base. When a new shipment gets sold by NetApp to the customer, it usually takes a little while before it actually shows up in our install based measuring system because of the time it takes for the customer to get it ready and deploy it. So sometimes the quarter boundary is not the perfect answer and so we see this as part of our ongoing trajectory. In terms of capacity deployed and capacity managed, we don't breakout those numbers they are essentially a measurement of the valuable of Clustered Data ONTAP in terms of being able to consolidate multiple systems and provide for large-scale data management in a very efficient fashion for customers, so we are pleased with that statistic as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Alexander of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Brian Alexander","Just going back to the geographic performance why do you suppose Europe has been so strong in the last couple of quarters, I think you said up 8% in constant currency, the macro backdrop at Europe obviously isn\u2019t all that favorable. So what\u2019s different about your business or your competitive position there that\u2019s allowing you to have a pretty strong growth in constant currency versus the performance in the Americas?","George Kurian","I would say there is two or three factors. The first is I want to thank our European sales leadership team. We have a deep experienced, well executing sales leadership team and a group of loyal channel partnerships who we have enabled with our technology sets and that has driven consistency in terms of the execution of the European organization. It is also translating our investments in the channel as well as the capacity investments we have made in the field into results. The second is we have introduced capabilities that were specific to the European market. So for example Clustered Data ONTAP there is a high availability configuration of it called Metro Cluster that is built for European, with European datacenters in mind and that gives us a far superior solution for Europe than any other competitor in the market. So it\u2019s both technology as well as great execution on the ground.","Operator","Our next question is from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers","I wanted to go and discuss the free cash flow guidance I believe last quarter you had talked about 15% free cash flow relative to revenue, I know that you\u2019ve tampered slightly your revenue outlook for this fiscal year but now you are talking about 15% for the back half of the year which by my math would adjust a deepened decline in the full year free cash flow contribution. I am just kind of wondering what necessarily has changed so significantly in the free cash flow expectation relative to the slight write-down on the income statement.","George Kurian","Yes, Aaron, actually if you go back to some of the discussion that actually happened in May we are talking about a cash from ops for the year that was going to be coming in, in let\u2019s say the high 100 million range if you backed through the math and then redeploying to shareholders over 1 billion so over 100% redeployed to shareholders. When I look at our forecast today they are moderately south of that but we are not talking about material numbers. So it is mid-teens is the expectation for the second half of the year. There has obviously been some pressure here in the first half, there has been some noise in terms of Q1 versus Q2 but overall for the year we should be generating a cash from ops range in the $800 million to $900 million range and that is not that significantly different from what we even talked about back in May.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Joe Wittine","George I think I want to appreciate the pragmatic view on market growth splitting out kind of the traditional on prem areas that are shrinking, I think you said 9% of the growth the portions converged all-flash et cetera are growing 20%. Give us a sense of what is NetApp\u2019s current breakdown I think it just helps in believe the story it helps kind of helps us to do the math as far as when top-line growth could return? Thanks.","George Kurian","I would say that first of all it\u2019s hard for us to breakout specific segments because essentially our all-flash arrays are part of our core Clustered Data ONTAP business. I would point you in terms of the places where the business is declining to 7-Mode and our OEM business as we said the 7-Mode business is down to 30% of new shipments down from a much, much larger number a year before, Clustered Data ONTAP is 70% of new shipments and so you can draw your conclusions in terms of when that transition will happen. The majority of our business has already transitioned to the go forward platform. I will leave you with that. The majority of our business has already transitioned to the go forward platforms in the E series branded versus OEM in the ONTAP and FAS business Clustered ONTAP versus 7-Mode.","Kris Newton","Thanks Joe. I\u2019ll give it back to George for a couple of summary comments.","George Kurian","Thank you for joining us today. I would like to conclude by saying we continue to make progress as we pivot towards growing parts of the market. Scale out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid could. Our key investment areas is sales capacity, channel traction and the acceleration of the transition of our install base to Clustered ONTAP are showing early results. Clustered ONTAP, flash and other emerging pieces of our portfolio are growing strongly although not yet to enough to offset the decline in our ONTAP 7-Mode business. Our customers are transforming themselves using digital technology connected with pervasive broadband networks and cloud computing to improve the efficiency of their business, their global business systems and better serve their customers. Data is at the heart of that transformation and where NetApp has a unique and valuable role to play. Feedback from customers and partners is overwhelmingly positive and reaffirms my strong conviction that our data fabric strategy is aligned to our customers\u2019 strategic technical direction for IT.","NetApp is the only Company that can help enterprises manage their data seamlessly across multiple cloud architectures with the scale and modern system architectures needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital era. NetApp is changing to position the Company for long-term growth. We are conducting a fundamental assessment of every aspect of our business, structure, portfolio and process, to reduce complexity and drive efficiency, while improving our overall velocity. We will build a stronger more efficient Company that solves customer challenges, while delivering profitability and earnings growth in a moderated IT spending and storage market.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kris Newton","Hello, and thank you for joining us on our Q3 fiscal year 2016 earnings call. With me today are CEO, George Kurian; and Interim CFO, Jeff Bergmann. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and a non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 and for fiscal year 2017, our expectations regarding future revenue growth, improved profitability, cash flow, effective tax rate and shareholder returns, our expectations about our ability to drive operational and financial performance and about the impact of the SolidFire acquisition and business, all of which involve risk and uncertainty.","Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including the macroeconomic environment, the overall growth rates for IT, our ability to successfully pivot to the growth areas of the market, our ability to expand our operating margin, our ability to reduce our cost structure within the planned timeframe and our ability to continue our capital allocation strategy and investment in strategic opportunities.","Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q, our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can also be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated.","I'll now turn the call over to George.","George Kurian","Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our Q3 performance reflects our strong focus on operational execution as well as continued challenges from a number of headwinds.","For the quarter we achieved our margin and EPS targets. However, we recorded lower than expected revenue. These mixed results reflect the impact of an uncertain and volatile macroeconomic environment, which is causing a slowdown in spending that became more evident in January.","Additionally, overall growth rates for enterprise IT remain under pressure, as customers shift some of their spending to the cloud. Despite these headwinds, we had a number of positives in the quarter. Our data fabric strategy and pivot towards the growth segments of the market, scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud continue to yield positive results.","Earlier this month we closed the SolidFire acquisition, positioning us to lead the rapidly growing All Flash array market. Before I go into greater depth on the progress we've made in these areas, I want to spend time on the fundamental changes we are undertaking to return NetApp to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns.","On prior calls I told you that I was driving a detailed inspection of the business. I have now concluded that formal review. Parts of our business are working well and growing, but we are managing through declines in other parts. We have many exciting innovative industry-leading products, strong relationships with customers and partners and a large growing installed base.","NetApp does not need to completely reinvent itself, but we do need to execute comprehensive and sustained transformation to deliver on our commitment to return to revenue growth and enhanced profitability and shareholder returns. We will take significant steps to streamline the business and further advance our pivot to the growth areas of the market in order to capture the full potential of NetApp.","To accomplish this we've adopted a plan with several key priorities. First, we have focused on the strategic solutions that represent our pivot to the growth segments of the market and are the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era. Second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining the business, even while investing for the future.","Third, we will provide greater visibility into the business and our revenue mix to demonstrate why we are so confident in our ability to capitalize on our strategic solutions. And fourth, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investing for the long-term growth of the business.","Let's start with our strategic solutions. As a baseline, our focus remains in enabling our customer success, as they navigate through their own IT transmissions, which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud solutions. Clustered ONTAP, branded E-Series, All Flash arrays, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight are the set of strategic solutions that are the basis of our pivot to the growth segments of the market.","The growth rate of our strategic solutions is strong, but as I have discussed, not yet sufficient to offset the headwinds from the mature areas of our business, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add-on. We expect that these headwinds will lessen, as we progress through fiscal year 2017.","As we emerge from FY '17, the transition to clustered ONTAP should be mostly behind us, as will the downward pressure that the transition has put on our add-on storage business. As OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode become a smaller part of our mix, we anticipate that our pivot towards the growth areas of the market will return the company to revenue growth albeit moderated.","During this transition period, we will maintain a sharp focus and execution, reduce our cost base and take additional steps to manage the trends in the storage industry. We will make transformational moves to become more focused, efficient and effective, while fundamentally lowering the cost structure of the company even as we invest in strategic opportunities, which brings us to our second priority, cost control.","We will utilize disciplined portfolio management to improve productivity and better align resources with opportunities, while simultaneously maximizing returns from the mature portions of our business. We must also streamline the business to increase our effectiveness and flexibility in responding to the rapidly changing market. All of this will expand operating margin.","We have launched a comprehensive program to reduce the cost base of our business by $400 million gross annually with run rate savings achieved by the end of fiscal year '17. We have already embarked on this initiative.","We have made decisions that streamline our business, such as consolidating our hardware engineering and manufacturing operations teams, implementing tighter controls on indirect spending and improving supply chain efficiency. These actions and lower variable compensation enabled us to lower our Q3 operating expenses by 8% sequentially.","Today we announced our restructuring and reduction in workforce of approximately 12% of total headcount. This action will generate annualized run rate savings of approximately $200 million against our gross target. We expect the majority of this workforce reduction to occur in fiscal Q4.","As these cost efficiencies materialize, we are reinvesting some of these savings into strategic solutions like SolidFire and productivity improvements, which will allow us to be more effective at a lower cost structure, yielding a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal year '17.","We are taking a thoughtful approach to the reductions, employing disciplined portfolio management and fundamentally changing the way we operate. Savings will be achieved through business transformation, including operational process redesign, organizational restructuring and realignment and further portfolio streamlining. We are also putting into place controls to ensure that these savings are sustained.","These transformational moves will better align our resources against the strategic opportunity and our cost structure to the near-term growth trajectory of the business. While we've been working to make our model more efficient for some time now, this comprehensive and sustained transformation will enable us to realize the benefit of our pivot to the growth areas of the market at a faster pace.","Looking past the streamlining and transformation phase into fiscal year '18 and beyond, we will continue our focus on productivity and the improvements in efficiency will more substantially materialize. Our non-GAAP operating margins will improve towards the high-end of our target range, inclusive of SolidFire.","By coupling the strength of our data fabric strategy and the benefits we deliver to customers with a more efficient and agile business, we can increase the value we generate for customers, partners, employees and shareholders. Overtime, we believe that the investments we've made in innovation and streamlining will enable us to grow at an accelerating pace with improved operating margin and cash flow.","Our third priority is transparency. The progress we've already made in our pivot towards the growth areas of the market has not been easy to measure from outside the company. To help provide visibility into this transition, we are providing greater clarity into the dynamics of our product revenue.","In Q3, our strategic solutions trusted ONTAP, branded E-Series, All Flash arrays, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight made up almost 55% of product revenue and grew 26% year-over-year. By contrast, product revenue from our mature solutions OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode an add-on declined 40% year-over-year, predominantly from the declines in OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode.","In Q2 FY '16 we reached a significant milestone, when the revenue from strategic solutions exceeded that of the mature ones. In other words, the products with the higher aggregate growth profile had a bigger proportion of our product revenue. We are getting closer to a mix, where our strategic solutions can drive a reacceleration of the business.","This shift in the composition of our product revenue is a good indicator of the progress we've made in our pivot to the growth areas of the market. This plus our strong software and hardware maintenance revenues create a solid foundation for NetApp. The tight alignment between our strategic solutions and our customers IT imperatives underscores our confidence that we will generate continued growth from this area of the business.","As part of their IT modernization efforts, customer's wants scale-out and software-defined storage functionality for the efficient management of data growth. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless data management across flash, disk and cloud footprints and across public and private clouds for enterprise applications, regardless of the underlying hardware.","Clustered ONTAP was deployed in almost 80% of FAS systems shipped in Q3, up from roughly 40% a year-ago. Unit shipments of Clustered ONTAP systems saw strong continued customer demand, growing roughly 70% year-over-year. The clustered ONTAP transition acceleration program, we put in place at the start of the year, is speeding the migration of install base customers, who are ready to upgrade both their systems and their software from ONTAP 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP.","Our FAS install base is growing and clustered ONTAP now represents 24% of installed systems. The installed base mix will continue to ship to clustered ONTAP, but you should not expect a linear progression.","These migrations are projects that must fit within the overall IT priorities and budgets of our customers, and we anticipate that the transition of the install base will happen over the course of years. Both the total number of customers and new to NetApp customers, who made clustered ONTAP purchases in Q3, grew by approximately 60% from Q3 last year.","Flash is becoming the de facto technology for primary workloads. Our EF All Flash arrays deliver the extreme performance for standalone applications that infrastructure buyers and application owners need. The All Flash FAS arrays have industry-leading data management services with a unified multi-protocol capability that appeals to infrastructure architects driving data center consolidation.","Customer demand for our All Flash arrays continues to grow. Our existing All Flash array business, inclusive of EF and All Flash FAS products and services, has accelerated to an almost $600 million annual run rate. To this strong foundation, we are excited to add SolidFire's, unique scale-out block storage architecture that is compelling for the cloud architect, master minding the next generation data center.","With this acquisition, NetApp is the clear technology leader in the All Flash array market with the broadest portfolio of All Flash arrays in the industry, addressing the diverse needs of enterprises and service providers, which cannot be adequately met by the one-size-fits-all compromise approach of our competitors.","Our Data Fabric solutions are successfully positioning us to help customers with leading-edge cloud deployments. A leading Software-as-a-Service provider in the Asia-Pacific region, created a next generation service for its customers, utilizing NetApp private storage for cloud, AltaVault and OnCommand Insight, connected to multiple hyperscale clouds for compute services.","They provide an outstanding customer experience and an enterprise solution built on a single modern platform with a consistent look and feel without the risk of single cloud dependency. By storing data on NetApp private storage, they can meet customer preference for a specific cloud provider as well as improve their ability to meet SLA guarantees by failing over to other clouds, when the primary cloud is unavailable.","The myriad efficiency of NetApp private storage also allows them to improve their profitability by effectively storing less data on tiers of flash, and creating rapid virtual copies for test and development during new customer acquisitions. Additionally, they can satisfy regulators by proving where data resides at all times for government, financial services and healthcare customers.","This is a great example of what I've discussed in the past, data is at the heart of the transmission our customers are going through to improve the efficiency of their businesses and better serve their customers. At the same time, they are reducing IT budgets, looking for simpler solutions and rethinking how they consume IT.","This evaluation is diverting spend towards transformational projects and architectures like scale-out, software-defined, flash, converge and hybrid cloud, where our data fabric strategy gives us a compelling advantage. NetApp is the only company able to span flash to disk to cloud, and the only company delivering the ability to manage data across multiple clouds and on-premises today.","Finally, I want to briefly touch on capital allocation, our fourth priority. I'll let Jeff get into the details, but in short, we are fully committed to executing our capital allocation programs and creating value for shareholders. We expect to complete our current share buyback authorization by the end of May 2018, as planned, and remain committed to our dividend program.","I am more confident than ever in NetApp's potential. While we must manage through a dynamic IT market and declines in our mature solutions, we have a clear plan and a lot of positives. We have a large and growing install base. Our data fabric strategy uniquely enables us to assist customers in achieving their strategic IT imperatives.","Our strategic solutions are greater than 50% of product revenue and growing. We are making substantial progress in the transition to clustered ONTAP. And we've just expanded our comprehensive All Flash array portfolio. We are keenly focused on our business model and managing our investments between our strategic and mature solutions.","The changes we are making to streamline the business and reduce the cost structure will enable investment and strategic opportunities, while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of profitability and cash flow. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.","I'll now turn it over to Jeff to take you through the numbers. Jeff?","Jeffrey Bergmann","Thank you, and good afternoon to everyone. I'd like to start by thanking George and the NetApp Board for the opportunity to step-in as Interim CFO. It's an exciting time of transformation for NetApp, as we streamline the business to become more focused and efficient, and at the same time pivot the company toward growth areas of the market and take advantage of the opportunities in front of us.","The team is energized to leverage the strength of our strategic solutions to bolster the company and ultimately drive growth. We have made good progress to date, and as you heard from George, are committed to providing you with greater visibility into the dynamics of our business.","With that said, let's move to the financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. I want to remind you that unless otherwise specified, I will be using non-GAAP metrics to discuss our financial results and guidance.","Q3 net revenues of $1.39 billion were down about 4% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. While there were indicators that strengthen our results, such as clustered ONTAP traction and rapid All Flash array adoption, which drove growth in our strategic solutions, our revenue performance felt short of our expectations.","The shortfall was a result of a combination of the macroeconomic uncertainty George talked about, that created the lengthening of deal cycles, greater than anticipated rate of decline in our mature business and mix shift to deferred revenue and FX headwinds of about 3 points year-over-year.","When we reiterated guidance in early January, our sales volume was in line with our forecast, which assumed a bank-end loaded quarter, consistent with historical performance and as is typical in the industry. However, after a moderate calendar year budget flush, that macroeconomic environment worsened and we saw an increase in the deferred mix of our business over the course of last two weeks of the quarter.","Product revenue declined 8% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. We saw higher than expected volume of software and hardware maintenance contract renewals, as some customers opted to delay equipment purchases. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues was up 2% year-over-year.","Now, to provide some context and better visibility into our business model, I'd like to walk through how we think about the strategic solutions revenue in software and hardware maintenance revenues coming together to create a foundation from which we can build.","Revenue from strategic solutions continues to show strong growth, and as George highlighted, is now more than 50% of our product revenue. The year-over-year decline in our mature solutions revenue is driving overall product revenue declines in the near-term. But the size and growth of the strategic solutions revenue gives us confidence in our strategy to drive overall product revenue growth in the future.","Looking at software and hardware maintenance revenues. I talked about the strength of our renewal business during the quarter, and as George said, 24% of our install base is running on clustered ONTAP. While the product revenue declines will ultimately pressure software and hardware maintenance revenues, the lengthening of product lifecycles, growth of our install base, rapidly increasing mix of clustered ONTAP install base, and high renewal volume create support for future software and hardware maintenance revenues.","Indirect revenue accounted for 78% of net revenues. Gross margin was 63.1% in the third quarter, above our previous guidance, reflecting favorable mix, partially offset by aggressive pricing. Product gross margin of 51.1% was down about 6 points year-over-year, reflecting about 2 point of FX and higher discounting.","Software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up about 2 points, largely reflecting higher contract renewal revenue, as well as services infrastructure cost efficiencies.","Operating expenses of $630 million decreased 12% year-over-year, reflecting 3 points of the FX benefit, lower headcount related compensation costs and their early work toward driving greater efficiency across the business, as George mentioned in his opening remarks. Operating margin of 17.6% was almost 1 point above our guidance.","Our effective tax rate was 14.9% and lower than our previous guidance, which reflects a change in the geographic mix of profits and its cumulative year-to-date impact. We expect our effective tax rate for Q4 to be approximately 16%. Our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was 296 million shares. Earnings per share was $0.70 within our guidance range.","Moving on to cash and balance sheet metrics. We ended the quarter with approximately $5 billion in cash in short-term investments with approximately 12% held by our domestic entities. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue increased $80 million sequentially and $16 million year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 20 and DSO was at 38 days.","We generated $355 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, up 29% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $314 million was about 23% in net revenues, up 217% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. We expect free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for Q4 to be slightly above 20%.","Now, I'd like to discuss share repurchases for a moment. In Q3, we repurchased approximately $85 million of our stock. This was less than we would have liked due to the events such as the SolidFire transaction, which reduced the number of days we could be in the market.","However, as George noted, we remain fully committed to completing our $2.5 billion share repurchase program by the end of May 2018, with [ph] $262 million is remaining by the end of May 2016. Additionally, we paid $52 million in cash dividends in the third quarter.","Today, we also announced next cash dividend of $0.18 per share of the company's common stock, which will be paid on April 27, 2016. Overall, we are confident in our allocation of capital between growth initiatives and shareholder returns, as we continue to execute on our transformation strategy.","Looking forward to guidance. Given the increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment, continued shifts in enterprise IT spending and our own work in transforming the company, we are tempering our forecast.","For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting a revenue range of $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion. Given the aggressive pricing environment, we expect gross margins to decline to approximately 61.5%, driven by higher discounting, which will be partially offset by cost savings initiatives.","Looking at operating margin, we are transforming the company in order to streamline the business, improve efficiency, become more focused and enhance our ability to rapidly address the changing market. Our initiatives will fundamentally change the way we do business by centralizing similar activities across functions, optimizing geographic location resources and consolidating suppliers.","We are better positioning NetApp for near and long-term success, while reducing our cost structure across both cost of revenues and OpEx and ensuring that the changes we make are sustainable. To minimize disruption, the pace of these changes will be dictated by the company's preparedness for each transformative initiative.","As George mentioned, we're driving to achieve a gross run rate savings of $400 million by the end of fiscal 2017, which will include the previously announced discontinuance of our flash array product line. We plan to use these cost savings to minimize erosion of margins in a price competitive environment.","We will reinvest some of the gross savings into strategic opportunities, such as SolidFire and productivity improvements, yielding a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017. While George touched upon several initiatives that are already underway, we will provide more specifics around additional initiatives, as they are executed.","As a step towards lowering our cost and rewiring the company, we will initiate a headcount reduction of approximately 12% during the fourth quarter. We expect to realize Q4 savings of just over $30 million, resulting in a Q4 operating margin of approximately 15% and earnings per share target range of $0.55 to $0.60 for the fourth quarter, including the impact of the SolidFire acquisition. We expect a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $60 million to $70 million in Q4 relating to this action.","Finally, to help with your models, I'd like to provide some color around the impact of SolidFire on our outlook. As you know, the acquisition closed on February 2. We funded the transaction through a short-term loan of $870 million. We intend to integrate SolidFire into our global operating structure and expect to retire the acquisition debt with our global earnings by the beginning of Q3 FY '17.","In Q4, we expect SolidFire to reduce operating margin by about 3 points, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 15%. Looking forward to FY '17, we expect our strategic plans for SolidFire to contribute about 2 points of revenue growth and be dilutive to operating profit by about 2 points and to earnings per share by $0.28 to $0.30.","This is at the high-end of the guidance range that we gave you on the acquisition call as that range includes benefit of flash array discontinuance, which we are now reporting as part of the overall cost reduction plan. We anticipate that SolidFire will be accretive in FY '18.","The IT environment is changing rapidly and we've provided a lot of additional content to give you more insight into how it's impacting us and the actions we're taking to adapt. Let me summarize the four themes around this transformation that I want to ensure that you take away from this call.","First, underlying our topline results there is a strong strategic business that is material and growing. Second, we are significantly reducing the cost structure of our core NetApp business, aligning our resources to the market opportunity, which will expand operating margin.","Third, we are committed to providing greater transparency and visibility into our business. And fourth, we're committed to our capital allocation strategy of providing a meaningful dividend that grows over time and executing a robust share repurchase program, while investing in the long-term growth of the business.","With that, I would like to hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?","Kris Newton","We'll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thank you for your cooperation. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research.","Steven Fox","George, just on the cost saving initiatives and the $400 million total, can you sort of foot that versus what you just announced? In other words, how much of the $400 million was realized to date? And if you, I assume that's a gross number, so if you net that out what were the savings? And then specifically, where were you getting them from? And along those lines, I guess, there's some product mix issues that are helping you as well, can you address that in terms of just how your margins are benefiting?","George Kurian","The total program is a comprehensive program that encompasses across the board, business process redesign, organizational restructuring and realignment and further streamlining of the portfolio. The total dollar savings that we are going after, the gross savings, between the end of Q3 of fiscal '16 and the end of fiscal '17 is a gross number of $400 million in cost savings.","The first step in that program is the restructuring action that we are announcing today, and which will be complete in Q4. Within Q4, we will be recording about $30 million of savings from the action itself, which over a full year annualized run rate is about $200 million.","Steven Fox","Just to be clear there, that's without any mix benefits, that's just all costs going forward, then the mix would be separate?","George Kurian","That's correct.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Steve. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Kisner of Jefferies LLC.","James Kisner","So you said that 55% of your product revenue I think in Q3 was strategic solutions. I'm just wondering if could you share some rough thoughts on what you think that composition might be as you exit fiscal '17 that gives you confidence that you'll be set up to return revenue growth in FY '18.","George Kurian","I think as we indicated, we are providing greater visibility into the product mix between our mature products and our strategic products. I think we've also given you the size and relative growth rates of each of those categories. We're not going to provide guidance beyond that in terms of the specific buckets.","Add-on storage, just to be clear, is not going to go to zero from the mature bucket. From the mature bucket the declines are primarily from 7-Mode and OEM. The add-on piece of the mature bucket is essentially going through a transition from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP, and so will be the majority of the mature bucket going forward.","Kris Newton","Thanks, James. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Maynard Um of Wells Fargo.","Maynard Um","I just wanted to make sure I understood the use of cash. I understand that you're still committed to the capital allocation program, but should we anticipate that you'll pause the share repurchase as you focus on paying down the debt. And it also feels like you have a broad portfolio to address the growth areas of the market. So should we read into those comments that a use of cash wouldn't be to do further M&A?","Jeffrey Bergmann","So we do plan to resume our stock repurchase activity in the quarter. Our stock price, obviously, is attractive at these levels and we will look forward to be opportunistic. I would say that in terms of M&A, we are really focused on integrating SolidFire and so our focus will be to invest in that area rather than focus on M&A at this point.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Maynard. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall of JPMorgan.","Rod Hall","I just wanted to circle back to these percentages of strategic and mature revenue that you guys talked about and the growth rates. I guess if I assume that the balance of the revenue, the 55% is mature, and I just multiply it by growth rates, I get the wrong number. So I'm wondering if you could help us kind of reconcile that percentages in growth rates back to the reported product revenue growth rate, so that we understand is there another segment in there you're not talking about? And what is the growth rate in that segment? And then I have one follow-up as well.","George Kurian","The product revenue numbers essentially are broken out in 100% between the mature pieces and the strategic pieces. I would tell you that in the mature pieces, you should be cognizant of the facts that the declines are primarily in the 7-Mode and OEM pieces of the mature bucket.","The add-on storage numbers are essentially a large percentage of the mature bucket and they are not deteriorating at the rate of 7-Mode or OEM. They're essentially going through the transition from 7 to clustered ONTAP. And so will be a relatively stable business, will also be affected by the trends of disc to flash. But I would just tell you that a 100% of our product revenues are either categorized as mature or strategic.","Rod Hall","George, just on my follow-up. If you multiply the things out, so 55% product revenue by 26% growth and then the remaining 45% via 40% decline you get like 4% decline, which isn't the same thing that you guys reported. So maybe offline you guys could elaborate or later in the call. And then it would also be helpful if you could those growth rates that you call out for this quarter last quarter, so we can see the trajectory like are we seeing stabilization of the decline in the mature stuff?","Jeffrey Bergmann","Real quickly, I think the reason why the math may not work is the percentages that we are calculating are based upon our gross revenue for those product lines, but that sit within mature and strategic.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Rod. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner","I just want to clarify; I think you said that the All Flash array business was now for you $600 million run rate, which I assume does not include SolidFire? And how much SolidFire revenue are you expecting or including in the guidance for fiscal 4Q?","Jeffrey Bergmann","So the $600 million run rate on the flash business is just EF and our AFF product lines. That doesn't include SolidFire. We just have minimal revenue planned in Q4 for SolidFire in our plan.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Sherri. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian White of Drexel Hamilton.","Brian White","You talked about business slowing a bit at the end of January. Maybe you can just walk us around the world and give us a view of what you're seeing by geography and also by vertical?","George Kurian","So our business reflected the general commentary in the market about the macro. Asia Pacific, particularly the economy is dependant on China, as well as Japan saw a pretty choppy business in January. Certainly sectors like oil and gas and countries that are dependent on oil and gas were also affected.","The service provider business in the U.S. is down as many telcos are divesting of their cloud business and reevaluating their approach to the data center business. And as we noted before, 2015 has been a year where the U.S. Fed has lower IT spending as well as shifted priorities within this spending envelope to initiatives such as cyber security and some on the cloud.","Kris Newton","Thanks Brian. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","I guess just from the strategic piece of the revenue that's growing 20% plus, basically the gross numbers. Could you just talk about -- give us sense on how much of that is potentially just cannibalizing your own legacy or mature piece of business versus what's net-new? And then the strategic bucket itself, do you think its margin and free cash flow accretive versus the overall business or it's dilutive to your model?","George Kurian","First of all, in terms of clustered ONTAP the net new-to-NetApp customers and total customers on clustered ONTAP grew strongly 60% year-on-year. So we are winning more than our fair share of both new customers, as well as transformational activity within our existing customers using our strategic solutions.","I would say that the EF-Series, the All Flash arrays are also primarily growing in parts of the market that we historically did not serve the high performance fiber channel segment of the market. So we feel good about the new solutions being allowing us to get wallet share in both existing customers as well as net new-to-NetApp customers.","Jeffrey Bergmann","Just to add on the margin, we think that the shift between the mature and strategic is pretty much neutral in terms of gross margin.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Amit. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz of Barclays.","Mark Moskowitz","I want to talk maybe bigger picture, just given this kind of perennial cost cutting and kind of almost the morale busting job force reduction you're announcing today, are you signaling despite your optimism around some of these strategic imperatives that longer-term the storage market is going to decrease and compress for other reasons outside of your control, whether it's from the cloud displacement or just because of data-reduction technologies, because I'm just trying to reconcile some of your optimism around why you're going to cut more muscle from the bone?","George Kurian","We are going through, as I indicated on the call, we are going through a transition in our business from the traditional to the strategic segments of our business. We feel very good about the strategic portions of our business growing double-digits. At the same time, we want to manage the business responsibly, as we go through the transition and set up the company to be able to generate margins and shareholder returns in a moderated growth environment.","We are not sacrificing investments in growth areas. For example, we are continuing to invest in our All Flash arrays, we continue to invest in clustered ONTAP acceleration, we continue to invest in strategic solutions like SolidFire and our hybrid cloud solutions. We're just getting much more focused on the company as a company on the parts of the market that are really growing.","Jeffrey Bergmann","Yes, Mark, I would just add a little briefly on that that we've done a pretty extensive analysis on our operating model and compared ourselves to the top performing companies. And this is really about aligning ourselves with the profile that we need to address the market going forward and feel confident in where we're ending up.","Kris Newton","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS.","Steve Milunovich","George, you kind of positioned the recovery beginning in '18, so I know it's premature perhaps. But when you think about '17, it sounds like you might be kind of in a mid-teens operating margin, you're going to have some SolidFire revenues, so I don't know revenue maybe flattish to slightly down. Just curious, if you are prepared to make any broad comments about what '17 looks like before things accelerated to '18?","George Kurian","We're not going to provide any comments and guidance on '17. We'll give you that when we're ready to do so. Right now, we're focused on streamlining the business and doing so in a responsible fashion, so that we can manage the risk, but also make sure that we can take the strategic actions that set us up for a better productivity model going forward.","Steve Milunovich","Do you view it as a transition year?","George Kurian","'17 as I said, if you do the evaluation of our strategic solutions and our mature parts of the portfolio, we still have some transition ahead of us.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Steve. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha","I just had a clarification, on the $400 million of cost savings, is it right to think $200 million OpEx and $200 million of cost of goods sold [indiscernible] clarification. And then my deeper question is --.","Kris Newton","Kulbinder, we can barely hear you.","Kulbinder Garcha","My question is on the $400 million of cost savings, how does that split between OpEx and COGS?","George Kurian","We would tell you once we get through the cost savings approach. As I said, we've got programs in flight, some of which are already in flight, some of which have been part of the Q4 restructuring action. We'll give you more detailed updates as we execute the transformation program.","Jeffrey Bergmann","Just to add a little color to that, the $400 million is really -- we expect to accomplish that during FY '17 and part of Q4, so that is really a run rate exit level for FY '17.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Kulbinder.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Stifel.","Aaron Rakers","I want to go into the revenue a little bit. As you guys go through this transformation, it looks like you still have about high-30% kind of 40% contribution of your revenue coming off the balance sheet software entitlement maintenance, as well as the maintenance service revenue. So as you see the declines in your traditional or mature businesses, how are we to think about the progression of that revenue as we look into fiscal '17?","George Kurian","First of all, I'll let Jeff provide some more details. But our install base is growing. The install base of systems that are under maintenance contracts with NetApp is growing, both reflecting a longer lifespan of utilization of existing systems and their strategic value-serving, high-performance, data-rich applications in our customers, but also the fact that our strategic solutions are growing. So our overall install base of systems is growing, which is supportive of the fact that our maintenance revenues are strong.","Jeffrey Bergmann","I would just add to that. We just think that that provides us a strong foundation for that revenue stream. We clearly have an install base that's growing, and with cDOT at 24% and growing, we think that gives us confidence in that as we move forward.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Aaron. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citigroup.","Jim Suva","Can you help us understand how we should quantify or measure the milestones of the SourceFire acquisition, whether that be profitability or breakeven of earnings or revenues, how can we measure the integration? And do you actually have a timeline for breakeven?","George Kurian","SolidFire will be accretive in fiscal year '18. We'll provide more insight into the program, as we integrate that and as we lay out our plans for fiscal year '17. But at the moment, we'd see that SolidFire will be accretive in fiscal year '18.","Kris Newton","Thank you. Next questions please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray.","Andrew Nowinski","So sorry if I missed it, but can you give us any color on your new customer growth relative to prior quarters, because that may give us a better sense of how compelling clustered ONTAP is relative to some of the other next-gen vendors like Nutanix and Tintri and others?","George Kurian","We've got good growth quarter-on-quarter as well as year-on-year. As I said, year-on-year net new-to-NetApp, as well as cDOT customers in aggregate grew 60% year-on-year. And so we feel good about both expanding footprints in existing customers, as well as access to net-new customers.","SolidFire, for example, allows us to be able to be competitive in customer environments that have historically valued the extreme simplicity, as well as the efficiency of hyper conversion environments. We've seen good success with SolidFire's base of customers that are able to meet that design point. So we think that both clustered ONTAP and SolidFire give us good footprints in both traditional as well as emerging categories.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Andrew. Next question.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brian Alexander of Raymond James.","Bob Hahn","This is actually Bob Hahn calling in for Brian. I just wanted to ask a quick question regarding your 7-Mode install base. I know last quarter you mentioned that Q2 marked the first time that you did not experience growth in the 7-Mode install base. Now, I was wondering if that install base is now declining, and do you think that you'll be able to convert over a lot of these customers or how confident are you that you can convert over these customers over time?","George Kurian","The aggregate install base of 7-Mode and clustered ONTAP FAS Systems is actually growing. So we feel good, not only about the overall install base, but if you think about the percentage of the install base that its clustered ONTAP, it's at 24%, up from 17% a quarter ago, so strong growth in terms of the install base and execution.","I would tell you that the pace of those transitions are IT projects in our customer environments, right. And so to the extent that enterprise IT spending overall is pressured there will be some tactical moves that customers might make to just stay on 7 for a period of time before they cut over.","The programs that we initiated at the start of the year, clustered ONTAP accelerations program have seen strong growth. We've already exceeded our expectations for the year with that program in terms of customers, the total volume of transactions, as well as the number of resellers engaged in moving customers, so we feel good.","Kris Newton","Thanks Bob. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Srini Nandury of Summit Research.","Srini Nandury","Can you talk about the competitive environment, who is being aggressive and what's your outlook for the startups who are competing in the space?","George Kurian","I would say that the competitive environment, we have seen some more price discounting from select players in the market. We think that the dynamic of them discounting is relatively unchanged. HP, HDS, they are the key players that lack the innovation value, so they are being aggressive on price to compete.","We don't see much change from the startups. I think Nimble has continued to retrench mostly into the SMB market. Pure is unchanged in terms of its competitive stance and EMC is challenged with the transaction that they are about to undertake. So we do see some opportunities where we have been able to take footprints from EMC, given the lack of clarity in terms of their roadmap going forward.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Srini. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin of Pacific Crest Securities.","Brent Bracelin","George, I had a follow-up on the mature products segment. As you think about that 44% decline that you saw this quarter, how much would you attribute to a pause, macro-related concern versus a more accelerated shift towards this industry transitioning into flash and cloud? If you could help us parse out that decline and how much of it is kind of a change in the environment and the demand environment versus more of an acceleration to these transitions?","George Kurian","I would say, there was certainly a percentage of it that was rather than doing technology refresh, it was basically moved towards a maintenance contract or a service agreement, that said here I'm going to wait until I see what happens in the macro before undertaking a big project. I don't think that represents a shift to the cloud, it's just I'm not ready to take on a major capital project at this point in time. It's much more of the discussion threat there.","I think in terms of the migrations from our existing platforms to solid state, I would say that the strength of our solid-state portfolio is not just a transition from our existing footprint, right. We are actually getting a lot of new customers, because the majority of our footprint is essentially with solid-state arrays is in high-performance fiber-channel environments that we historically did not have a big landscape in.","So I would say that some of the declines are from pauses, some of them are from our natural migrations to clustered ONTAP and some of it is essentially going through a period of, I've got enough things going on in my business, where I've acquired new platforms and I'm waiting to consume them.","Kris Newton","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski","I think you said that you had a $600 million run rate in the flash products. And on the call in December, I think you cited $370 million, which would imply about 60% quarter-on-quarter growth. I just wanted to clarify that I've got that correctly? And then in terms of my question, I wanted to ask about your strategy for addressing the hyper converge segment of the market?","George Kurian","First of all, your analysis is correct, Simona, on the sequential growth rate. The second is, in terms of the hyper converge market, we see what customers really want is essentially simplified provisioning and operational management, a relatively simple pay-as-you-go building block architecture. And you will see us address those customer needs with both the SolidFire architecture, which is built with a scale-out, simplified design right out of the get-go as well as some exciting new innovations in the flex spot lineup.","Kris Newton","Next question?","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna Financial.","David Ryzhik","This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini. Just going to April guidance, April quarter guidance for gross margins, it looks like its down 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter and it seems like higher discounting is the reason. But earlier on the call you mentioned that the dynamics of discounting is unchanged. So just wanted to clarify, does this mean that pricing pressure has basically accelerated in the April quarter? And should we anticipate that in both the strategic and mature or mostly in the mature segment of the business?","George Kurian","These are year-on-year numbers. I think we are being cautious about the mix, we're being cautious about the macroeconomic environment and typically the discounting behavior in our yearend quarter.","Jeffrey Bergmann","And there's also just an unfavorable product mix involved in that as well.","Kris Newton","I'm going to pass it over to George for some final comment.","End of Q&A","George Kurian","In closing, let me reiterate my confidence in NetApp's potential. We have a lot of positives with our strategic solutions that are the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era. We have a large and growing install base, our data fabric strategy uniquely enables us to assist customers in achieving their strategic IT imperatives. Our strategic solutions are greater than 50% of product revenue and growing. We are making substantial progress in the transition to clustered ONTAP. And we've just expanded our comprehensive All Flash array portfolio.","While we must manage through a dynamic IT market and declines in our mature solutions, we have a clear plan to drive long-term growth and profitability. We are focused on driving continued growth of the strategic solutions. We are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining the business. We are providing greater transparency to give you better visibility into the basis of our confidence. And finally, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy.","Thank you. I look forward to giving you further updates next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

Welcome to NetApp's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.","I would now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you for joining us on our Q2 fiscal year 2018 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com, along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table, and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2018 and our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections.","Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including global political macroeconomic and market conditions and our ability to expand our total available market, enhance our product offerings, execute new business models, manage our gross profit margins, capitalize on our market position, maintain execution, and continue our capital allocation strategy.","Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2017 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated.","I'll now turn the call over to George.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I am very pleased to report another strong quarter with revenue above the midpoint of our guidance range and gross margin, operating margin, and earnings per share all above our guidance. We saw a solid demand environment in all geographies and strong customer interest in our industry-leading solutions.","I am proud of our continued progress in transforming NetApp to deliver sustained profitable growth. Our strong performance reflects our customers' commitment to NetApp and their clear and growing preference for the value of our Data Fabric strategy. We are undoubtedly out executing our competition on all fronts.","In the second quarter, we launched innovative new products and grew our business in new areas. It's been particularly exciting to see our cloud strategy pay off with our expanded relationship with Microsoft Azure and the industry's first Azure enterprise NFS service.","In the new era of IT, driven by digital transformation and defined by the ubiquitous hybrid clouds, IoT and machine learning, NetApp is uniquely positioned as the leader in helping organizations liberate and unleash their data for maximum business impact. We enable customers to meet the exponential data growth of the digital era where they must manage a complex hybrid world with data in the data center, the cloud and in edge computing, and externally linked applications and platforms.","Unlike competitors' approaches, which are siloed and do not embrace the cloud, we help organizations unify their data across the widest range of cloud and on-premises environments to realize its full value for competitive advantage. Data is at the heart of company's digital transformation, and we are winning because we are enabling customers' success through data. No one matches our expertise in data management, our leadership in growing market segments and our open ecosystem approach. Our advantage is the result of decades of software-based innovation, strategic focus and the ability to partner effectively.","Before giving you an update on the set of strategic solutions that are tightly aligned to customers' IT imperatives, I want to give a brief update on the dynamics in our mature solutions. Consistent with our plan, the headwinds for mature solutions continue to lessen. In the second quarter, product revenue from mature solutions declined 3% year-over-year. The transition from 7-mode to Clustered ONTAP is behind us. Our add-on hardware business is growing, and we have a renewed focus on hardware and software OEM opportunities. In the coming quarters, the headwinds for mature solutions could abate and could possibly provide some support for additional top line growth.","As a part of our transformation, we have aligned tightly to our customers' IT imperatives as they harness the power of cloud, build next-generation data centers and modernize their existing storage infrastructure. This has resulted in a differentiated strategic solutions portfolio focused on the growth areas of the market. And we continue to bring innovative solutions to more customers in more ways.","As I noted last quarter, we have already transitioned our business away from the declining segments to the data-driven high-growth segments of all-flash arrays, converged and hyper-converged infrastructure and hybrid cloud. The success of our strategic direction is evident in the continued momentum in our strategic solutions, which were 69% of net product revenue in Q2, up 23% year-over-year.","Customers are moving to all-flash arrays as they modernize existing data centers and build next-generation data centers to lower total cost of ownership while gaining greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications. This shift creates enormous new opportunity for us as we penetrate our installed base and displace competitors' equipment with our cloud-integrated all-flash solution.","We continue to substantially outpace the growth of the all-flash array market and competitors, both large and small. In Q2, our all-flash array business, inclusive of All-Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services, grew about 60% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $1.7 billion.","Our strength in flash is also driving our success in SAN and converged infrastructure markets. Our clustered storage solutions have substantial and structural technological advantages over competitors' SAN products. This is enabling us to gain share in the SAN market, both in new customer acquisitions and in greater share of wallet within existing customers as we displace legacy competitive SAN installations.","The all-flash FlexPod again helped to strengthen our number two position in the converged infrastructure market and contributed to the 20% year-over-year growth of FlexPod revenue reported in IDC's Quarterly Converged Systems Tracker for calendar Q2 2017. We continue to outpace and win against full stack vendors with our best-of-breed solution.","In Q2, we delivered new innovations that further strengthened our leadership position in the all-flash array market. The latest version of ONTAP offers 40% increased performance over earlier versions, helps companies increase capacity savings by 30% and offers stronger security and new compliance capabilities.","This expands upon the performance leadership of the world-record SPEC SFS performance benchmark that we set earlier in the quarter. The new EF570 all-flash array designed specifically for performance-intensive workloads such as big data analytics, technical computing and video surveillance, leads both the SPC-1 and SPC-2 benchmarks for price performance and is the first enterprise all-flash array to support NVMe over InfiniBand for ultra-low-latency applications.","The newest SolidFire Element OS helps customers align business goals to IT service levels with new user-defined quality of service policies to further simplify performance management in rapidly evolving private clouds. NetApp's SnapMirror integration supports data movement from Element OS systems to ONTAP systems across the Data Fabric.","These SolidFire innovations are incorporated in NetApp HCI, the first enterprise-scale hyper-converged infrastructure solution which began shipping at the end of Q2. We enable customers to overcome the limitations of inflexible first-generation HCI products that strand resources, throttle the performance acquired by next-generation applications and are not able to consolidate workloads.","Customers are excited that we are delivering on all of the promises of HCI and we are seeing strong demand for this offering. More and more customers, partners and service providers are choosing NetApp because of our hybrid cloud strategy. Our recent industry-first announcement with Microsoft Azure is clear evidence of the strength of this strategy. This enterprise NFS service in the cloud will be delivered natively in Azure and powered by NetApp. Users will access this service directly through the Azure console and continue to get the scale, performance and reliability offered by NetApp's leading data services.","NetApp is unique in its approach to collaborating with the hyperscalers and has defined the best-in-class model for helping our joint customers deploy hybrid cloud. We have partnerships with all the leading hyperscalers, which enable us to deliver NetApp enterprise value through their massive cloud infrastructures. These relationships allow us to monetize customers' use of the cloud and increase our opportunity to expand our market share in the on-premises market.","I could not be more excited about the possibilities created by this part of our business. We are building on a solid foundation that is generating profitable growth today and positions us for continued growth in the future. We remain focused on three priorities. We are aligning to the high-growth areas of the market and reaching more customers in more ways. We are continuing our disciplined approach to realign our resources against the biggest opportunities and to focus on productivity to expand our innovation. And we are maintaining our focus on capital allocation, balancing shareholder returns with investment in the business for long-term growth.","Our second quarter results are a strong indicator that the transformation of NetApp remains on track and is accelerating our success with customers. It's clear that our strong execution and Data Fabric strategy are enabling us to build deeper and more strategic relationships with companies around the world.","At our recent Insight User Conference, thousands of customers and partners shared their excitement for our strategic direction and long-term vision. We expect our improved momentum to continue throughout the year. We are the data authority for the hybrid cloud, planning for the future, leveraging our technologies and scale to create new businesses, expanding our total available market and creating shareholder value.","Before turning it over to Ron, I'd like to thank the NetApp team for your focus, commitment to transformation and the exceptional results that we are delivering together. Ron?","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers today.","Now let's get started. NetApp again delivered strong operating results across the P&L, underscoring robust customer demand for a broad portfolio of innovations. Our sharp focus, market-leading innovation and disciplined execution are clearly yielding positive results.","Q2 net revenues of $1.42 billion grew more than 6% year-over-year, including 1 point of tailwind from currency, and we're above the midpoint of our guidance range. Product revenue of $807 million increased 14% year-over-year. Q2 marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year product revenue growth, demonstrating our successful pivot to the growth areas in the market.","The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues of $615 million declined 2% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially. As expected, the year-over-year headwind in services revenue decreased in the second quarter. Although we generally don't provide services revenue guidance, as I said on our last call, we continue to expect the year-over-year headwind from services revenue to lessen and ultimately return to growth early next fiscal year.","We are confident in these expectations given our strong product revenue growth and the progress we are making in service renewal execution. Gross margin of 64.3% was well above our guidance range. Product gross margin of 51.8% increased 3.6 points year-over-year, reflecting the benefit from improved sales discipline, some onetime items and currency.","Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased about 2 points year-over-year. Operating expense of $642 million increased 1% year-over-year and 1% sequentially due primarily to higher variable compensation and currency.","As a percentage of net revenue, operating expenses of 45% represented over 2 points of improvement year-over-year, reflecting improved leverage from our ongoing transformation efforts. Operating margin of 19.1% increased almost 4 points year-over-year and was above our guidance range due to higher revenue and better than expected gross margin.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.4% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 275 million. EPS again exceeded guidance. At $0.81, it was $0.09 above the high end of our guidance range due to higher revenue and improved gross margins.","We closed Q2 with $6 billion in cash and short-term investments with 16% held by our domestic entities. This increase in domestic cash was temporary, reflecting the additional $800 million of bonds we issued in late September in order to retire the bonds we had coming due in December. After Q2 quarter-end, on November 3, we retired early the $750 million in bonds.","In Q2, we repurchased $150 million of our shares and paid approximately $54 million in cash dividends. Since 2013, we've returned over $6.5 billion to shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs.","Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which will be paid on January 24, 2018. To reiterate, we are committed to completing by the end of May 2018 the remaining $494 million of the share repurchase program that we announced in February 2015. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue was down 1% year-over-year showing improvement from Q1 fiscal 2018.","Our cash conversion cycle of negative 10 days improved 19 days year-over-year, reflecting a 21-day increase in days payable outstanding, partially offset by a two-day increase in days inventory outstanding. DSO at 37 days was flat year-over-year.","As I said in the past, we continue to exercise our deep business and technical partnerships with our SSD suppliers. We have enough on hand and committed supply of SSDs to meet our requirements well into next fiscal year.","Q2 cash flow from operations was $314 million, an increase of 99% year-over-year. We generated strong free cash flow of $285 million in the quarter, which represents 20% of net revenues and is an increase of 179% year-over-year.","Now the guidance. For Q3, we expect net revenues to range between $1.425 billion and $1.575 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a 6.8% increase year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margins of approximately 62.5% to 63.5%, reflecting a higher mix of product revenue quarter-to-quarter. We expect operating margins of approximately 20%. And finally, we expect earnings per share for the third quarter to range between $0.86 and $0.94 per share.","Looking at the second half of fiscal 2018, we remain confident in the guidance we provided on our prior call. To reiterate, we expect our typical seasonal patterns with revenue dollars increasing each quarter. Though we overachieved in Q2, we continue to expect our year-over-year growth rate to accelerate in the second half of the year.","We expect gross margin to be at the high end or slightly above the 62% to 63% range we've previously communicated and operating margin to be at the high end of the 18% to 20% range that we guided. Further, we remain committed to delivering low-double-digit EPS growth for the year and free cash flow in the range of 19% to 21% of revenue.","As I outlined during our Analyst Day in April, we are planning the long-term business for low-single-digit revenue growth in order to keep our operating expenses in line. However, as we articulated, there are many reasons we could and should outperform our long-term revenue plan.","Based on our first half results and Q3 guidance, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth this year with the upside flowing straight through to operating margin.","In closing, we are proud of our Q2 results. We delivered over 6% year-over-year revenue growth yielding a 35% increase in year-over-year EPS, clearly demonstrating the leverage in our business model. With our sharp focus, market-leading innovation and disciplined execution, we continue to drive sustained results.","With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","We'll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Thank you for your cooperation. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Good afternoon. 14% product growth, obviously, is very impressive. I know there's a number of factors that go into that, George. But you comment on the fact that you were able to implement a new sales plan this year which you weren't able to do last year and to what degree your go-to-market changes, including sales and marketing, are impacting your growth rate?","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","I think we're very, very pleased with the performance of our sales team. We saw exceptional execution across all of the different geographies and all of the different segments of the business. And we are extraordinarily \u2013 see very, very good momentum. We have a differentiated product portfolio. We have strength in all of our different channels of distribution. Our Data Fabric strategy is resonating with customers and the sharp focus of our field organization gives us extraordinary confidence in the business looking forward.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger of JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC","Yes, thank you. Could you give us some metrics around the HCI platform, what kind of growth and maybe adoption rate you're seeing?","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","We introduced the hyper-converged platform in October just this past month. We are excited at the demand that we've seen for the product. It has exceeded our expectations. We also booked some orders and we're focused on converting the rest of our pipeline this quarter. So we've got really good momentum. It's too early to break it out. And we see a lot of customer interest. We have a differentiated offering, delivering on the promise that hyper-converged gave customers with an enterprise-grade solution.","Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you, Erik. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into the continued growth that you've seen in the flash business, which has been very impressive. George, you've talked a lot about your ability to kind of gain incremental wallet share and customers. So I think it would be helpful to understand, as you look back over the past few quarters, how much of your momentum in all-flash is coming out of your existing installed base versus, let's say, net new customer or wallet share wins, and how maybe that's changed over the last few quarters. Thank you.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","We continue to see very, very good momentum displacing competition to gain wallet share. One of our competitive programs has seen continued increases in the number of competitive displacements per day. This quarter, we saw more than two competitive displacements per day, which is up substantially from the numbers we reported the last quarter. The majority of our flash footprint is net new wallet share in customers at the expense of legacy frame SAN arrays from our competitors like HP, IBM and EMC.","We still see substantial room to run. We are still in the early innings of flash adoption in our customer base. We have an extraordinarily differentiated flash portfolio, as I mentioned in my comments. We have several world-record performance benchmarks, a deeply differentiated software portfolio, and we continue to see strong momentum going forward.","Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you. Congratulations.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you, Aaron. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. I understand it is early in the HCI market. But, as you have said, you've got a differentiated approach. So, how should we think about your expectations in terms of how to weave the HCI contribution in over, let's say, fiscal 2019 or calendar 2018? I want to take a longer-term perspective on how to place it into the overall business. Thank you.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","We're not providing guidance for fiscal 2019. As Ron mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are raising the guidance for the second half of the year. So, as we see continued acceleration in the business and, for the full year, as we said, we would guide to mid-single digits, up from low-single digits.","I won't break out the hyper-converged. I'll just say it's part of that up-leveling of the number. And we feel very good about the offering we have in the market and the momentum we're seeing.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Simon. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is open.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Trying to keep it to one question here; I want to get a sense if you can help us out because we're probably expecting some investors to say this is as good as it gets. And obviously, your tone and tenor and guidance suggest otherwise. George, how should we think about the enterprise NFS opportunity? Is that something that could be additive to the business model in calendar 2018? Or is that more of a 2019 phenomenon?","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","That's a 2019 phenomenon. The enterprise Azure NFS service, we are very, very excited at the prospects to expand our reach to new customers in more ways and partnering with one of the world's leading hyperscale cloud service provider. It's in private preview next month and will be generally available for customer adoption next fiscal year. So, this year, we're not counting that in the materiality of our business.","We will give you more color in our next Analyst Day in spring. But I do think it will be an additional growth driver for the company. I think the way I look at it we are riding several long-term secular trends: data growth and the criticality of data in a digital business; major technological transitions like solid-state storage, converged infrastructure and the cloud. We have a differentiated strategy for customers, the Data Fabric strategy, which is very, very difficult for people to replicate. As you know, we've been working on this for five years.","We also have a vastly differentiated innovation portfolio with many years of differentiated software innovation that positions us to build the Data Fabric and deliver it in compelling products. And our execution has been really strong. So we feel we have a lot of headroom to continue to take the business, and we are going to double down on it. And we see strong momentum heading into the second half of the year.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about \u2013 you mentioned having adequate flash supply. Can you talk a little bit about what it's meant to the pricing of your products and the impacts on revenues and gross margins and how you see that evolving over the next year as the commodity comes more into supply\/demand parity? Thank you.","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","Yeah. We do have adequate supply for both SSDs and DRAM, by the way. Definitely more of a headwind on the DRAM pricing, that's definitely something everyone's suffering from right now, but moderated increases on SSDs. I think what we're seeing now is it's widely anticipated sometime in the first half of the next calendar year, we should see supply free up.","That slipped a little bit from what we thought before. It looked like beginning of next year it will start to free up, but now it's delayed a little bit. So, at this point, it hasn't really affected either our gross margins or our revenue, and I don't anticipate that it will in the future.","As we said in the past, typically, what we've done when we've gotten commodity price increases is pass them on to customers, those increases. And by the same token, when we see those commodities decrease, we pass along the price decrease as well.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you, Tim. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Ron, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the operating leverage to the gross profit line. By my numbers, it looks like you've pulled tremendous conversion margins down on the upside from sales. Can you just talk a little bit more detail what caused that? And then you did reference that that could continue to occur. What would be the forward-looking statement and why you get continued gross margin, conversion margins like you've been seeing? Thanks.","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","So, different than last year where we typically were under-spending on OpEx throughout the year. What we're seeing this year is we're overachieving on gross margin. I mentioned that was a focus area of the company. It's an area we've had a lot of effort and work put into. We were particularly focused on product margins and have made pretty good progress, I think we have a ways to go, so that's where that continued leverage would come from.","As well, I think what you're seeing is we're holding OpEx largely in line with what we told you. For the year, the only increase we had at beginning of the year was merit increases for employees. At this point, we have a little bit of headwind on OpEx just from FX and variable compensation. But essentially, you have gross margin growing at a higher rate than revenue on a dollar basis, and you have OpEx being held below both of those growth rates. So that's where you're getting the operating leverage.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Brian White of Drexel. Your line is open.","Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hi, George, I'm wondering if you could talk about what you saw in the federal market in the quarter and also the enterprise market at large. Cisco just had a call, enterprise product revenues are down 5% year-over-year. They highlighted delays at big customers. So maybe if you could tease that out for us. Thanks.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","We saw good momentum in the public sector market. The book of business, as you know, we have a broad-based book of business because we are the unquestioned market leader in the public sector market. It reflects the spending priorities of the administration. So, defense and intelligence were strong, reflecting the budget allocations that they received.","But we were \u2013 overall, we feel confident that we gained share. We saw the normal year-end budget flush across all of the different segments in public sector. Our enterprise book of business was also very good. It was very strong across all of the geographies. We saw strength in \u2013 particular strength in the Americas and in Asia Pacific, but good balanced book of business across the board.","Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Great. Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you, Brian. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. It's Jim Suva from Citi. I have a question and it has to do with \u2013 you'd mentioned ability to secure memory pricing, NAND and DRAM, I'm sure you're talking about, are secure memory. Were you talking about the availability to get it or have you locked down pricing? My understanding is it's probably being locked down supply and then as the fluctuations in price changes, you probably adjust that in your product portfolio, but maybe I'm wrong with that.","And then you mentioned something about a onetime gross margin benefit, like, what was that? Was it memory related and how much of it and how should we think about that going forward? Thank you.","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","Yeah, Jim. So it is in relation to locking down supply. We do start to agree on price as we get closer to the quarter, but not that far out. It's anything \u2013 six months out, we're not agreeing on price. It's just supply.","And then we just had some manufacturing variances in the quarter. Some were related to memory, but there were other purchase price variances we saw. That's it. You can't count on those necessarily reoccurring.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","But can you quantify those variances for this quarter?","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","On a total gross margin basis, it was roughly about a 0.5 point.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you and congratulations to you and your team on their execution.","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks. Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you, Jim. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Follow-up as it relates to gross margins. There were some pretty meaningful swings in the balance sheet, inventory down sequentially eight or nine days. And as you mentioned, days payable were up significantly year-on-year, which helped the cash conversion cycle. Just wondering if that relates to some of the actions you've taken to fight the memory pricing and if that had any benefit on gross margins that you see as sustainable? Or what else drove those swings on the balance sheet? Thanks.","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","Okay. So, Katy, I think what I tried to intimate last quarter is inventory was a little bit high. Some of that was due to SSDs. We knew we worked that down, we're doing that. We're back to the levels we were roughly on inventory days and turns where we were roughly eight year ago. So that's more like where we should be. I don't think you can equate any of that to gross margin directly, and so I think they're quite disparate.","The DPO is something we worked on and have been working on, actively part of the transformation efforts around working capital management. So, you should see that going forward to continue. The goal is to be roughly zero cash conversion cycle.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Katy. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Srini Nandury of Summit Gladstone (sic) [Summit Redstone]. Your line is open.","Srini Nandury - Summit Redstone Partners LLC","All right. Thank you for taking my question. George, at the Supercomputing Conference I'm currently attending, the rage seems to be all about NVMe over Fabrics. It looks like SAN is coming back and people we talk to note that network storage is coming back given that HCI is still being used in limited use cases and storage efficiency is not being realized. Can you comment about the return of SAN, please? Thank you.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","Yes. We have got NVMe over Fabrics deployed in our EF-Series, EF570 Series product. We have NVMe over InfiniBand in that product for ultra-low-latency use cases especially in financial trading applications or in real-time analysis or fraud detection types of applications. We have NVMe support in our FAS series of products, where the NVMe is used as a low-latency cash. And we see that this is exactly the trend that enables people to get the benefits of shared storage, efficiency, single point of management, consolidation of footprint while getting the benefits of low latency and host connectivity. And so we do see that over time, as NVMe becomes more mature, it will become a big enabler. It will be a good enabler to network storage like you mentioned.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you, Srini. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Kelleher of D. A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wonder, you talked about hyper-converged. I want to talk about converged products. FlexPod, you said, was up very strong, up 20% year-over-year. Your partnership with Cisco has always been strong. A couple of weeks ago, you announced a new product, NetApp plus Fujitsu plus Extreme Networks. How do you position that converged product against FlexPod and how do you see our partnership with Cisco evolving? Thanks.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","Cisco continues to be a really strong partner of NetApp. Our strength in flash combined with the capabilities of the UCS and intent-based networking from Cisco is driving meaningful growth in the FlexPod business. As you noticed, 20% in the converged infrastructure business is substantially ahead of any other full stack vendor in the market. And so we are gaining share from competitors of both of our companies.","Fujitsu and NetApp have had a long-standing relationship of more than 20 years of joint engineering, as well as we have gone to market together in many parts of Europe together. The NFLEX solution with a simple converged infrastructure solution that combines compute from Fujitsu with storage from NetApp and is targeted at the EMEA market.","It is for customers who are looking for a simple preconfigured factory-built solution, which is different than what we have with FlexPod, which is much more flexible and customizable. And it's targeting places where Fujitsu has built customer relationships and loyalty. So it expands our reach and it provides us with another opportunity to compete more broadly in parts of the world that we didn't address as successfully before.","Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thanks.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you, Mark. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. I guess, if I just look at the Jan quarter guide on revenues, it suggests at least at the midpoint the revenue growth should accelerate to almost 7% on a year-over-year basis. I'm wondering if you could maybe just unpack that and talk about, if I think about 7% growth in Jan, how much of that is FX driven versus organic for you guys. And from an organic basis, I think you mentioned HCI, but I'm curious what else is driving that acceleration in organic growth for you?","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","First of all, I think the 7% number is correct. As we mentioned before, we see, in the normal seasonality of the business, the revenue growth rate to accelerate through the second half of the year, and this is consistent despite the fact that we've had a strong first half and it reflects our continued momentum. It reflects the broad book of business that we're seeing, reflective of the mature solutions just posted a 23% year-on-year growth, growth; the strategic solutions just posted 23% year-on-year growth. We continue to see that broad portfolio continuing to see accelerate.","Mature is almost flat now year-on-year, just down 3%, so the headwind for mature is going to decline. We continue to see gains in SAN and we have hyper-converged. So we feel very good about our portfolio and our execution in the marketplace.","With regard to FX, I'll have Ron comment on that.","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","Amit, FX is actually a little bit of a headwind going into next quarter, a little less than 1 point, so it's not helping at all.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter, guys.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Amit. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Your line is open.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC","Thank you. And my congrats on a great quarter and great guidance as well. Relative to the midpoint of your guidance, I believe that implied that product revenue would be up about 8% year-over-year, whereas it was up 14% year-over-year. And it sounds like the driver of that outperformance was strategic driven. So, within strategic, how much of that do you think you believe we can attribute to the complete portfolio of hybrid cloud data management software capabilities that, at least in my opinion, NetApp is pretty uniquely presenting to end customers? And okay, I'll just leave it at that for now.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","I think, first of all, the 7% number was aggregate revenue, not product revenue. We're not going to break out the guide of product versus services. But the 7% number that you impute is aggregate revenue. So we see continued acceleration of our business through the second half of this year.","With regard to our portfolio of innovation, we are winning both on-premises deployments as well as net new customer logos because of our Data Fabric strategy. I think that is aligned with customers' spending priorities and it is the best investment protection argument that any vendor in the marketplace can offer customers, which is, you can start with us on the cloud and move your data on premises. You can start with us on premises and take your data with you seamlessly to wherever you want to go.","So, the overall value proposition that we've spent years developing is clearly resonating as customers deploy the hybrid cloud. In addition, our individual solutions that underpin the Data Fabric are also very strong. We've got a compelling offering for SAN. The converged infrastructure portfolio is really strong and expanding with both Fujitsu and the hyper-converged. And our portfolio of hybrid cloud solutions continues to expand with the hyperscalers. So we feel very good about our position in the market and we're going to double down on it.","Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you, Nehal. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.","All right. Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. Just had a follow-up question on your product gross margin; it continues to expand. It was up another 190 basis points this quarter. Do you feel like you can still get that into the mid-50s where it's been historically? And then how should we think about product gross margin going forward as it relates to your Q3 and annual guidance?","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","So, Andy, great question. I was \u2013 we talked about this at Analyst Day. This year that's not the target we're aiming for. When we have our Analyst Day next year we'll give guide \u2013 that very well could be part of the discussion.

Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, thank you. Just following up on the product gross margin; can you maybe comment on the competitive pricing environment? It seems like the competitive pricing environment is more moderate than it's been historically. Maybe some detail on what you're seeing. Thanks.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","It's always competitive, Sherri. I think every transaction is competitive. I think we have a differentiated software portfolio and a long-term strategy, as well as I do want to congratulate our field organization on sales discipline that allows us to apply pricing discipline selectively where we need it, right? But every transaction remains competitive.","We have a portfolio of both all-flash and hybrid flash solutions, and one of the things we have noticed is that some customers are choosing hybrid flash since the price increases in solid-state. And so our unique approach where we have a single software architecture that can span both gives us a differentiated competitive position as well. And so we've been using that to be disciplined in the marketplace.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you, Sherri. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street.

What's the current share count?","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","The diluted share count for the quarter was 275 million.","Eric Martinuzzi - Lake Street Capital Markets LLC","Right.

Your line is open.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes, thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to a couple of quarters ago when we were talking about the installed base and opportunities associated with it. I think you have characterized the installed base as offering you opportunity in the range of $12 billion to $15 billion and all-flash array currently accounts \u2013 or the upgrade is only limited to less than 10%. And in that context, my question is where are we in upgrading the installed base? And how should we think about contribution of HSI (47:11) in that upgrade, should we assume a much accelerated upgrade, or is this something to be determined?","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","First of all, thanks for your question. The percentage of our installed base that is on solid-state is just about 10% now. And so we have a long base of footprint to go upgrade. And as you know, with our Clustered operating system, the process to upgrade our installed base to solid-state is pretty seamless. You can move from disk to flash in a seamless mechanism. And so we have a good opportunity ahead of us as flash continues to become more and more affordable relative to disk.","With regard to hyper-converged, I think that that's an opportunity for net new customer acquisition, net new workload capture and primarily at the expense of direct-attached storage or alternate storage solution from our competitors, and so we do see hyper-converged being additive to our installed base.","We are seeing that today in the use cases for hyper-converged as opposed to converged system like FlexPod, they are different. So we think that that's adding an upside (48:34). We'll tell you more as we get more into the hyper-converged market.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Right. Thank you, Mehdi.

","At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will have a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kris Newton","Hello, and thank you for joining us on our Q3 fiscal year 2015 earnings call. With me today are CEO, Tom Georgens; and CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2015, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. ","Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections.","Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We described some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on a Form 8-K. Please refer to the documents we filed from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2014, subsequent Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our current reports on Form 8-K also on file with the SEC and available on our website.","During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release and on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom for his commentary on the quarter.","Tom Georgens","Thank you, Kris and good afternoon everyone. We are clearly disappointed with our top line performance in Q3 and are committed to taking the steps necessary to get back on track. ","Despite the soft revenue we delivered another quarter of solid operational performance with improved gross margins from Q3 a year ago, and non-GAAP operation margin at the high end of our prior guidance. ","We further reduced diluted share count and delivered EPS within our previous guidance range. We remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and continue to make progress against our hybrid class strategy. ","Top line revenue finished below the low end of our guidance, impacted by greater than anticipated FX movement in the quarter, which Nick will quantify shortly, as well as our own sales execution issues. ","EMEA and APAC were impacted by FX, U.S. public sector driven by strong performance in federal had the highest growth, but Americas Commercial fell sort of expectations. ","The Americas team bullied by the increase in enterprise large deal activity in the first half of the fiscal year was optimistic about their forecast. Deals over $1 million increased yet again in Q3, but we also saw a significant number of large deals slip out of the quarter. We have new leadership in global and Americas sales and I\u2019m confident in the team and fully expect execution to improve.","Looking ahead, we see FX headwinds impacting growth for not only NetApp but our customers as well. As companies lower their revenue expectations for the coming calendar year, there is an increase deferral of IT projects. We clearly saw that in January. ","Anticipated budget was no longer available as companies delivered updated spending targets for the new calendar year and deals that were pushed out may not return in the near term. We are seeing large tech refresh opportunities being replaced with one-year support renewals and indications that customers remain committed to NetApp, but do not have budget to upgrade at this time.","Despite the revenue short fall we continue to make progress in key areas. As I mentioned earlier, Q3 marked our third consecutive quarter of growth in large deals, a point of validation of our enterprise strategy. In November we further delivered against our data fabric vision with the availability of NetApp private stores for IBM software, the SteelStore appliance and Cloud ONTAP for Amazon web services. ","We also introduced the newest version of Data ONTAP the industry\u2019s number one storage operating system, Data ONTAP 8.3. To-date ONTAP 8.3 has had the fastest ramp of any of our Clustered ONTAP software release introductions. Shipments of Clustered nodes grew 160% from Q3 a year ago. The attached rate of Clustered ONTAP continues to increase and now stands at roughly 40% of FAS controller shift in the quarter. ","Total system units shipped increased 9% from Q3 last year. We saw notable strength in E-Series branded and configurations of all flash FAS. The entirety of our portfolio has been refreshed over the past year with the recent launch of the E560 and the EF560. We continue to see sustained momentum with our broad flash portfolio as flash capacity shipped grew 69% year-over-year. ","With FlashRay innovation injected into all flash FAS and the new EF560, we anticipate that our all FlashRay systems will soon hold two of the top spots in the industry performance benchmark.","OnCommand Insight also continues to perform well with the number of deals increasing from Q3 a year ago. Overall we are confident with our portfolio and pleased with the growth of our emerging products. ","As we have discussed in the past both the market and the enterprise IT are undergoing a major transition. Likewise NetApp has been undergoing a transition to position ourselves for the future as we talked about at our analyst day last June. ","The NetApp data fabric vision, our seemliest hybrid cloud strategy is up leveling the nature of the conversations we are having with customers. We have delivered an unprecedented portfolio expansion, including new offerings in flash, object and cloud integration. We further augmented our cloud integration with the SteelStore product line acquisition. ","We have also highlighted the internal productivity, efficiency and supply line initiatives that have resulted in gross margin and operating margin improvements despite a very challenging growth environment.","We have increased emphasis on our enterprise and cloud service provider customers while maintaining the momentum we have in midsize business. We are seeing progress with our go-to- market transformation, but it\u2019s still a work in process and in need of ongoing improvement and investment. ","The increase in the breadth of the portfolio and our compelling data fabric vision are yielding positive results, but its clear in order to fully realize the value of these new capabilities, we must expand our go-to-market capacity with greater account coverage, product specialist and partner enablement.","Clustered Data ONTAP currently meets the technical requirements of our largest and most demanding customers. We believe NetApp\u2019s engagement, helping them execute the transition to Clustered ONTAP over the next year will unlock differed Tech Refresh.","In prior years go-to-market capacity expansion in times of high confidence in the portfolio proved to be a growth driver, even in difficult environments. We believe we are in a similar situation today. ","We also understand the imperative to deliver shareholder value in a low growth environment and the resulting pressure on operating expenses. We will continue to employ the discipline of shifting resources away from lower yield activities, as well as driving productivity and efficiency through the organization to offset as much as possible the impact of high priority investments to expand capacity.","Overall the growth of the emerging products, the uptake of Clustered ONTAP and the resonance of our vision with customers, as well as our operational focus have been on a positive trajectory. All of this only compounds our disappointment with our performance last quarter. ","External factors such as FX with clear headwinds, but our focus is on our own issues and what it takes to get back on track. We do not see any change to our strategic priorities and we\u2019ll aggressively seek to maximize return on our product portfolio within the confines of our business model.","I will now turn the call over to Nick to provide details on Q3 and our guidance for Q4 before returning with summary comments. Nick.","Nick Noviello","Thanks Tom. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. NetApp delivered strong non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin in fiscal Q3, underscoring the resiliency of our business model. We delivered non-GAAP EPS within our previous guidance range. However, as Tom indicated the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, combined with our own sales execution challenges presented headwinds in Q3 and resulted in revenue below our expectations.","Net revenues of $1.55 billion were up about 1% sequentially, but down 4% year-over-year. FX headwinds reduced the year-over-year revenue comparison by about 1 and 1.5 points, only a point of which we had anticipated when we gave revenue guidance for Q3 90 days ago. Product revenue of $930 million was down 8% year-over-year.","The combination of software entitlements and maintenance and service revenues totaling $622 million was up 5% year-over-year. Branded revenue was 92% of net revenues for Q3 and at $1.43 billion was flat sequentially, but down 2% year-over-year due to a combination of unfavorable foreign exchange and execution challenges in our Americas commercial sale geography. Adjusted for FX branded revenue would have been about flat year-over-year.","OEM revenue which is transacted in U.S. dollars was $124 million in Q3, up 4% sequentially, but down 21% on the year-over-year basis as expected. Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs accounted for 81% of Q3 net revenues. Arrow and Avent contributed 22% and 16% of net revenues respectively. ","Non-GAAP gross margin of 64.6% was up just over 1 point from Q3 last year and just above our prior guidance range despite FX headwinds. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 57% was relatively flat year-over-year driven by unfavorable mix and FX, partially offset by continued supply chain executions. Sequentially non-GAAP product gross margin was down just over a point due to mix. ","Service gross margin of 64.5% was 3.7 points above Q3 of last year and 1.8 points above Q2 due to higher services revenues and lower spending. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 18.5% at the high end of our previous guidance range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 46% of revenue. Consistent with our expectations, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 16.5%.","Q3 weighted average diluted share count of 317 million shares was below our prior guidance, down 6 million shares sequentially and down 29 million shares or 8% from Q3 last year due to continued stock repurchase activity. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 was in line with our prior guidance range and reflects the net impact of year-over-year FX headwinds of $0.02.","Our balance sheet remains healthy. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and investments, 13% of which is onshore. The sequential decrease in onshore cash was predominately due to shares repurchased and dividends paid in the quarter. ","Inventory turns were at 19 and day sales outstanding were 39. Deferred revenue was $3.1 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year. Q3 cash from operations was $275 million and free cash flow was 16% of revenue impacted by an increase in day sales outstanding due to unfavorable linearity.","In Q3 we returned $251 million to shareholders, which included $200 million in share repurchases and $51 million in cash dividends. Consistent with the guidance we provided last May, we remain on track to complete the remaining $206 million of our current share repurchase program by the end of May 2015, a year ahead of our original schedule. ","Over the last few years we have evolved our capital structure and delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders, while continuing to invest in the business. Through dividends and share repurchases we have returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders since May 2013. We are well positioned to move ahead with the next phase of our capital allocation strategy. ","I am pleased to announce that we have increased the size of our share repurchase authorization by $2.5 billion. We intend to complete this additional $2.5 billion share repurchase program by the end of May 2018, with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016. Today we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.165 per share of the company\u2019s stock to be paid on April 23, 2015. We remain committed to increasing our dividend overtime. ","Enhancement to our capital allocation strategy reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of NetApp\u2019s business as well as our ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value. We have structured the capital allocation plan to ensure flexibility to support innovation and growth initiatives. The timing and amount of repurchased transactions under the program, as well as future dividends and dividend increases will depend on market conditions, business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements.","Now to guidance, we remain confident in our strategy and competitive position. However, based on our own sales execution issues and the continued challenging IT spending environment, we are building a degree of caution into our top line expectations. ","We also expect FX headwinds to continue and impact the year-over-year comparisons. As a result our target revenue range for Q4 is $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion, which at the mid-point implies 3% sequential growth and a 3% decline in revenue versus Q4 last year. Based on current rates we have embedded an FX headwind of $50 million into our Q4 revenue guidance. ","We expect our strong value proposition to continue to resonate with customers and we will have an ongoing focus on supply chain efficiencies. With that said, we expect non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5% in Q4, including about a point of FX headwinds.","We expect non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 17% to 17.5% reflecting about a point of FX headwinds, as well as investments in our go-to-market capacity. Based on our repurchases in Q3 we expect Q4 diluted share count of approximately 319 million shares down 5% versus last year. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4 to range from approximately $0.70 to $0.75 per share, which reflects about $0.05 of dilution from unfavorable foreign exchange versus last year.","Our full year fiscal 2015 revenue will be lower than anticipated due to currency headwinds and incremental caution entering Q4, which I reference earlier. EPS is expected to be flat from FY \u201914 due to FX headwinds, revenue softness and investments in the business, offset by gross margin improvement and share repurchases. ","In closing, our product portfolio is as strong as it\u2019s ever been and our discussions with customers continue to evolve to more strategic levels. Our capital allocations strategy continues to reflect confidence in our ability to generate significant free cash flow, which will enable us to invest both organically and inorganically in the business, as well as return significant capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. ","The investments we are making today position us to fully take advantage of the opportunity ahead and we expect to emerge from this transition with greater levels of growth and profitability. Through this evolution we remain committed to our business model and to delivering shareholder value. ","Now, I would like to turn the call back to Tom for summary comments. Tom.","Tom Georgens","Thanks Nick. We remain confident in our business, but continue to operate in a challenging environment. We face ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and FX headwinds. Our industry is in transition as enterprises manage their existing infrastructure to meet the current and growing demands of the business, while adopting new technologies and delivery options. Our solutions and technology vision are well suited to help customers meet both of these requirements.","Cloud will play a key role in creating value for enterprise customers and we want to accelerate their ability to realize that value. Enterprise will deploy a hybrid model with both cloud based and on premise resources in their IT environments. ","Our NetApp data fabric vision provides customers with the only consistent way to manage, secure and protect their data regardless of where they choose to store it. The NetApp data fabric weaves together disparate data elements of the hybrid cloud into a single integrated architecture, giving customers control and choice with the flexibility, elasticity and ubiquity of cloud resources.","Data ONTAP is the foundation of the NetApp data fabric. Clustered Data ONTAP delivers true software-defined functionality with a set of enterprise-wide data management capabilities independent of the underlying hardware. Clustered ONTAP enables customers to grow incrementally and non-disruptively with the flexibility of a wide range of deployment options; from converged and integrated systems to third-party arrays, as well as software only and cloud options.","We are confident in our ability to help customers take advantage of the evolving IT landscape. Our data fabric vision and portfolio of data management solutions offer differentiated approach that improves the economics and flexibility of customers existing infrastructure, while giving on path to a hybrid cloud future.","Our best of breed solutions are compelling for existing requirements and are integrated into a broader vision for the hybrid cloud that only NetApp can deliver. The investments we are making in our go-to-market capacity and then accelerating the migration to Clustered ONTAP demonstrate the strength of our conviction in our technology and our strategy. ","During this transition we remain committed to our business model and delivering shareholder value. Our expanded repurchase authorization exemplifies this commitment. We expect to come through the transition in a stronger position with a high level of growth and profitability.","Before moving to Q&A, I would like to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued commitment. Despite the challenging environment we are making the right choices and remain focused on innovation and execution, which enable us to deliver value to our customers and yield solid operational returns.","We will now open up the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can address as many people as possible. Thank you. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open please proceed with your question.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Hi, thanks. Nike I was trying to get a sense of how the FX split out between your different segments. Thank you for the detail on the impact this quarter; but was a lot of that in product or was it also in the software and services segment. It seemed like the product revenue was down a lot year-over-year? Thanks.","Nick Noviello","Yes, Sherri in terms of Q3 in terms of product revenue for Q3 it was all there, so its about two point on product revenue from the FX side of the fence. You have to remember that the SEM line and the services line are substantially coming in off the balance sheet. So the FX is really pointed at the product side of fence.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open please proceed with your question.","Maynard Um - Wells Fargo","A little bit about the execution issues. I guess to start, what gives you confidence that it is execution issues rather than competitive or secular and I guess what, can you go into the issues a little bit more in particular on how you do intent to fix that going forward? Thanks.","Tom Georgens","Well, I think from the question about whether it will be secular or competitive, and effectively what we are talking about here, what we saw pushed out were actually deals in the committed pipeline. ","So whether the question of we didn\u2019t have pipeline and we didn\u2019t have deals that we are pursuing, these are deals that the sales force had committed, that reflected in our forecast, reflected in our guidance and reflected in our planning as the quarter proceeded, and so not surprisingly Monday the quarter ended, I was ahead of Americas sales and went through, what happened to these deals? They went through a relatively long list of deals two pages worth of deals that were committed that we expect to count that didn\u2019t come in and all of them have a story of which competitive and loss deals was a trivially small amount of that. ","So from a competitive perspective I\u2019d say first and foremost the competitive wasn\u2019t the key components. Some of it clearly was closable deals that we didn\u2019t get done and that\u2019s entirely on us, some of it was changes in customer behavior with the change of the calendar year and companies looking at their own financial forecast, their own FX impact. We certainly saw the fall of deals that we thought were there.","The other thing is, in order for the deals to be in the committed pipeline there are deals for which substantially we have won the technical recommendation, so the competitive phase of a lot of these transactions was effectively over. So it\u2019s really about either customers changing budgets, requiring more scrutiny in their approval process or fundamentally thinking about their new budgets in line with the new calendar year. ","I think going forward clearly we need to watch this a lot more closely. We certainly saw elongated sale cycles earlier in the quarter, but the forecast has remained unchanged and the team is still relatively bullish about pulling it out. So I think that, we need to look at some of the data points along the way. Certainly we need to inspect a lot closer and you can argue that the other side of this and the message to the team is that there is uncertainty about closing deals, you need more deals, so what are we going to do to enhance the pipeline. ","So clearly we are going to be watching this closely as we look at our productivity, whether it be pipeline generation per rep and even despite the quarter in terms of actually bookings per rep, the numbers are actually quite high, relatively high in our history. So the sales force productivity is actually still pretty high, yet we didn\u2019t get these deals closed. But the feeling is it isn\u2019t like the sales force can\u2019t sell and productivity is down. That will be more of an indicator of a product problem or there is no opportunity out there.","So our feeling is as long as productivity is high that people are generating pipeline at peak levels historically, that if we could put more feet on the street and get more people out there selling the product, we can drive some more business. So that of course has a lead-time associated with in terms of hiring and bringing it up to speed. But at the end of the day we wouldn\u2019t have these deals in the committed pipeline, we wouldn\u2019t have the pipeline productivity we had unless we felt strongly about the portfolio and the portfolio was resonating. ","So I think where we are now, you know I don\u2019t think product is our issue. I think capacity is our issue and that\u2019s the bet we are making and that\u2019s what you are going to see from us going forward.","Maynard Um - Wells Fargo","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open please proceed with your question.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Hi Tom. I want to follow on Maynard\u2019s question. Clearly every enterprise company is suffering from FX and so let\u2019s remove that from the conversation, but we haven\u2019t heard many or very, very few companies talk about elongated sales cycles in the current macro with the recent string a companies that have reported, including Cisco tonight. ","So just wanted to try to understand what\u2019s your thoughts on why NetApp in particular seems to be seeing some issues on deferrals or pipeline not coming through. Is it something related to the storage side in particular, but just want to get some more thoughts about why you think NetApp in particular is seeing some of those elongated sales cycles.","Tom Georgens","Well, I think a few things. I think some of those I\u2019ll say; I don\u2019t think we quite know. I think we need more data. All we really understand is our own point of view here. So certainly we see the FX that\u2019s a purely mathematical exercise, we get that. ","Likewise we see FX not only in our industry but we also see FX impact on our customers and that\u2019s got to lead through into the decisions that they make. So I don\u2019t really know the answer to your question, until we see actually more companies that are reporting January quarters. So our assumption if FX is purely mathematically and everything else is our responsibility to get on to and fix. ","And like I said, if you look at these individual accounts, there is no doubt that we had closeable deals that we didn\u2019t get done in time and that\u2019s pure execution and those will fall into Q4, but we\u2019ve also seen elongated approval cycles and we\u2019ve also seen people re-evaluating what their plans are for the year now that the calendar year has changed. People thought they had budget when we put this in the pipeline, they don\u2019t now and I think the return on those transactions is as yet unknown. ","So I think from our perspective we just clearly need to do better on that. I\u2019m certainly not ready to say that there is a broader trend until I see some more data points, but for our point of view is that we are going to focus on our deals and our pipeline and we are going to do a better job executing this quarter.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Tom was everything on track the first two months and the wheels kind of came off the last months for the quarter?","Tom Georgens ","Well certainly the forecast hadn\u2019t deteriorated materially at the beginning, so we were. Obviously this is a quarter where you\u2019ve got kind of the end of the quarter push and you got the end of the calendar year push, which is a little bit different than other quarters. But from our point of view is certainly we saw bullishness going into the end of the year and then still we have expectation of a relatively strong normal quarter end in January, and a fair amount of that business didn\u2019t come through the way we would have thought. ","So I think we did see the budget flush. Maybe we can debate whether is this robust as we would have thought, but certainly close enough, but we certainly had a lot of January business that was a normal part of our final month of the quarter that we see being back end loaded that didn\u2019t come. And like I said, every deal has a story, but when you go through 40 deals and only one or two are competitive and the rest of them are deals specific, I don\u2019t think the competition is really the issue. And on top of that, the feedback from the field was optimistic the whole quarter. ","We still did a record number of million or increased number of million dollar deals. So it wasn\u2019t like they were searching for business. They have business that they have, that it was winding up and they thought they were going to close and they didn\u2019t. ","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Okay, I will cede the floor then, thank you.","Tom Georgens ","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open please proceed with your question. ","Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse","Thank you for the question. For Tom, with respect to the deferral of spending you're talking about, I guess this comes after a period of time where there's already been a prolonged period of deferral. ","So I guess at some point your customers in your installed base just need to spend to much data growth, and despite all the efficiencies out there, why isn't that helping your visibility at some point? I'm just kind of curious, we've had a period of kind of sluggish growth in storage in the industry frankly, not just with your numbers. And so I'm curious as to how you would think about that dynamic going through last year and then now having this added issue? ","And then the other clarification is despite this deferral of spending that you talk about, you're not really assuming any that goes back in the near term just to be clear, just to be conservative. Is that correct?","Tom Georgens ","Yes, I think certainly you don\u2019t and with the surprise that we had where committed deals didn\u2019t closed and that assumed they were all just going to come back that simply. ","I think clearly we need to derate some of the feedback that we get, and I think we need to embed some caution into this and likewise frankly I think we need to see what other companies are reporting at January close and see if this is common or not. ","So I think that there is just a natural sense of conservatism, both in terms of the forecast we receive and likewise. Our own judging of those forecasts as a result of this. I mean simply put, we came out of the last quarter relatively bullish. ","When I lay out the delay of the land we were pushing the cloud story, we came out of Insight with a lot of momentum, the feedback on the cloud and the hybrid cloud from customers and partners has been tremendous. We did a dramatic expansion of the portfolio with refreshes E-Series introduction of the storage with Webscale, we acquired the SteelSore product the release of 8.3. ","So very strong about the portfolio. I felt very strong about the forecast and I think we came out this last call actually relatively excited about where we are heading. So that\u2019s why we are really doubly disappointed about all of this. In the end if suddenly there was a competitive disjoint or some type of quality issue or some type of product issue, but there is really none of that. So things were pretty much normal as far as we look at the quarter as it played out until we got to the end.","Operator","Thank you our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Rod Hall - JP Morgan","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess I want to circle back around this January commentary and see if you guys could \u2013 those 40 deals, I guess Tom that you are talking about, is there any regional pattern that you spotted? I mean did you see particular regions worsening in January and others not? Did you see just sort of across the board in January things not coming through as you had expected? ","And then I also, just as a follow-up to that, wanted to see if you could comment. Do you think that, have you had any direct feedback from people suggesting that maybe budgets got reset and they come back to the table in January and they can't do the deal because there's some sort of a trend in terms of enterprise budgets? Thank. ","Tom Georgens","Yes, I mean the budget reset is exactly what I\u2019m saying. So I think that that\u2019s clearly the case. I think in terms of markets in general, certainly energy was one that kind of jumped out of people being very, very cautious obviously with the movement of the price of oil and I think certainly on the oil and gas it has a negative impact. Presumably it will help the rest of the industry, but I think that\u2019s a lot more diffused and I think it will take more time to flow through.","So I\u2019d say probably the only segment that I\u2019d say that we can clearly identify with relatively urge and caution would be oil and gas, but I\u2019d say mostly the rest of the business is spread around. I mean other sectors were very robust. I mean one of the things that we talked about in prior calls is our belief that we are going to see solid growth on the federal side, the second half of the year, over easier compares last year that entirely came through. ","So if I think about the road map that we went into this year, we communicated at analyst day, we talked about our rebound in federal in terms of growth in the second half of the year and we certainly saw that. We talked about focus on the enterprise and we certainly saw record $1 million deals, we certainly saw that. We saw certainly growth in $1 million deals and I think overall it seems like a number of those things were on track and that\u2019s what we kind of left last quarter with, in terms of how we felt about the second half of the year. ","So I think some of the things came together and but the other ones didn\u2019t. I think we sense that FX was clearly an issue that was certainly a comment that we had last quarter. I think that\u2019s proven to be a bigger issue than we originally thought and they quantify that and likewise it\u2019s not just an issue for us or our competitors, that\u2019s also an issue for our customers, which has impact on their buying.","Rod Hall - JP Morgan","Great. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Milunovich - UBS","Thank you. Tom, did you say that there was a change in sales management? Could you talk a bit more about it? If that's true, who is in place now? And you also talked about investments in go-to-markets. Could you talk a bit about what those investments are? And Nick, are we going to see kind of a pickup in the SG&A to revenue ratio in the fourth quarter? ","Tom Georgens ","Yes I don\u2019t think its any secret that certainly we hired a new Head of Global Sales and we also have new leadership in the Americas commercial business. I should point out that the leader of that business is the person who led our federal business to number one market share in the federal space. So it\u2019s a person that has very strong track record, somebody we have a lot of confidence in. ","So could it be some measure of them not being familiar with their guys and judging the forecast, I think certainly that\u2019s a factor, but I think in general these are people that were pleased with the work that Randy doing, certainly Mark\u2019s has a great history and so we are still confident in the team. So I wouldn\u2019t want to signal any of this message that there is a change in the team. ","Perhaps there is some change in process, perhaps that impacted the forecasting; I\u2019m guessing that that\u2019s a factor, but we are talking about two people who practice really deep inspection. Like I said on the Monday the quarter was over, I had a very, very detailed report on what happed in the quarter before in terms of deals that happened, deals that didn\u2019t happened, why they didn\u2019t happened and what we should expect going forward. ","Nick Noviello","Steve, its Nick. Let me just add to that comment or answer your question around SG&A revenue. When we look at operating expenses, what Tom mentioned in his comments, this is also going to be an environment where we are going to position our investments for highest return activity. So to the degree we are investing in certain areas and pushing investments in some, we are going to be holding investment in others and I think that\u2019s really important from the perspective of the business model and running the business go forward. ","So I don\u2019t see a material change in Q4 as an example of SG&A to revenue. Certainly and we\u2019ll give guidance in May for next year and we\u2019ll talk about Q1, we\u2019ll go a quarter at a time and give you a perspective a quarter at a time. Always a lot of times Q1 looks a little disjointed, why? Because top line there is a substantial sequential decline in top line from Q4 to Q1, so we\u2019ll go through all of that now. But to your specific question of Q4, I don\u2019t see a substantial or a material change in the SG&A or the operating expense to revenue ratios here. ","Steve Milunovich - UBS","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Yes, thank you. How do we reconcile the comments on the weak January and delayed deals with DSOs that were up 6 days at the end of the quarter? And then also does the limited recovery in branded growth after refreshing the product portfolio change you are thinking on acquisitions as it relates to just broadening out the product portfolio? Thanks. ","Tom Georgens","No I think the DSO is a function of the timing of shipments and invoicing more than anything else. While there are elongated sales cycles, we still were backend loaded even through we didn\u2019t take all this business at the end. ","But that said, I don\u2019t think there is really anything more to the DOS story. The other question about \u2013 oh! Acquisitions. I think acquisitions, I don\u2019t think this changes our opinion on acquisitions. I think we will continue to move ahead with tuck-in acquisitions that expand our portfolio. We did two this past quarter. The SteelStore one is the one that got more headlines and I think we will continue to do that and that should be the normal course of business. I wouldn\u2019t expect that to neither accelerate nor decline. ","I think on the question of larger deals, those tend to be very, very asynchronous and hard to predict. So I think from our point of view if I look at transactions that we\u2019ve done, E-Series branded had a very, very strong quarter, up 100% again. I look at OnCommand Insight, which is also an acquired technology. That also had a very, very good quarter. So I think the success of our acquired business has been very good. ","So from my point of view I think we\u2019ll continue to do tuck-in acquisitions. In terms of larger deals, we don\u2019t get to predict when they are going to be available, when they are going to come about. But certainly our recent track record has been pretty good and for the right transactions, the right price when that\u2019s executable, we\u2019ll certainly move ahead with that. But I wouldn\u2019t want to predict any rate or any either increased desire or decreased desire to pursue those. ","Nick Noviello","And maybe just a comment to really take that DSO comment Katy and take it up one level with overall cash. I mean I think that cash and cash conversion as a percentage of revenue in Q3 was perhaps a little bit lighter than we typically do. However we will have a strong quarter in front of us here as well. ","So when I look at the overall statistics and the overall expectations in terms of cash generation this year, I don\u2019t see any change there at all. And I see us landing right inside the types of metrics we\u2019ve talked about and modeled for the three-year period of time certainly, that we talked about in our last financial analyst day.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, just want to verify something, like was there any particular product lines at all that sort of saw more details slip-outs and I guess just regionally I\u2019m looking at the year-over-year rates in both Europe and Asia, they are both down a lot sequentially here on a year-over-year basis. But Asia has a tough compare. Was there any kind of regional differences in terms of the activity you are seeing. ","Tom Georgens","I would say, one thin to bear in mind with the year-over-year comparison of Asia and especially EMEA, you got the currency component of that. There is some currency component, you got the Canada, South American, and the U.S. number as well or the Americas number, but not that big. So I\u2019d say certainly the FX one. ","There is really two questions I think in play. One of them is the relative performance and the other one is deals that we actually had in the pipeline that we are expecting to close. So I think we are looking at both of those differently. ","Overall in terms of our international business, the EMEA team is dealing with FX, obviously the Russia situation, even the French situation late in the quarter were all factors and I think overall from a booking perspective they did quite well. So I\u2019m actually \u2013 well, the numbers don\u2019t show, but I\u2019m actually quite pleased with the EMEA team. ","Asia Pac is not a unified region. All the different geographies perform differently, but I think overall they did pretty well. We saw growth in China again. Certainly the China headlights haven\u2019t been great, but I think the team there continues to make progress and so I think the biggest surprise relative to where we thought we were going be is in the American and particularly the America is non-federal. ","James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies","Any particular product lines to follow up that under performed or had more slip outs I should say.","Tom Georgens","Not in terms of slip deals. I think that the category on slip deals is really a function of size rather than product.","James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Tom I guess this is a question for you. You talked a fair bit about I think adding more boots to the ground, adding more product specialists. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense, I mean how much headcount increase do you anticipate doing or what\u2019s the timeline to doing that? Is it one quarter or two or three quarters and what sort of payback do you expect in terms of \u2013 in my head I guess branded growth accelerating. Maybe just walk through you know what kind of headcount additions you want to do and how do you think that pans out on the other side in terms of branded growth?","Tom Georgens","Well, I think at this point we are not ready to quantify that. I think that\u2019s a model that we are working through on our own. But obviously it will be something that we think is going to move the needle and something that we want to move the needle this coming fiscal year. So its not that its going to move the needle in the immediate term. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to hire people and they are going to be all still coordinated in a very, very short period of time. There will be a sliding scale in terms of how they ultimately ramp up. ","So the real impact to that will probably be towards the middle or the end of next year, but the vessel will be front ended and as Nick indicated, as we think about our full year business model, its our full attention to operate within the bounds of the business model that we have previously communicated.","But if I look at it, it\u2019s independent of the individual issues of the end of last quarter. If I look at our ratios and I look at our investments, we\u2019ve done a substantial expansion of the portfolio. Within that portfolio has been carve outs for specialists to drive things like E-Series and OnCommand. I think that\u2019s paid off quite nicely for us. ","As we think about adding new products to the portfolio whether it be StorageGRID or SteelStore, we\u2019re going to have to do some of that. So I expect all of those investments to come in, while in the meantime we still need to be cultivating new accounts and new opportunities for Clustered ONTAP.","And the other one is I think that our partners are a key part of this. I think invested in the partners so they come up to speed on the new products, so they are pitching. Its accepting and successfully be self sufficient in pursuing these opportunities and likewise helping our customers with the migration to Clustered ONTAP as they are all go to market activities that I think have immediate impact or relatively near term impact on the business.","But the simple fact of the matter is if sales force productivity was the issue and they were not anywhere near quota and they were sub-optimal, because we didn\u2019t have competitive products and we didn\u2019t have competitive technology, then I think we make it an entirely different investment choice. But the feeling is that the portfolio is strong and we just don\u2019t have enough people out there promoting and selling it and serving customers and that\u2019s the investment that we want to make within the confines of the business model that we talked about.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Jim Suva - Citigroup","Hey, thanks very much. Its Jim Suva here from Citi. NetApp has been going through a little bit of shifting with its sales people you know over the past 12 to 24 months out of certain areas in the focus of other areas and then today on the conference call you mentioned a need to really get the kind of feet going and the right people at the right place, but you have the expense area to be within the relatively normal of what you expect. ","So can you help me explain what\u2019s different? Meaning, you\u2019ve kind of been shifting around a little bit in the past 12 to 24 months and you\u2019re saying your still looking around. So what\u2019s different and how should we think about what your truly doing different to adjust these needs, especially if the expenses are not going higher.","Tom Georgens","Well, I think that there is really two questions here. One of them is the shifting of the resources within an envelope and the other one is the total envelope. So I think clearly we\u2019ve been doing shifting of resources within the envelope. I think across the entire company we worked very hard at that and I think that manifests itself in terms of the engineering choice that we made and the products that we\u2019re bringing to market. We were able to do that by de-emphasizing other products and fast moving out of certain spaces. ","We have certainly seen it in terms of carving out part of the sales resource to focus on some of these newer products. I talked about E-Series and OnCommand and that has worked out well for us and I also talked \u2013 in fact we spoke at the Analyst Day around the enterprise strategy and getting our partners more self sufficient in the mid-sized business, so we can migrate some of our resources against the bigger opportunities in the enterprise and we\u2019ve seen that million dollar deals. ","So if we look at that data and that is more specialists around the new products generate sales. If we look at moving more resource towards the enterprise we\u2019d generate more million dollar deals. If we can continue to make our partner self sufficient and continue that and widen the total number of people engaged in that, I think we\u2019re hard pressed off to conclude that there is an opportunity for growth in that and that\u2019s the nob that we want to turn. ","So only Clustered ONTAP has been a big investment. 8.3 is a culminating release for that. We absolutely needed to get that done. We need to get customers migrated to it. We certainly have the finished investments that we\u2019re making and other key technologies around all-flash FAS and flash in general, but I think we are ready to shift that transition towards field going activities now that the product arsenal is ready.","Nick Noviello","And Jim, I guess I might just add in the context of it and operating expense envelop of just under $3 billion on an annual basis, we believe we have the opportunity to shift investment for highest return activities.","Jim Suva - Citigroup","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Srini Nandury with W.R. Hambrecht and Summit Research. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Srini Nandury - W.R. Hambrecht and Summit Research","All right, thank you for taking my call up. The question I have is that regarding your flash, FlashRay. I don\u2019t know whether you commented on FlashRay during the quarter. I must have missed my earlier part of the call. The question is that you have a single controller device and its limiting your adoption in the market. As you look at the FlashRay opportunity out there, what does it take NetApp to become a dominant FlashRay provider; perhaps second in the market at 20% to 25%. ","Tom Georgens","Well, you are just talking about one product in the portfolio. We actually have the EF product which is doing quite well, we\u2019ve got the FlashRay product and we also have the all-flash FAS and then we\u2019ve got the hybrid rays that also have flash. We certainly talked at the analyst day and our view of this is that flash is a compelling technology. Its got a compelling set of deployments and they are all different form factors. There is flash in the host, there is all-flash arrays, there is hybrid arrays and all those are going to be important.","The key component for us ultimately is not any of the individual products or any of the individual categories. Its about total flash under management which was up huge year-over-year. So from our perspective I think we\u2019re absolutely in the flash game. I think FlashRay has been a key driver of innovation for us. ","We\u2019ve seen not only FlashRay in its own incarnation, but FlashRay technology integrated and introduced in the form of all-flash FAS and in EF as well, but all-flash FAS clearly has a product that the team is familiar with. It actually had a very, very big growth quarter and overall I think that the idea of an all-flash FAS instead of a stand along point product, to actually be a node of a cluster that\u2019s compatible with all of our other data movers and all of our storage efficiency and all of our scale-on capability is a compelling value proposition.","So I think FlashRay is going to serve a segment of the market. We continue to invest it in some customers\u2019 hands and we\u2019re getting feedback around the key efficiency and performance and ease of use components, but that\u2019s not the totality of the flash portfolio. In fact the overall majority of our flash is in the other products and in fact the all-flash FAS, which was only introduced about a quarter and a half ago is actually the one that\u2019s actually ramping the hardest of all of those and we\u2019re actually pretty pleased with the use cases and what you\u2019ll see from that is in fact from a number of our products are compelling performance benchmarks that we\u2019re going to publish in the very, very near future. ","So I think from a performance perspective certainly all-flash FAS has a feature set far beyond any other flash array and compelling performance and compelling efficiency. I think you\u2019ll see a lot more of that product in the near future as well while we continue to evolve and develop FlashRay to serve the segments that its targeted at.","Srini Nandury - W.R. Hambrecht and Summit Research","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Hi, thanks. On the headcount your adding, I think your saying you need more product specialists. So what exactly are you referring to? Is it more resources for the ramping flash business or maybe the service provider business or certain market verticals. I think just a little bit more clarity would be helpful. Thanks.","Tom Georgens","Yes, I don\u2019t want to leave a misperception there. I think first and foremost we\u2019re adding people that are carrying numbers. Whose job it is to close business and bring business in. So product specialists, I talked about them in the category of the product specialists have been successful, but within the fixed size envelop they\u2019ve comes at the expense of generalists that are selling the standard product and pursuing new accounts and those types of things. I think we want to be able to do both of these at the same time. ","So I think we have invested in an overlay. I\u2019d say the increment from here will not be nearly as significant percentage wise. What we\u2019re really looking to do is getting more people out there, getting in front of new customers, new customer acquisitions and deeper into our largest biggest customers. ","So I say that, the reason why I brought the product specialty is within a fixed envelope the more product specialists you have, the less generalists you have and our new is that we need more generalists out there pushing the ONTAP based products pursuant to our enterprise strategy. We are proving that we can get big deals if we move in that direction and now we want to get more people out there cultivating new accounts, deeper in existing accounts and bringing in more big deals. ","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Helpful thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is now open please proceed with your question. ","Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group","Thank you. The large deals that have been pushed out in favor of extending service agreements, is there any correlation to cloud ONTAP having become generally available? Is this potentially creating any further evaluation? Do you expect this to become a material part of these large deals? And can you give any metrics around cloud ONTAP at this point in time as well?","Tom Georgens","Well, I don\u2019t think that cloud ONTAP is changing that. I don\u2019t think cloud ONTAP is the substitute necessarily for the types of systems that we are selling with Clustered ONTAP on-premise. I think cloud ONTAP is completion of a story, its an option for a tested development and backup and flexibility and DR, but I don\u2019t think its changing the dynamic of do I buy an on-premise system of do I buy that. ","Now there\u2019s actually been a fair amount of activity around cloud ONTAP. The numbers of hours is in the 40,000 range. So those are people kicking the tires playing with it, some people are actually using it in production. But really when I see cloud ONTAP it\u2019s a completion of our end-to-end seamless data management story with the cloud. So I can run cloud ONTAP on extreme, I can run on-premise, then our private storage which has actually seen a lot of acceleration, its actually one of my favorite use cases. But overall I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s really disrupting it.","I think the cloud ONTAP is basically at this point its symbolic, and emblematic of NetApp's end to end seamless cloud strategy and proving that its real. But I don\u2019t think its intercepting near term business, that\u2019s actually not a concern of mine. ","Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group","Okay. Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. ","Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital","Yes, thank you for taking the question. My questions are on gross margin. What is the implied FX hit sequentially to the gross margin versus the pricing hit and mix? And to that end, do you feel you got to get more price aggressive is sort of the premise of the question as well, and versus some of the upstart competition? Thanks.","Nick Noviello","Ben if your talking about Q4 gross margin guidance there is about a point of FX in there, so I think you need to consider that. I wouldn\u2019t suggest that in there is any additional pricing aggressiveness. I think that pricing has been, has really been at this rate for some time, right. So there is dynamics in pricing and from time to time we did deeply discount. ","There are all of those types of things that we manage as part of managing the business. So there is not an incremental built into out gross margin guidance. We also inside our structure, inside our cog structure drive a set of efficiencies. And frankly over the last several years has been driving an increasing set of efficiencies. So I think all of that levels out in the end and I think the think to remember is there is appoint of FX in that year over year impact of that FX in that Q4 guidance. ","Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital","What's the sequential impact of FX?","Nick Noviello","I can\u2019t have that off the top of my head here Ben. ","Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital","Okay, hey, thanks a lot. ","Operator","Thank you and our final question comes from the line of Mark Heller with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Mark Heller - D.A. Davidson & Co. ","All right. Most of my questions have been asked by now. But let me just ask about SteelStore. Where does that fit into your expectations going forward, particularly on the cost side, but also on the top line for the next few quarters? ","Tom Georgens","Yes, I think what SteelStore effectively is, is a backup appliance that\u2019s integrated with the cloud and clearly from our point of view and for those of you who had insight at certainly the analyst day we talked about the economics of the cloud and cloud being a resting place for very low utilization data like backup and archive. So it\u2019s a way to seamlessly extend traditional backup all the way to the cloud and its something that we felt very, very strongly about as an opportunity and that was really the motivation for pursuing SteelStore.","So I\u2019d say that post transaction I think a couple of things came out, one of which was \u2013 this is a product with a fair amount of visibility within Amazon and the Amazon relationship is developing quite nicely around cloud ONTAP around NetApp private storage and this one has become a third leg of the stool in that relationship. In fact they\u2019ve actually gave us some reference accounts to pursue with this. ","So I think at this point its not material to the number that Nick just gave. It will be certainly not 05. Its already been on zero. I think its ahead of our initial forecast, but certainly we\u2019re on the very, very front end of that curve. ","So I think so far so good, no regrets, but I think it\u2019s a little bit too early to tell. But the real goal there ultimately is how do we enable the next generation of back up that successfully integrates the cloud, but is compatible with all the back up methodologies that people currently deploy on premise.","Mark Heller - D.A. Davidson & Co. ","Okay. Thanks.","Tom Georgens","Okay. So first of all, thank you all for joining us today. As I think about the quarter that we just completed and I think about where we were last quarter, the evolution of the roadmap, we introduced more new technology in the last six months, whether it be a Clustered ONTAP, 8.3, the acquisition of SteelStore, StorageGRID, OnCommand, Insight, E-Series, FlashRay or Flash FAS and the momentum that we saw, both in terms of last quarter, the forecast for this quarter, I think we feel very, very good about the business. ","So as I talked in the prepared text, clearly disappointed with the set back that we had. Probably a little bit more than disappointed, probably I\u2019m downright angry, because I felt like we\u2019re in very, very good shape and we need to do better than that. So as I think when we go forward I think my belief in its as good a shape as we are with the portfolio is unshaken. The execution issues we will fix and we are going to make key investments within the bounds of our business model to fully exploit the full potential of this portfolio and drive growth for this company and that\u2019s our commitment.","So once again, thank you for your time and I\u2019ll see you all next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Kris Newton","Hello and thank you for joining us on our Q4 fiscal year 2017 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2018 and our expectations regarding future revenue growth, improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including the macroeconomic and IT spending environments and our ability to successfully innovate in the growth areas of the market, gain market share, expand our operating margin and continue our capital allocation strategy.","Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q, our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2016 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated.","I will now turn the call over to George.","George Kurian","Thanks, Kris and good afternoon everyone. The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to fiscal 2017 for NetApp. Our continued focus and disciplined execution yielded yet another quarter of solid results on the top and bottom lines. Revenue for the fourth quarter was at the high end of our guidance range with both operating margin and earnings per share above our guidance. We have returned the company to revenue growth with improved profitability and earnings. By innovating to redefine traditional markets, bring enterprise-grade technology to emerging areas of the market and meet the evolving needs of our growing customer base, we are creating new opportunities for NetApp, gaining market share and expanding our addressable market.","When I became CEO, I set 3 priorities for the business: pivot to the growth areas of the market; reduce the cost structure of the company; maintain a robust capital allocation program. This intense focus has helped us systematically improve our execution and drive efficiency through the business and ultimately meet or beat our goals. We have successfully delivered against each priority and have effectively completed the first phase of our transformation. I\u2019ll provide more detail on this first phase and then share some perspective on the focus areas for the next.","Consistent with the plan we\u2019ve laid out, the headwinds from mature solutions, add-on hardware, OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode are lessening. In Q4, product revenue from mature solutions declined 7% year-over-year. Going into FY \u201818, the transition from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP is largely behind us, and we have a renewed focus on hardware and software OEM opportunities. These both will further moderate the decline in mature solutions.","Strategic solutions, which position us to lead in the new era of IT, was 70% of net product revenue, up 24% year-over-year. By emphasizing our Data Fabric strategy and our flash-enabled cloud integrated strategic solution, we\u2019ve driven a re-acceleration of the business. Our success in pivoting to the growth areas of the market is evident not only in the shift of our product revenue to strategic solutions, but also in the mix of our systems business, the majority of which now comes from products in the high-growth all-flash array market. We are in the early innings of the movement to flash and have a significant growth opportunity ahead as we penetrate our installed base and displace competitors\u2019 installations with our all-flash solutions.","Clustered ONTAP allows customers to modernize their infrastructure by replacing stand-alone silos of storage and monolithic frame arrays with a scale-out, software-defined, shared storage platform, delivering seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk, public and private clouds. We have successfully migrated over 50% of the capacity and almost 50% of the FAS systems in our large installed base to clustered ONTAP. In Q4, clustered ONTAP was deployed on 95% of FAS systems shipped. And as I noted earlier, the transition from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP is now behind us.","NetApp leads the industry in the transition to flash with cloud-integrated solutions that provide unrivaled efficiency, speed, scale and data management. We strengthened our number two position in calendar year 2016 and our growth continues to outpace the market and competitors, both large and small. We have entered into an agreement to acquire Plexistor, a company with technology and expertise in ultra-low latency persistent memory. This differentiated intellectual property will help us further accelerate our leadership position and capture new application types and emerging workloads.","For customers looking to modernize existing data centers, All Flash FAS deployed as both FAS engineered systems and FlexPod converged infrastructure solutions is the clear choice. We have been very successful replacing legacy frame array solutions from our competitors in Tier 1 SAN deployments, accessing a new market for us by disrupting it with flash. In 2016, NetApp was the fastest-growing of the leading SAN suppliers, a clear indicator that we are moving outside of our traditional installed base and expanding our opportunity.","In Q4, our all-flash array business grew almost 140% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $1.7 billion, inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services. We are winning with flash and expanding our intellectual property in this market, positioning us for success in the multiyear transition from disk to flash. The all-flash FlexPod and our momentum in the channel helped to strengthen our #2 position in the converged infrastructure market and contributed to the 44% year-over-year growth of FlexPod revenue reported in IDC\u2019s quarterly converged systems tracker for calendar Q4 2016. We also recently acquired Immersive Partner Solutions, a cloud-based converged infrastructure monitoring and compliance company. We will integrate this intellectual property into our FlexPod solutions to help customers further simplify and automate life cycle management and enhance our leadership in the converged infrastructure market.","We are growing the SolidFire business at an accelerating pace through continued innovation and expanded reach. The FY \u201817 revenue performance with SolidFire was in line with the expectations we laid out at the time of acquisition, and SolidFire was significantly less dilutive to our overall operating results than we expected. On our last earnings call, we announced that we are further leveraging our SolidFire investment and expanding our growth potential by developing the next generation of hyper-converged infrastructure. Development is on track and we look forward to sharing more details later this quarter.","Enterprises, cloud service providers and partners choose NetApp, because we enable their hybrid cloud strategies through our Data Fabric architecture. The NetApp Data Fabric delivers consistent and integrated data management services and applications for data insight, access, control, protection and security, enabling customers to unleash the full power of their data. We displaced Dell\/EMC as a cloud service provider with our all-flash FlexPod solution for its SAP HANA implementation. The customer chose NetApp because of our value and industry leading functionality. We helped a leading wine producer and distributor, realize their hybrid cloud strategy with the all-flash NetApp private storage for cloud, ONTAP Cloud and OnCommand Insight to manage it all. Key requirements of this transaction were a cloud strategy and the ability to manage complex migrations. OnCommand Insight allows customers to look at disparate storage environments in their data center and increasingly in the hybrid cloud to make decisions about where they want to optimize resources. The strength and focus of OnCommand Insight allows us to displace legacy competitive solutions and it is now the leader in the storage and device management market.","Ron will go into the details about our cost reductions, but I am pleased to announce that we overachieved in our goal of delivering a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million in OpEx and cost of sales. More importantly, we have made good progress towards focusing the business, driving disciplined portfolio management and systematically generating more efficiencies while setting a high bar for execution. Our capital allocation program includes the balance of shareholder returns and investment in the business. In FY \u201817, we returned over $900 million to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Additionally, we made organic and inorganic investments to support the long-term growth of the business, like the development of our ACI solution and continued innovation in all-flash arrays and hybrid cloud solutions.","Having successfully completed the first phase of our transformation, we will now drive the second phase delivering sustained growth in the fast growing parts of the market while maintaining a focus on margins and productivity. Again, we will focus on three priorities; first, we will expand our total addressable market by growing our portfolio and the ways we deliver it, strengthening our leadership position in all-flash arrays and converged infrastructure markets, continuing to push into Tier 1 SAN opportunities, introducing our ACI solution as well as new cloud services and partnerships, reinvigorating our OEM program and addressing new buyers in new ways. Second, we will continue to make fundamental changes to drive productivity, enabling further investment in the business while continuing to expand our operating margins. And third, we will continue our robust capital allocation program, which includes the combination of shareholder returns and investment for the long-term growth of the business.","FY \u201817 was a pivotal year for NetApp. We started the year with bold commitments and we delivered against all of them. We did what many said could not be done; return the company to growth while simultaneously expanding operating margins. With each successful step in our transformation, my confidence in our ability to create new opportunities and execute against those opportunities grows. As an independent player of scale, our openness creates a unique opportunity to partner broadly for successful customer outcomes. The mix of our business is weighted more towards the fastest growing parts of the market than our traditional competitors and we have significantly greater technology differentiation, customer relationships and scale in those growth areas than the new players who are trying to address them. As we enter FY \u201818, we are building on a strong foundation and are without question, the best positioned and the best executing in the industry.","I will now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q4 and fiscal year 2017 financial performance and go-forward expectations. Ron?","Ron Pasek","Thanks George and good afternoon everyone. As a reminder, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today, unless otherwise noted. NetApp delivered a strong finish to fiscal 2017. Our results clearly demonstrate the substantial progress we are making toward transforming the business, driving sustained growth and addressing the rapidly changing market.","Before discussing our full year results and future expectations, I will provide detail on our performance in the fourth quarter. Q4 net revenues were at the high end of our guidance at $1.48 billion. As we anticipated, the growth of our strategic solutions more than offset the declines in our mature solutions and started driving net revenue growth in the second half of 2017. The year-over-year Q4 net revenue growth of more than 7% is clear evidence of this dynamic. Product revenue of $852 million grew over 12% year-over-year, led by flash and the continued strength of our strategic solutions. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues increased 1% year-over-year.","Gross margin of 62.5% was 1 point better than Q3 and above our guidance range. Product gross margin of 48.9% increased about 3 points sequentially and 2 points year-over-year, reflecting improved sales discipline, fewer promotions and lower reserves [ph]. Software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat sequentially and increased just over 1 point on a year-over-year basis. Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin decreased over 1 point sequentially, but increased over 2 points year-over-year, reflecting the benefits from our transformation initiatives.","Operating expenses of $619 million increased 7% sequentially, reflecting higher variable compensation due to the higher than expected revenue growth. Despite slightly higher operating expenses, our operating margin of 20.7% was above our guidance range. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.1%, an increase of 3.5 points sequentially, reflecting a higher mix of U.S. profits. We ended the quarter with 278 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. EPS of $0.86 exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.02 as a result of higher revenue and higher gross margin. Cash and balance sheet metrics remained healthy in the quarter.","Our cash conversion cycle improved 13 days year-over-year, reflecting 24 days of combined improvement in DSO and DPO from our transformation initiatives, partially offset by a 10-day increase in DIO. Additionally, cash flow from operations grew 6% year-over-year to $365 million. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue declined 1% year-over-year due to lower ASPs and to a lesser extent, execution issues within renewals. Free cash flow grew 5% year-over-year to $327 million. Inventory turns decreased by 9 turns on a year-over-year basis, reflecting increased flash inventory and timing.","To reiterate, we are confident that we have secured adequate NAND supply to meet anticipated demand for the remainder of this calendar year. We have a unique advantage through our deep business and technical partnerships with our NAND and SSD suppliers. We partnered to help them bring their new technologies to market faster and consequently maximize our continuity of supply. We repurchased $129 million of NetApp shares and paid $51 million in cash dividends during the quarter. Finally, we ended the year with approximately $4.9 billion in cash and short-term investments, with roughly 9% held by our domestic entities.","Now turning to our full year 2017 results, net revenues of $5.52 billion were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2016. Gross margin of 62.3% was relatively flat compared to the previous year and was within our guidance range. Operating margin of 17.2% improved almost 4 points versus fiscal 2016 and was above our guidance range of 15% to 17%. In fiscal 2017, we took important and in some cases, difficult steps that were necessary to lower our cost structure and improve the alignment of our resources to our strategy. We committed to reducing our cost structure across both cost of sales and OpEx, yielding a net annualized run rate savings of $130 million after investment in SolidFire and other growth areas of the business. I am pleased to report that we exceeded this commitment, achieving annualized net run rate savings of approximately $140 million despite the impact of higher variable compensation in Q4.","Our effective tax rate was 19.2% and 1.5 points above expectations, reflecting the higher mix of U.S. profits. EPS of $2.73 for the full year increased 28% from 2016. We continued to deliver on our capital allocation strategy through a combination of dividends and share repurchases in excess of $900 million. We returned over 110% of free cash flow to shareholders this year. Additionally, we have completed over $1.7 billion of a $2.5 billion repurchase program we announced in February of 2015. We remain firmly committed to delivering shareholder value and are on track to complete the remaining $800 million by the end of May 2018. Today, I am pleased to announce a 5% increase in our next cash dividend to $0.20 per share, which will be paid on July 26, 2017.","Now to guidance. I am confident that we are making the right investments to compete and win not only in the market segments where we are strong today, but also in the new high-growth areas of the market. We are making tough decisions in key investments to expand our TAM and drive strong financial performance over the long term. Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect moderated revenue growth to ramp throughout the year, consistent with our normal seasonal trends. We are forecasting a gross margin range of 62% to 63% and expect operating margin in the range of 18% to 20%. We are committed to delivering low double-digit EPS growth and expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 19% to 20%. Additionally, we expect to continue generating meaningful free cash flow in the range of 17% to 19% of revenues, enabling us to invest in growth as well as continue to return significant capital to our shareholders in fiscal 2018.","With that in mind, I would like to take a moment to remind you of seasonal trends relating to our operating margin. We typically build momentum through the fiscal year. As such, Q1 is generally our softest quarter for operating margin, reflecting seasonally lower Q1 revenue as well as seasonally higher operating expenses mainly from salary adjustments.","That said, now on to guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We are forecasting a revenue range of $1.24 billion to $1.39 billion. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 2%. We expect gross margins of approximately 62% to 63%. We are targeting Q1 operating margins of 13.5% to 14.5%, reflecting the seasonality I just discussed. We expect EPS to be between $0.49 and $0.57. This implies a 15% growth year-over-year at the midpoint, which is consistent with our typical Q1 contribution to full year EPS and consistent with the long-term model of low double-digit EPS growth that I shared with you at our recent Analyst Day.","In closing, I am very pleased with NetApp\u2019s performance in fiscal 2017. We have sharpened our focus, accelerated our innovation and are shifting the investments toward the fastest-growing parts of the market while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value through improved profitability and cash flow. The substantial progress we have made drives my confidence in NetApp\u2019s growth potential and future.","With that, I will hand it back to Kris to open the call for question-and-answer session. Kris?","Kris Newton","We\u2019ll now open the call for question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Andrew Nowinski","Alright, thanks for taking the question and great quarter again. So your product gross margin improved nicely again this quarter, and I think you mentioned fewer promotions. Can you just give us any color on the promotion that you are no longer using and then maybe even a color on how you are competing against Dell\/EMC as it relates to pricing? Thanks.","Ron Pasek","Sure. I think we hinted at this at our Analyst Day. There was a cDOT promotion we had run for quite some time, and we were very clear that it pretty much ran its course and it, in fact, did. That definitely helped. As well, I think there were a couple other things that contributed, including better sales execution and discipline, and we didn\u2019t have the charge we had in Q3 of \u201817 as well.","George Kurian","We have also introduced a new class of high-value products and ONTAP 9.1 software that continues to differentiate our portfolio. So, overall, strong new products differentiation there, continued sales force discipline and execution as well as removing the clustered ONTAP migration program now that the majority of the migrations are done. With regard to EMC, as we said, we have competitive programs in place and we see continued momentum from those competitive programs. In Q4, we accelerated the rate of EMC take-outs for 2 \u2013 1 a day, and we mentioned that it was once every few days at the Analyst Day. I think in Q4, we have accelerated that to once per day, representing the fact that we have got the best all-flash array portfolio in the market.","Andrew Nowinski","Great. Thanks a lot.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Andy. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian White with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open.","Brian White","Hi, yes. George, could you talk a little bit about the trends you are seeing in the U.S. public spending vertical for the quarter and maybe for orders moving forward? I know one of the big OEMs highlighted weakness in that vertical over the past week. Thank you.","George Kurian","We had a good quarter in public sector, representing both market share gains as well as execution by our field organizations. I would tell you that the outlook for public sector depends on the budget that the new administration passes. I think we have a broad book of business in the public sector market. So my sense is that it\u2019s too early to tell, but defense is probably strengthened and civilian is probably hampered a little bit by the \u2013 if the budget passes the way it\u2019s shaped. We have got a broad book of business, and we continue to demonstrate leadership and execution in that market.","Brian White","Great. Thanks.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Brian. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi, thanks. Ron, you mentioned that you expect revenue growth to moderate \u2013 I think you said moderate, moderating revenue growth through the year. Can you talk a little bit about what that means exactly? I think you are \u2013 the midpoint of your guidance is just 1.6% revenue growth. Is revenue going to accelerate as we go through the year? Or is it going to be kind of in the same levels? How are you thinking about that as we progress through the year? Thanks.","Ron Pasek","Yes, what I tried to say, Sherri, is coming off of Q4, where we grew 7%, down to Q1, where we are seeing a roughly 2% year-over-year growth. We do expect that to accelerate through the year.","Sherri Scribner","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Sherri. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Aaron Rakers","Yes thank you. At the Analyst Day, you talked a little bit about the penetration rate of your customer base that shifted to all-flash. I am curious if you could give us an update with regard to that and how we should think about that looking out over the next 12 months. Where do you think that possibly could go?","George Kurian","I think we are in the early innings of the transition to all-flash. I would tell you our total opportunity is not only within our installed base where all-flash systems are less than 10% of our large and growing installed base, but also in displacing competitor frame arrays and legacy storage environments. So we are in the early stages of a multiyear transition from disk to flash, and we feel very well positioned to capitalize on that market transition. We are the fastest-growing vendor in the all-flash array market. It\u2019s outpacing our competitors, large and small. I think if you look at our numbers, we are up 140% year-over-year as compared to others who are in the 30% range. And if you look quarter-on-quarter, we are up 24% as opposed to them down sequentially in the same range. So we feel very, very good about our portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Jayson Noland","Okay great. I wanted to ask on the revenue guidance. You mentioned accelerate through the year. Can you grow product revenue for FY \u201818?","Ron Pasek","Well, yes, coming off the quarter in Q4 where we did, yes, absolutely. That is the plan.","Jayson Noland","For the full year F \u201818 over F \u201817, no?","George Kurian","Absolutely.","Jayson Noland","Okay, thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Jayson. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Kulbinder Garcha","Thank you for the questions. I guess given where you are guiding, it looks like operating margin for the first quarter you have to exit the year probably at peak levels in the low-20s, I think is the other trajectory we should think about or is there more of a step-up sooner in the year? Thanks.","Ron Pasek","Well, Kulbinder, as you saw this year, we started out quite low as well and accelerated from 12% in Q1 of \u201817 to over 20% in Q4 of \u201817. So yes, that is the seasonality I was addressing in my prepared remarks, so absolutely.","Kris Newton","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Simona Jankowski","Hi. Thank you. Just a couple of follow-ups from that also, in terms of the out-performance in product gross margins in the quarter, is an element of that driven by increasing prices to pass-through some of the NAND cost increases. And then Ron, for the first quarter, you talked about the OpEx seasonality, is there a seasonality relative to gross margin you would point us to or a mix impact. And then finally, from a long-term perspective, what is the natural product gross margin that you think is realistic for you guys, can you get back to the low-50s range? Thank you.","Ron Pasek","Yes. So the first part of your question Simona, so yes, I think what we had indicated is that we did raise prices in many of our flash products as a result of NAND prices increasing to us. And so in many cases, we did pass that along. The only seasonality you will see in gross margin relates sometimes to Q2 on a product basis. We see year end public sector revenue and margin go up. Otherwise, it\u2019s not that cyclical. I would hesitate to give a long-term guide on product margin. It is certainly our intent and I mentioned this at the Analyst Day that we should be doing better than we are and that is part of our AOP, or annual operating plan, for FY \u201818.","Simona Jankowski","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks Simona. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Maynard Um","Hi. Thanks. Can you just talk about the change in your go-to-market that you talked about at your Analyst Day, how much have you done and any qualitative or quantitative thoughts you can share on what you are seeing. And then similarly, with the compensation structure changes, have you seen any disruptions or any kind of turnover in sales that have been outside the norm? Thanks.","George Kurian","I think first of all, the confidence in our employees, customers and reseller partners is exceptionally good. I think the turnaround has been seen positively by everybody and we are attracting the world\u2019s best talent to NetApp. I think in terms of the compensation plan, the coverage model and some of the things that we talked about at the Financial Analyst Day, we recently implemented that at the start of May, which is the plan for the new fiscal year, fiscal \u201818. And so we are going to play that out through the course of this year. I think we entered the year with a really strong capacity number in terms of quota bearing heads, which is what we had said that as part of transformation, we are going to redeploy investments from non-quota bearing roles to quota bearing roles and we feel really good. The momentum in the product portfolio demonstrated market share gains and the right amount of capacity to execute our game plan for this year. And as I mentioned, we intend to grow product revenue year-on-year this year, accelerating through the course of the year.","Maynard Um","Great. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Maynard. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open.","Alex Kurtz","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I apologize if you have already touched on this, but when you look at your all-flash growth, can you help us quantify how much of that\u2019s coming from the installed base refresh over maybe the last nine months or so and how much of that is net new customer growth?","George Kurian","We are gaining new customers, new workloads and existing customers. And the two of them are represented by the fact that we are based on public market data from IDC, for example, the fastest growing major SAN vendor, fiber channel storage vendor, which is a net new market for NetApp. We have converted a small percentage, as I mentioned less than 10% of our install base to all-flash arrays. So the majority of our growth is coming from outside our installed base.","Alex Kurtz","Okay, alright. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Alex. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good afternoon. I am just a little confused on the gross margin guidance, so you are talking about doing 62% to 63% in the first quarter and then also for the full year even though you are talking about accelerating sales growth, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes between Q1 and say the full year guidance? Thanks.","Ron Pasek","I mean so we generally see Q1 as fairly flat to Q4. We have a little higher mix of services revenues, which usually helps gross margin. However, we do have NAND costs still increasing, so that\u2019s a little bit of a headwind. As I mentioned at Analyst Day, I think that will start to dissipate later in the year and certainly into next year. We are maintaining a fairly conservative range for the year, where we are trying some new things with compensation in the sales force. And we want to see them take hold. We will see how that goes. I think it can only be upside.","Steven Fox","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Mark Kelleher","Great. Thanks for taking the question. You talked about reinvigorating your OEM program, can you maybe talk a little bit about what your plans are there?","George Kurian","I think it\u2019s too early to comment. I think we do see the opportunity to access new markets and new geographies using both software as well as hardware. So we have succeeded in some of the smart city projects that are going on in Asia Pacific \u2013 in the Asia Pacific region, using a new type of integrator that combines NetApp storage with other components of a broad based smart city solution. That\u2019s one example. We will communicate more through the course of the year as news becomes available. But in the broad context, the combination of software assets from NetApp, like ONTAP Select or SolidFire software as well as the opportunity to create new solutions through new pathways makes us believe that OEM is no longer a place which declines, but rather flattens out or starts to grow moderately.","Mark Kelleher","Okay. Thanks.","Kris Newton","Thanks Mark. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jim Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","James Kisner","That\u2019s James, not Jim, to make sure. So on the \u2013 just a quick clarification, my next sort of question, on \u2013 you mentioned, I think the excess and obviously the inventory helping product margin, I want to make sure that that was still up, helping non-GAAP product margin and maybe you could quantify how much that helped. And then just separately, on just the \u2013 congrats on the minus 7% better mature solutions declines, are there any particular pieces in that business that outperformed that really helped you with that, I guess, you said differently, what\u2019s the product line that did the best year-over-year that drove that result? Thanks.","Ron Pasek","So on the \u2013 I was really trying to point out is we had that as a headwind in Q3. It certainly wasn\u2019t there in Q4. The main pieces of benefit were of course better sales execution and the removal of the promo for cDOT.","George Kurian","I think with regard to the mature solutions, I think first of all, we had said that as \u2013 the three components of mature solutions were add-on storage, OEM and 7-Mode. And they are increasingly becoming a smaller part of our overall business. So the year-on-year declines in them are frankly, smaller than they would be. The preponderant majority of that business is OEM and add-on storage at this point. And therefore, those will not be, as I said subject to the same rate of declines. 7-Mode is now a much, much smaller percentage of our business. If you think about the shipments out of the factory, they are 95% clustered ONTAP. And so we think that mature overall, as we had said many times, will be a place of stability or modest \u2013 very modest decline going forward.","James Kisner","Thanks very much.","Kris Newton","Thank you, James. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","David Ryzhik","Hi. Thanks so much. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini. Your anticipation for accelerating product growth throughout the year, does that include new products such as hyper-converged ramping. And the second part of my question is regarding cDOT migration, what is the strategy with legacy 7-Mode installations given that you are kind of signaling that your \u2013 that it\u2019s behind us, what is the strategy, if any? Thanks.","Ron Pasek","So with respect to ramp of new products yes, in fact SolidFire continues to ramp in the year and some other new products that will come along.","George Kurian","So we feel good about the portfolio we have to-date that have \u2013 we have just finished a very strong quarter. We think that many of the solutions that we saw this quarter have expanded potential and we will continue to demonstrate additive innovations to the portfolio over the course of the year, stay tuned. With regard to the customer base and the partner channel on clustered ONTAP, we have migrated a substantial percentage of that customer base as we have communicated, 2 clustering from 7-Mode. We have also trained our partner channel and trained our customers to achieve those migrations themselves. So we have given them tools, methodologies and allowed them to shadow us as we help them do the migrations. The remainder of those migrations will happen at the pace that customers take on IT projects. They will be a part of the broader IT agenda of customers. And so we feel very good. We have got the big percentage of our installed base migrated. We have seen real success with both clustered ONTAP and all-flash clustered ONTAP, called All Flash FAS and we think that we have established a compelling value proposition for customers to migrate over the remainder of the installed base.","David Ryzhik","Great. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Srini Nandury with Summit Redstone. Your line is now open.","Srini Nandury","Alright. Thank you for taking my questions. Congratulations on a good quarter. You mentioned on the call that you are taking out EMC once a day. What products are you displacing? Are those primarily Dell products or EMC or both?","George Kurian","We are displacing the EMC products, primarily VMAXs and VNXs as we tear out old SAN environments and replace them with All Flash FAS. We are also looking forward to displacing old Isilon environments with ONTAP 9.2. So we...","Srini Nandury","Alright. Thank you, George.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Srini. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Katy Huberty","Thanks. Good afternoon. Ron, how should we think about operating expense trend for the full year fiscal \u201818 in light of R&D for adjacent markets and some of the go-to-market investments you talked about at the Analyst Day?","Ron Pasek","Yes. So what I mentioned at Analyst Day for the 3-year period, it would be roughly flat. I also mentioned we would see a slight bump in \u201818 as we will see given we need to give people raises. But other than that, it\u2019s really pretty much flat to what we would have expected. Just to clarify one additional thing, Katy, what we are clear was that we are just continuing to do transformation that we would be using that as a tool to disinvest and reinvest in the business so that the reinvestment is not all incremental.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Katy. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot, guys. I guess just a question on the component shortages. And maybe I missed this, but could you quantify what headwind did component shortages or price increases have for you in the April quarter and how do you think of that headwind in July? And if I understand the structure of your \u2013 securing the NAND supply dynamic properly, is it fair to think you have secured the supply, but pricing could still fluctuate and still could have a margin impact?","Ron Pasek","That\u2019s right. I was hinting at that last quarter. We do secure the supply for the remainder of the calendar year, but we only do pricing for the next 90 days in advance. So it was about 1 point headwind in the Q4 quarter. It was about 0.5 point as we enter Q1.","Kris Newton","Alright. Thanks, Amit. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Rod Hall","Yes, thanks for the question. I just wanted to check on the competitive dynamic, a couple of questions actually on this. One is Dell\/EMC significantly increased their channel program at the beginning of the year, especially focused on storage. So I wonder if you could comment on whether you have seen any impacts from that and just kind of how that\u2019s playing out in the market? And then I also wanted to talk a little about these price increases. Do you expect others to do the same? And what do you think the impact on market demand is going to be, your customers going to pause spending as we get toward the back end of this year as they think about NAND eventually clearing and pricing coming back down or do you think people will keep that ongoing? And then lastly, on NAND, I just want to ask that again. I mean, the data points in the quarter suggest that stabilization is not going to happen in the back end of this year as people have thought. Most \u2013 at least some of the suppliers are now pushing out supply\/demand breakeven into middle or even into next year. So I wonder if you are thinking that things are going to stabilize at the end of the year. Maybe it\u2019s a little bit optimistic. I would just like to get your comments on that.","George Kurian","Okay, that\u2019s a lot of questions, but let me take them in sequence. With regard to EMC channel programs, we have a strong group of channel partners that do a lot of business with NetApp that are focused on NetApp. I think the success of our All Flash FAS products, the success of our competitive programs, the success of FlexPod in an all-flash configuration are all indications of the strength of our channels and the focus that we have. I think EMC may sweep up some of the marginal partners, but they are not the core focus of our channel program. The second is with regard to the pricing dynamics in customers, we are uniquely positioned with clustered ONTAP to enable customers to move workloads between an all-flash configuration and a hybrid flash configuration that combines flash with disk seamlessly. So, we are able to provide customers a choice of both. We did see strength in our hybrid flash platforms this quarter as well, but it\u2019s too early to tell whether that was a reflection of pricing. It would be remiss of me to speculate on what other people would do. I think we felt that it was important for us to stay consistent to prior practice and future practice that we pass through to customers the increases in component costs as well as the decreases in component cost as they happen.","Ron Pasek","And then with respect to NAND supply, remember, we have strategic relationships with suppliers that allow us and afford us different dynamics than perhaps other people in the marketplace. So what I said today and previously are still consistent. So, we see our supply being in good shape and should free up later in the year and into next year.","Rod Hall","Okay, thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Rod. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is now open.","Nehal Chokshi","Thank you. The driver on the pullback of the year-over-year growth for the July quarter, I mean, you had 7% year-over-year growth for the April quarter and you are guiding at a midpoint of 2%. Is there a story behind why you are guiding for that pullback on that growth? And I do have a follow-up as well.","Ron Pasek","Nothing other than what we indicated at the Analyst Day. So, we really are giving realistic and in some cases conservative estimates and we want to make sure we meet or beat every commitment we made, as we have the last four quarters.","Nehal Chokshi","Okay. Is it possible that the year ago comps is a lot easier than it was for the April quarter and that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s going into that conservatism as well?","Ron Pasek","Actually, the year ago Q1 \u2013 Q1 of \u201817 was actually a pretty good quarter. It really was flat for product revenue. It was down slightly on services only, because we had a 13-week quarter versus 14 the year before. So, if anything, it\u2019s a more difficult compare.","Nehal Chokshi","That\u2019s what I meant, okay, sorry. And then my follow-up is that it looks like revenue from direct pathways took a step back in terms of the year-over-year growth profile while indirect accelerated. So, is there a story behind what seems to be two different tales for these two different pathways for market?","George Kurian","No, nothing substantive there. I think it\u2019s just mix and transactions, timing of transactions. I don\u2019t think there is anything systematic. I think we have had a good progress with our channel partners and we have seen strength in terms of total product revenue growth across both. FlexPod, in particular, we had a really strong year and second half of the year in particular with FlexPod through the FlexPod Advantage and All Flash FAS programs. So I would say that it probably reflects more the strength of the indirect channel through that model.","Nehal Chokshi","Okay, thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Nehal. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Simon Leopold","Great, thank you. First, I just wanted to clarify within the guidance, I think it seems to imply your operating expenses rise sequentially. And just looking at prior years, sales and marketing sometimes moves up, sometimes moves down on what is typically a seasonally lower revenue quarter. Could you help us understand any of the moving parts that might be influencing OpEx in your July guidance? And then in terms of the broader question, I wanted to ask about the longer term strategy in terms of all flash because you\u2019ve got hyper-converged product coming to market in three different all flash platforms. Is there some thought about trying to consolidate those platforms or looking for more synergies or are there synergies there and just not well appreciated? Thank you.","Ron Pasek","Yes. So on the walk on OpEx from Q4 to Q1, it\u2019s simply the fact that we are giving people raises. We are down in Q1 \u201818 versus Q1 a year ago. And again, we are doing some disinvestments and reinvestments. So that is the really simple explanation. That\u2019s it.","George Kurian","With regard to your second question, I would say we had very clear swim lanes and use cases that we described for our all-flash array platforms. And that allows customers to make ongoing purchase decisions with confidence in these roadmaps. With regard to offerings of both ONTAP and SolidFire, I would just tell you we have had a tradition of making ONTAP and SolidFire available as standalone systems as part of converged infrastructure, software and as a service model. And what you will see with SolidFire is its offering in a hyper-converged form factor. So it\u2019s consistent with practice. Our customers like the fact that they can operate a storage environment across all of these use cases. It gives them a huge return on both training as well as automation and management and monitoring infrastructure, unlike our competitors who have a different operating system for every single use case.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.","Kris Newton","Thanks Simon. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mark Moskowitz","Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just want to build off of Rod\u2019s question from earlier regarding competitive dynamics, it seems like it could be more than just Dell EMC if we are not mistaken in terms of Pure Storage starting to gain momentum of FlashBlade and also HP Enterprise acquiring Nimble, it just seems like NetApp now is in the crosshairs of a lot of different targets, you are a bull\u2019s eye of some of these other players out there, is this part of the reason why you are being a little more cautious on the guide and not really providing a full year revenue outlook, because you could have a lot more vectors hurting you?","George Kurian","Not at all, I think we feel real confident, right. If you look at the strategic portfolio, it accelerated through the year both in terms of its size as a percentage of our business as well as growth rates. Just take a look, last quarter, it was up 22% on product revenue; strategic product revenue this quarter, 24%. Last year, it was 14% at this time. So we feel real good about the product portfolio. I think it\u2019s \u2013 there is two things, right. I think one is we want to make sure that when we give you guidance, we can achieve those estimates and it\u2019s really that. And then the second is we continue to watch the macro. And as we get more color through the course of the year, we will certainly give you a better outlook as it becomes available. But it has got nothing to do with competitive dynamics. If you look at our market share numbers in all-flash arrays, we are outpacing all these guys. I would tell you that some of the competitor moves are desperation moves to catch us rather than us feeling worried about them.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Mark. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Your line is now open.","Eric Martinuzzi","Yes. I may have missed this earlier, but what was the headcount \u2013 what did you finish the headcount with for FY \u201817 and what\u2019s your expectation for headcount for FY \u2013 sorry, finish for FY \u201817 and your expectation for FY \u201818?","Ron Pasek","So we do not plan to add any net new headcount in FY \u201818. We finished the year at 10,103 employees.","Eric Martinuzzi","Got it. Thanks.","Kris Newton","Thanks Eric. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP. Your line is now open.","Erik Suppiger","Yes. Can you just expand on the Plexistor acquisition, how big was that?","George Kurian","It\u2019s a small number of employees. It is factored into the operating margin guidance that we gave you. So it will not be dilutive to operating margins. And at this point, we are not disclosing the terms of the transaction.","Erik Suppiger","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks Erik. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. Maybe I am doing my math wrong or something, but can you help me out, is your EPS guidance range bigger now than it has been historically in the past and if my math is correct, can you help us understand why bigger range?","Ron Pasek","Yes. What we did last year was had a bigger range to revenue, but it wasn\u2019t mirrored in EPS. So all I did was make them equal, so that it\u2019s more in line with the broader range we had established for revenue.","Jim Suva","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from John Lucia with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","John Lucia","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify on the revenue growth acceleration throughout FY \u201818, is that total revenue, product revenue or both?","Ron Pasek","Both.","John Lucia","Okay. And just to be clear again, you are expecting acceleration every single quarter so that Q4 has the highest growth rate, correct?","Ron Pasek","That would be our \u2013 well, not necessarily growth rate, but it would have our highest \u2013 it would be our highest revenue quarter for the year and that would be our traditional seasonal pattern, yes.","John Lucia","Okay. And then with respect to the NAND supply, you said that NetApp is well positioned because you have the ability to sell the hybrid and bring the price down given the HCD components, are customers really adjusting their purchasing decisions, because of a slightly \u2013 a slight price increase, it seems like if a customer settles on an all-flash solution, it\u2019s kind of a long-term strategic decision that wouldn\u2019t be influenced or changed to go to a hybrid solution by short-term pricing increases, so if you could elaborate on that, that would be helpful?","George Kurian","Yes. Flash still has \u2013 even with an increase in the cost of an SSD on $1 per gigabyte basis, flash still has compelling advantages from a total cost of ownership, right, density, power consumption, operational benefits. So there is a lot of other reasons why people would continue to choose flash. I think what we find is, we continued to have this benefit that when we position our solution to customers, they can buy into an architecture that ensures them against material moves in the price, right. Unlike our competitors who only have an all-flash storage system, we can go ahead and tell a customer, buy our clustered ONTAP architecture. And you know what, if the price of flash goes up substantially for a period of time, you can deployed a disk-based solution or a hybrid solution for those discretionary workloads that absolutely do not need an all-flash environment, right. And that\u2019s really how we position it. Flash continues to have material advantages over disk from a total cost of ownership perspective. That needs to be factored into the calculations.","John Lucia","Okay. Thank you very much.","Kris Newton","Thanks John. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thanks. Ron, sorry if I missed this, but can you just comment on the OpEx seasonality through the course of the year? Thanks.","Ron Pasek","Yes. I mean as I said, we see a little bump up in Q1 simply because we are giving people raises. Absent that, what you tend to see is it follow essentially variable comp, which would be higher in the second half of the year and that\u2019s really about it. Again, we are in a net zero headcount growth environment, so you shouldn\u2019t see any growth in headcount causing any cyclicality in OpEx.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay. Thanks.","Kris Newton","Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Wamsi. I will turn it back to George for closing comments.","George Kurian","Thanks Kris. We successfully completed the first phase of our transformation. We delivered against all our commitments for fiscal year \u201817 and returned the company to growth with expanded earnings growth. We are well positioned for sustained growth going forward. The majority of our systems business is in the high growth all-flash array market and the market is in the early days of the shift from disk to flash. Our compelling hyper-converged infrastructure solution will leapfrog the first generation HCI products by bringing HCI to the enterprise with cloud integration and the ability to run multiple workloads on a shared infrastructure. And we continue to expand our opportunity through organic and inorganic innovation. Entering the next phase of our transformation, we will focus on three priorities; expanding our opportunity with continued emphasis on the growth areas of the market, the way we deliver our solutions and reaching new buyers, making fundamental changes to enable reinvestment in the business while continuing to drive the expansion of our operating margins, as we have demonstrated this year and continuing our robust and balanced capital allocation program.","Thank you to all our partners and shareholders for supporting us during this period of transition.

Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.","At this time, I would like to hand the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Kris Newton - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hello, and thank you for joining us on our Q4 fiscal year 2015 earnings call. With me today are CEO, Tom Georgens; and CFO, Nick Noviello.","This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects such as our guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2016, our expectations regarding areas for investment, expectations regarding market acceptance of clustered Data ONTAP, our ability to drive growth and operational and financial performance, our expectations for our evolving business transition and our expectations regarding our business model and FY 2016, all of which involve risk and uncertainty.","Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We describe some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on a Form 8-K. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2014, subsequent Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website.","During the call we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release and on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom for his commentary on the quarter.","Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kris, and thank you all for joining us. We are not pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, and on today's call, I will outline the key reasons for our disappointing performance as well as the steps we are taking to position NetApp for the next phase of our evolution. I will then turn the call over to Nick to provide additional detail on the quarter and our expectations going into fiscal year 2016. Before we open the call for questions, I will return to summarize the reasons for our continued confidence in the business.","As I've discussed on past calls, the IT industry is undergoing a radical shift as customers rebalance their IT investments to take advantage of the cloud. IT organizations will deploy a mix of on-premises and cloud-based resources, which has slowed the growth rate of the storage market.","Every IT vendor is faced with this transition and the successful ones will involve their business to incorporate this new reality. We are well positioned for the era of cloud computing and with a robust portfolio of hybrid cloud solutions that enable customers to meet the current and growing demands of their business, while adopting new technologies and delivery options.","NetApp itself is also undergoing a significant transition with the conversion of our customers to clustered Data ONTAP. On our last call, we talked about the execution challenges in our Americas commercial business that materialized late in the third quarter. We also discussed the need to increase our go-to-market capacity. After a thorough analysis of these challenges, it is clear that we underestimated the disruption that the transition to clustered ONTAP has had on our direct and indirect pipeline.","The disruption has been most acutely felt in our Americas commercial geography due to the heavy concentration of large enterprise customers in the U.S. Clustered ONTAP is a re-architected and modernized version of the ONTAP technology. It is our platform for the next decade of innovation. However, to fully realize the benefits of this technology, customers have to update existing storage management processes and migrate their data.","While the value of clustered ONTAP is driving momentum with new customers and new workloads in existing customers, many of our largest installed base customers have been resistant to upgrades until feature parity with the traditional version of ONTAP was achieved. This is even true in cases where customers have standardized on clustered ONTAP for new workloads elsewhere in their environment.","The inhibitors to upgrade have now been mitigated with the generally available release of clustered ONTAP 8.3. Our largest customers now see a path to the advanced innovation and functionality of clustered ONTAP and are planning for migration. Since most of the upgrades occur in conjunction with hardware refreshes, we have seen delays in new hardware purchases until planning for process changes and downtime windows can be completed.","This planning can be complex and as a consequence, customers are deferring hardware refreshes and extending the life of existing gear. The financial impact to us is lower product sales and increased short-term service renewals. The complexity and duration of clustered ONTAP transitions have implications on several dimensions. First, it reduces predictability in some of our largest accounts. We saw that in Q3 and it continued in Q4.","Second, our smaller accounts, which are often partner led, are similarly facing this transition. While the installations tend to be less complex, we are often dependent upon our channel partners to guide them through the process. Those partners that have made an investment in clustered ONTAP training, typically our largest, have had a good year. However, others who are not as well versed in selling clustered ONTAP have seen their customers defer upgrades, which has negatively impacted our channel business.","And third, the effort to drive this conversion has adversely impacted our ability to acquire new footprints and new customers.","The net impact of these dynamics has resulted in an insufficient pipeline to meet our bookings objectives. To drive pipeline expansion we are taking concrete actions. First and foremost, we must accelerate the adoption of clustered ONTAP within our installed base now that the feature inhibitors have been removed. This requires an investment in training and migration services.","The objective is to unlock the tech refreshes that are waiting for clustered ONTAP upgrades. Some of these upgrades at our largest installations are complex and will be driven through direct engagement. But others are far simpler and can be facilitated by our channel partners. Therefore, our second action is to invest in the training and assistance necessary to build the confidence and competence in our broad partner base.","And finally, to offset the diversion of field focus in addressing these issues, we need to be actively engaged in acquiring new customers and new footprints through both direct and indirect channels and we will continue to invest in our sales capacity to create additional bandwidth.","Overall, we remain confident in the value proposition of clustered ONTAP and our customers' commitment to the transition. Certainly, we see some customer consideration of alternative cloud-based models, but we do not see as much risk from on-premise alternatives. It is unlikely that customers will adopt competitive technologies that have fewer features and require even more complex migrations when compared to clustered ONTAP. Therefore, we are confident that our investment in accelerating clustered ONTAP migrations will unlock business. Likewise, the need to broaden our reach to address more customers through sales capacity expansion, both direct and indirect, is an investment that we expect to yield positive results.","While our once-in-a-generation re-architecting of ONTAP has created a complexity for our sales channels that we are addressing, the rest of the portfolio has shown excellent progress. Looking ahead to the next generation of IT, we see the cloud as the biggest transitional force in the industry and for many use cases, it provides flexibility, economics and functionality that cannot be achieved with on-premises solutions. We are focused on accelerating enterprise ability to realize the full potential of the cloud, while recognizing that they will deploy a hybrid model with both cloud-based and on-premises resources in their IT environments.","Our strategy for the hybrid cloud and our portfolio of solutions provides customers with the only consistent way to manage, secure, and protect their data regardless of where they choose to store it. NetApp hybrid cloud solutions weave together disparate data elements into a single integrated architecture, giving customers control and choice with the flexibility, elasticity and ubiquity of cloud resources. The customer feedback on our hybrid cloud strategy has been outstanding. It's viewed as relevant, compelling, differentiated and real. Even for customers who are not ready to go mainstream on the cloud components, the completeness of our story and the enablement of their future direction are proving to be reasons to buy NetApp solutions today.","NetApp private storage for cloud gives customers the flexibility and economic benefits of a multi-cloud solution without the risk and regulatory concerns associated with relinquishing data stewardship or the threat of cloud vendor lock-in. During the fourth quarter, we further augmented our cloud solutions with new models of SteelStore as an Amazon machine image, giving customers an efficient and secure approach to backing up cloud-based workloads. Additionally, for customers who want a scalable, durable object storage solution for long-term archives, we have delivered on a major new release of StorageGRID Webscale which adds support for industry-leading storage efficiency, support for Amazon S3 as an integrated object storage tier and introduced the StorageGRID 5660 appliance.","We also released updates to OnCommand Cloud Manager and Cloud ONTAP, giving customers new capabilities to speed business innovation and IT responsiveness. We offer enterprises a choice of cloud providers and the ability to select based on cost, performance and service levels. Our cloud solutions demonstrate our commitment to enable customers to fully realize the flexibility and economics of hyperscale clouds and to do so as a seamless extension of their on-premise environment.","Other new elements of our portfolio have shown excellent progress this past year. Almost half of our enterprise customers are buying multiple solutions from our portfolio, proving that we are much broader than just ONTAP. Unit shipments of branded E-Series, inclusive of the all-flash EF family grew by 45% from Q4 a year ago and more than doubled in fiscal year 2015. E-Series augments our storage offerings with a high-performance SAN array for environments that do not require the level of data management provided by clustered ONTAP.","Additionally, OnCommand Insight, in use at the largest companies in the world, continues to exhibit strong growth with orders in the fourth quarter nearly doubling from a year ago. OnCommand Insight allows IT organizations to monitor their heterogeneous storage infrastructure and optimize asset utilization, which is critical as they manage through constrained spending environments. Much of the acceleration of the growth of these products in fiscal year 2015 resulted from bringing product specialists into a single organization focused on bringing new products to market. We recently added our hybrid cloud products to this organization, and it will continue to be one of the areas of increased investment.","We are excited by the increasing thought leadership of our cloud offerings and the sales momentum of the newer products, but it has been more than offset by the slowdown in the aggregate ONTAP business. New investments in traditional ONTAP deployments have been declining with unit shipments down 30% in fiscal year 2015. But the story of those customers who have made the transition to clustered ONTAP is a cause for optimism.","Clustered ONTAP delivers a software-defined, flash-optimized, cloud-enabled operating environment with a set of enterprise-wide data management capabilities independent of the underlying hardware. Customers can grow incrementally and non-disruptively with the flexibility of a wide range of deployment options from conversion-integrated systems to third-party arrays as well as software-only and cloud options.","We see a growing number of clustered ONTAP customers up 135% in fiscal year 2015 from the prior year. The bulk of this growth came from new to NetApp customers, which were up roughly 250% in fiscal year 2015. The number of repeat clustered ONTAP customers was also robust, growing more than 140% in the year. Additionally, shipments of clustered nodes grew 138% from Q4 a year ago and for the full year, they grew 163%.","The attach rate of clustered ONTAP continues to increase with roughly 50% of FAS controllers shipped in the fourth quarter going into clustered environments. Once transition to clustered ONTAP we see customer growth above current industry growth rates. Clustered ONTAP is also a vehicle for our leadership in key emerging segments of the storage industry.","In converged infrastructure, FlexPod had another good year with unit shipments up almost 20% this year. More than 70% of our FlexPod systems are shipped with clustered ONTAP. All-flash FAS with clustered ONTAP is the only unified scale-out all-flash array on the market and gives customers the ability to deploy a high-performance node in their storage pool without having to make compromises.","The clustered ONTAP-based all-flash arrays have demonstrated the ability to match the performance and efficiency claims of the point product all-flash solutions, while uniquely delivering the scalability of clustering and the industry-leading data management of ONTAP. Rather than creating yet another island of infrastructure, NetApp seamlessly integrates flash into our data management framework that not only extends to discs but to the cloud as well.","Shipments of all-flash FAS grew significantly at more than 350% from Q4 a year ago and for the full year, they grew 260%. In the fourth quarter, 72% of all-flash FAS arrays shipped as clustered configurations. Ultimately, we remain confident in the innovative value proposition that clustered ONTAP offers IT organizations as they build out their hybrid cloud environments.","Customers and partners who have made the transition to clustered ONTAP are growing and this underpins our confidence that now is the time to position investments towards our three priorities of accelerating the migration to clustered ONTAP, regaining traction in the channel, and increasing our sales capacity.","I'll now turn the call over to Nick to provide details on the fourth quarter and our expectations for the first quarter and fiscal year 2016. Nick?","Nicholas R. Noviello - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Operations","Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. We are disappointed that our performance in the fourth quarter fell outside of our previous guidance ranges. As Tom discussed, we are experiencing not only a market transition but a transition related to clustered ONTAP. We achieved our financial targets in the first half of fiscal year 2015, but in the second half a combination of FX headwinds and weakness in our Americas commercial geography negatively impacted results.","While we are confident in our strategy and technology, we need to retool aspects of our business to position NetApp for long-term growth and strong sustainable shareholder returns. We expect that there will be disruption related to this transition in retooling during the first half of fiscal year 2016 but that by the second half we will return to a growth trajectory and to our business model. I will talk through this further after I review Q4 and fiscal year 2015 results.","Net revenues for Q4 were $1.54 billion, down about 1% sequentially and down about 7% year-over-year. Our results fell short of our previous guidance range due to the impact of continued weakness in our Americas commercial sales geography and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. FX headwinds reduced sequential growth in Q4 by about two points and year-over-year growth by about three points.","For fiscal year 2015, net revenues were $6.12 billion, down 3% from fiscal year 2014, reflecting about a point of foreign exchange headwind. Our revenues were on plan in the first half of the fiscal year, but lower-than-expected branded revenue negatively impacted the second half.","Branded revenue was 93% of net revenues in Q4 and at $1.44 billion was up 1% sequentially and down 7% year over year. The year-over-year decline reflects four points of foreign exchange impact with the remainder due to weakness in our Americas commercial geography. OEM revenue of $102 million was down 18% sequentially and down 7% year over year, in line with expectation. For the year, branded revenue was $5.6 billion, down 2% from fiscal year 2014 and flat when adjusted for FX, again reflecting weakness in our Americas commercial geography.","OEM revenue was $473 million, down 19% from last year, as expected. OEM revenue ended the year at less than 10% of fiscal year net revenues and has normalized to a level of revenue that we will no longer be discussing separately.","Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs declined to 79% of Q4 net revenues compared to 81% in Q3 and 83% in Q4 last year. From a geographic perspective, all geos performed as or better than expected in Q4 when adjusted for FX with the exception of Americas commercial. Americas' commercial revenue declined 8% year over year, primarily driven by the challenges Tom talked about associated with our clustered ONTAP transition and sales coverage.","Product revenue was $913 million in the fourth quarter, down 2% sequentially and 12% year over year. Adjusted for FX, product revenue was down 8% year over year. Over the course of fiscal year 2015, including in the fourth quarter, we saw an increase in the number of short-term support renewals. We believe these renewals would show up on the balance sheet largely in short-term deferred revenue are an indication that customers remain committed to NetApp, but are not yet ready to do a tech refresh and to upgrade to clustered ONTAP. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues totaling $626 million in the fourth quarter was up 3% year over year or 5% adjusted for FX.","Non-GAAP gross margin of 62% was down 2.6 points from Q3 and below our prior guidance range. Product gross margin of 53.4% was down 5 points year over year due to FX headwinds, higher discounting, and unfavorable product mix. Software maintenance gross margin was down almost a point year over year but flat to Q3. Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 62.6% was relatively flat year over year, reflecting increased revenue offset by infrastructure investments in people and projects.","For fiscal year 2015, gross margin of 64% was almost a point above fiscal year 2014 and at the high end of our previous guidance range. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 15.6%, below our previous guidance range due to lower revenue and gross margins. We held operating expense dollars flat from Q4 a year ago, aided in part by favorable foreign exchange. However, operating expenses rose as a percentage of revenue, as we were not able to reduce costs in the business at the same pace as the revenue declined.","Operating margin for the full year was down just over a point from fiscal year 2014 and a point below our previous guidance.","Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.65 was below our prior guidance range due to lower revenue and lower gross margin. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16.5% for fiscal year 2015 and 16.7% for the fourth quarter, slightly higher than prior guidance reflecting normal course year-end true-ups.","Q4 weighted average diluted share count of 313 million shares decreased by almost 4 million shares from Q3 due to repurchase activity in the quarter. Over the course of the year, we reduced weighted average fully diluted share count by 8% to 321 million shares.","Now, turning to cash and balance sheet metrics. We closed fiscal 2015 with just over $5.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, approximately 11% of which is on shore. Inventory turns decreased to 16 due to a buildup of finished goods to support a higher anticipated level of demand than was recognized. Days sales outstanding increased to 46, reflecting typical seasonality.","Deferred revenue was up $88 million in Q4 versus Q3 and up $97 million from Q4 last year. Free cash flow of $359 million was about 23% of net revenue in the fourth quarter. Over the course of the year, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, marking the fifth consecutive year of strong performance. At approximately 18% of revenue, fiscal year 2015 free cash flow was within our previous guidance range.","Finally, we repurchased approximately $246 million of stock and paid $51 million in cash dividends during the quarter. We completed the $3 billion share repurchase program we announced in May 2013 a year ahead of our original schedule. We also commenced purchasing stock related to the $2.5 billion share repurchase program we announced last quarter. As you may recall, our board of directors authorized $2.5 billion of repurchases by the end of May 2018 with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016.","We have enhanced our capital structure, and during the year once again delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest in the business. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders since May 2013.","Today, we announced an increase of 9% to our next cash dividend to $0.18 per share of the company's stock that will be paid on July 23, 2015. We have now increased the dividend 20% since announcing the program in May 2013. At current stock prices, the new dividend rate represents a yield of approximately 2%, which reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of the underlying business and our ongoing commitment to driving shareholder value.","Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our business outlook and guidance. We remain confident in our business over the long-term. However, consistent with Tom's comments, we are in a period of transition and consequently expect some impact while we retool the business for the future. The disruption related to this transition will impact the first half of fiscal year 2016, but by the second half, we expect to return to a growth trajectory and to our business model. Related to this transition, we are focused on balancing disciplined investments with profitability to drive our business priorities and ultimately generate value for shareholders.","With respect to our expense structure, we are intent on returning to a level of operating expenses commensurate with our operating model. We are committed to looking for efficiency, taking cost out of our structure and to redirecting resources and people to highest return activities. We recently executed a set of decisions across our cost structure that will generate savings in fiscal year 2016, including a reduction of our global workforce by approximately 4%.","For fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to be no better than flat with FX headwinds and limited top-line predictability in the first half and an overall recovery and revenue growth in the second half. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth and our continued actions to drive down costs, we expect fiscal 2016 gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about one point from fiscal 2015, ultimately related to the clustered ONTAP transition.","We expect operating margin as a percentage of revenue to be down one point to two points for the year but to return to our 18% to 20% target operating margin range by the second half. We expect a year of continued strong cash flow generation as well as deferred revenue growth.","Finally, we expect to continue to repurchase our stock and based on the current prices, reduce share count by another 5%. This equates to a return of over 100% of free cash flow to shareholders again in fiscal 2016. We expect our Q1 net revenues to range between $1.275 billion and $1.375 billion, which at the midpoint implies a sequential decline of approximately 14% and an 11% decrease year over year. This is despite a 14-week quarter in Q1, an event that occurs every six years.","As we begin the year, we expect to continue to be negatively impacted by FX as well as disruption related to the transition to clustered ONTAP and a one-time increase in lead times due to a factory move. We expect Q1 consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5% and operating expense before the 14th week to be approximately flat to Q4. That said, given the decline in net revenues and gross margins and the increase of operating expenses, we expect Q1 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 6% to 7%.","Based on our stock repurchases in Q4 and in the first 10 days of Q1, we expect our diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 315 million shares and non-GAAP earnings per share for Q1 to range from approximately $0.20 to $0.25 per share.","In closing, NetApp is uniquely positioned to help customers as they navigate the transformation of their IT deployments by providing a bridge from the choices of today to their requirements for the future. We are firmly convinced that the investments we are making today will position NetApp for long-term success and enable us to quickly return to our operating model.","Finally, our capital allocation strategy continues to reflect confidence in our ability to generate significant free cash flow, which will enable us to invest both organically and inorganically in the business as well as continue to return significant capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Now, I would like to turn the call back to Tom for summary comments. Tom?","Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Nick. NetApp is in the midst of two transitions, one faced by all IT vendors, the shift to the cloud; and one that is NetApp-specific, the transition from legacy ONTAP to clustered ONTAP. We are confident in our ability to navigate these transitions, but expect some amount of turbulence over the course of fiscal year 2016. Our disappointing top-line growth in the second half of fiscal year 2015 has likely resulted in some market share loss, but we are confident in our ability to gain share going forward. Our best-of-breed solutions compete effectively against point products and are integrated to a broader vision for the hybrid cloud that only NetApp can deliver.","Our portfolio of data management solutions offers a differentiated approach that enables customers to solve today's problems with a technology set that provides a path to the future, improving their ability to navigate through the evolving IT landscape. Clustered ONTAP is the foundation of a data fabric vision, providing customers efficient and consistent data management that spans the hybrid cloud and unifies isolated data resources.","OnCommand Insight, FlexArray, and Cloud ONTAP help drive our value proposition outside of our installed base. Our flash solutions deliver industry-leading performance coupled with enterprise hardened software. NetApp private storage for cloud, SteelStore and StorageGRID Webscale offer customers a secure way to leverage the resources of the hyperscale cloud providers.","We have three clear priorities for investments: accelerating the migration to clustered ONTAP, regaining traction in the channel and increasing our sales capacity. Our strength of conviction in the benefits of those investments comes from the fact that customers and partners that have moved to clustered ONTAP are growing. It is our imperative to transition more customers and partners to clustered ONTAP.","We believe that these investments will drive long-term revenue growth, although that growth will be somewhat muted and will ramp over time as we work through our transition and shift to the hybrid cloud. We expect the investments we are making today will be catalysts for growth and drive improvements in the second half of the year, putting us back on our operating model in the second half of fiscal year 2016 and with momentum going into fiscal year 2017.","Before closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their dedication and focus on execution as we work through this transition.","At this point, we will open up the call for Q&A. As always, I ask that you be respectful of your peers on the call and limit yourself to one question so we can address as many as possible. Thank you.","Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question comes from the Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. I have a (33:42) simple question and a follow-up. Tom, a question for you on the transition on clustered ONTAP. I'm just \u2013 I was looking at the last transcript and on there you talked about ONTAP meeting the technical requirements of your largest customers and most demanding customers. But it sounds like it was kind of a release and it didn't? What I'm trying to (34:02) understand what exactly (34:03) what you thought the last three months ago to actually now in terms of this actual release and how the customer feedback has gone? What exactly went wrong and what's causing this transition, frankly?","And then just for Nick, I understand the operating margin decline that you spoke about. I think you said down to about 6% to 7% in the first quarter. What's the gross margin direction? I assume it's going down. I'm trying to (34:27) understand how much is negative OpEx average (34:28) versus gross margin. Thanks.","Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think \u2013 first of all on clustered ONTAP, as we went into the year and even as the year progressed is we got off to a pretty good start and we were ahead of our internal plan at the halfway point and it seems like things were picking up. And we felt on prior calls like this, we talked about where the optimism in the second half and we certainly knew that we were going to get easier compares on the U.S. public sector and we certainly saw that come to fruition.","And the other side is the breadth of the product portfolio. We had a lot of new products in the portfolio, whether it be E-Series or StorageGRID or OnCommand Insight and that. And the other key thing was that we had the release of 8.3 coming, 8.3 of clustered ONTAP. And it was my full intention that that was going to be a big growth stimulant for us. In terms of feature gaps relative to prior releases and 7-Mode, in terms of customer inhibitors, those have been substantially closed, in fact, almost entirely closed.","The really key one on this one was really around high availability for our most complicated workloads. And not only closing features, so it's not like we just caught up to where we used to be. We've got a lot of compelling functionality here that doesn't exist at any other \u2013 in any of our raw (35:49) products or any of our competitors' products. Also built in this was a set of tools to help with the transition. We had \u2013 around the FAS2000 family, we had efficiency capabilities to make clustered ONTAP the natural target for the FAS2000 as well.","And we had a lot of performance enhancements particularly around all-flash FAS and other things around quality of service. So from a technical perspective, I think the confidence was very, very, very high that this was going to be the release that customers were going to go to. And certainly the new customer wins validated our confidence in the value proposition. And this was the one that customers are going to migrate to. And all of that, everything that I previously said, remains unchanged. There is no evidence that customers are rejecting this technology or isn't meeting their expectations. That is not the story that we're getting.","I mean clearly the flaw here on our part is that we underestimated the complexity of these transitions, the planning associated with it, and frankly, the dependence on us to help them through that.","So I mean at the end of the day, I think these are the most sophisticated customers. These are our largest customers. These are the ones that are running high availability and the process changes, the getting downtime, downtime windows, all of that is proving to be a lot more complicated and a lot more time-consuming than we originally anticipated.","So simply put, that's on us. That's entirely our fault and it's up to us to fix it. And the good news here is that there isn't a technical impediment. It isn't something that we wish we had or some technical invention that we need to have to complete the vision here. The product is what it is. It's exactly what we expected it to be, exactly what we wanted it to be, and we need to power through this and get our customers to transition.","Nicholas R. Noviello - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Operations","Hey, Kulbinder. It's Nick. Let me address your question on the gross margin direction and the operating margin perspective for Q1. So the gross margin for Q1 should be in the 63% to 63.5% range. That includes about a point of foreign exchange pressure in there. I think to get to the operating margin, you have to be, have a couple of things in mind. One is this 14th week quarter we have, this is the once-in-a-six-year event type of thing. So if you build that in, we've actually taken the revenue down on a sequential basis much more substantially than we've done in prior Q4 to Q1 transition. So if I normalize out that 14th week, move in manufacturing that we're doing, I'm down about 15% sequentially versus my typical 10%. Right? You take that down at that 63% to 63.5% gross margin, then you have to go through the operating expense side of the fence.","In essence, our operating expenses for the first quarter will be flat to Q4 before the 14th week. If you add in the 14th week, that's an additional about $40 million of expense. So I'm trying to walk you through the pieces of math here, but suffice it to say that the gross margin percentage range should be about 63% to 63.5%, including about a point \u2013 reflecting about a point of FX pressure. But you really have to think about the implications of the 14th week on operating expenses, which means operating expenses are going up by that, and then the implications of really what we're doing on the revenue side, which is saying, yes, we get some 14th-week benefit, however, we're taking a step down here to be reflective of the transition we're in.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Alexander from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Nick, you said you'd return to normal growth in the second half of the year. I just wanted you to clarify that, because I think Q1 is going to be down low-double digits year over year. So are you expecting some well-above seasonal quarters in the back half to get to, to get the market growth, because it's just hard to make the math work on that?","Nicholas R. Noviello - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Operations","Well, so first of all, Brian, a couple points. So what I'm saying in terms of revenue for the year is don't expect any more than flat. Okay? So what I'm saying in terms of the operating margins of the company, I would say that the operating margins in the back half we expect to be back in the range that we've talked about before, so I'm talking about beta (40:21) 18% to 20% range in the back half of the year.","I also expect that from a cash flow perspective that as we get into that back half of the year we're going to be back to the cash flow ranges that we've talked about generating, which is the 17% to 19% on free cash flow. So I'm not talking about market growth here. What I'm talking about is don't expect more than flat revenues, but expect us from an operating model perspective to get back to those percentages we've talked about as a percentage of revenue for both our profit margin as well as cash, free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. And then I think the other thing here that I pointed out is that we've taken costs out and you should expect that we will be very focused on costs as we roll through this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Tom, I was hoping you could give us a couple of metrics on how much your installed base has transitioned to clustered ONTAP, considering that it's taking a bit longer? I think you gave a number of 50% of the nodes are going to clustered ONTAP, so trying to reconcile that with the slow adoption by customers. I'm just trying to understand what gives you the confidence that customers will start to adopt clustered ONTAP later in the year. Thanks.","Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. In terms of shipments, if you look at the various categories of the products, we are well over 50% of the shipments, we're over 70% of the bookings. Our largest machines are in the 80% range. Our mid-range machines are in the 70% range. And the low end of machines really weren't, because of a bunch of technical reasons, really weren't going to convert over to clustered ONTAP until 8.3, and that's happening now.","So 50% of the models, but the models that are targeted for clustered ONTAP are well up in the two-thirds to three-quarters. But \u2013 and that's an important metric and one that we track constantly. It's not the only metric. The metric that's also important is what percentage of our installed base has converted over? So if customers are in a mode where \u2013 the methodology by which they convert to clustered ONTAP typically involves buy new equipment and then basically migrating the data over. So most big ONTAP transitions occur in conjunction with tech refreshes.","So if the customers in the category are saying, okay, 8.3 is the least I'm looking for beginning to start my planning process, but I'm not going to buy hardware today and then move to it and then do another migration in the future. I'm going to do both of those at the same time. And that's where the delay comes in. So we could ship 100% of the new systems out the door with clustered ONTAP on them, but if old machines aren't being upgraded then those customers aren't buying those new systems. So that's really the key metric is which \u2013 what percentage of our big customers are moving to clustered ONTAP now?","Now the question of, well, is there something else at play here? If one of the reasons was if they basically had lost their patience or they weren't going in a different direction, I think they would have gone there by now. Our issue at this particular point in time isn't that customers are waiting for the next 20 things to come along. Our issue is okay, this is the release, we've been waiting for these things, it's here now, how do we go about doing this process?","And would they consider a competitor products at this point in time? If the reason that they've been delaying is because they've been waiting for new features to come along, they're not going to go to another product with even a more complicated migration that's actually missing even more features.","So I think that the customers that are at this stage are onboard. They're continuing to do service renewals. We certainly see that. And we saw our deferred revenue actually grow year-over-year, which is an indication that people aren't buying the tech refreshes, which hurts us on the product side, but they are renewing and they are continuing to run this equipment, so it's not like they've made other decisions. And I think that as the equipment gets older and with 8.3 meeting their needs, there is a lot of pent-up business behind that and we need to power through it.","And could we have been more prepared for it? Absolutely. That's the lesson we're learning here today. But that's the area, the constrained investment environment, that is the place that we are investing our money to get customers through this transition, because the other thing that we see in the data is that those customers that have successfully transitioned to clustered ONTAP, they are doing capacity expansion and software connect rates that are above the industry averages. So from our point of view is the healthiest thing we could do for our businesses is to gather as much of our installed base as possible to clustered ONTAP.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Noland from Robert Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about direct versus indirect. Tom, I believe you said there was a focus on regaining traction in the channel, but if you go back to the Analyst Day, there was some talk of consolidating to some of your larger partners. So just wondering how much of changes in the channel, excuse me, have had an impact on your business?","Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think certainly as we look at our channel base, we have a very, very, very large number of channel partners and a very, very long tail of active partners that aren't doing a lot of business, and a lot of our business is concentrated at the top. So clearly making our largest partners more successful, has been a focus. And in fact, our largest partners actually had a pretty good year with us last year in terms of our reseller partners.","I think the channel is also seeing the dynamics around clustered ONTAP. Those that have made the investments, some of our partners were the first to go; in fact that was going to be a differentiator for them and they were going to lead the way. And I think they've done a really good job in terms of getting their customers transitioned, being trained up and actually using this to sell to new accounts. Other of our partners who are back behind this, they're watching customers not necessarily upgrade and that's impacting not only the NetApp business but it's also impacting our mind share with them around the other elements of the portfolio.","So as I look at the business, clearly, we got to get the channel partners trained up, get them through that transition, and we also need to get them actively engaged with the rest of the portfolio, both things that are ONTAP based like all-flash FAS as well as E-Series and OnCommand Insight and the rest of it.","The one other point that I'd also point out is that it's not only direct and indirect. We look at our customers, we've talked about Storage 5000 in the past, but we have our largest accounts, our big global accounts, and for the first three quarters of this year those were all growing. And it says that where we've got account intensity, even despite these other issues with clustered ONTAP, we were selling other elements of the portfolio, particularly OnCommand Insight, which had a huge year in our big accounts. So where we had account intensity we could basically still drive growth despite the ONTAP slowdown, but it's taken a lot of resources to do it.","The next generation of accounts will have adopted the next thousand accounts, beyond that we have what we used to call the rest of the Storage 5000, beyond that the mid-size business. Those bottom two categories which are primarily channel driven actually did reasonably well also. The category where we struggled was that next generation beyond the top global accounts, those are primarily direct led. They may be fulfilled indirect or not, but there is a big NetApp presence in those accounts. And I think that's where the dilution of resources came in. And as we spend a lot of time on our global accounts, make sure we shored them up, but we've not been nearly as diligent on that next thousand.","And my simple observation as I watch the business is yeah, there is kind of a tough macro backdrop, there aren't as many deals as there used to be. But when there is business and when we show up and when we compete, we're winning more than our fair share. So win rate is not our issue. We need to be in front of more accounts. And that next thousand is an area focus. That's why we talked about clustered ONTAP transition, we talked about investment in the channel, but we just plain need more sales capacity to be telling this story to more people, and there is just as much conviction about that now as there was 90 days ago, and we're in a situation now where we're back to full strength.","We're continuing to investment beyond that, but we also have to go through the training cycle and get people up to speed, and that's kind of where the state of play is here. But there is no doubt that when we show up in front of our people, or our trained partners are in front of people that NetApp can close and NetApp can win.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Maynard Um from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Maynard J. Um - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to focus a little bit on the back half and the recovery and the confidence you have. Are customers indicating they have migration plans? Or is this \u2013 how long does a typical migration take? Is this purely a function of having enough people to do the migration? Or are you kind of going under the assumption that the one-year service renewals will convert to product sales at the end of the extensions? And then just directly related to that, understanding customers are unlikely to move to other on-prem solutions, is there any reason why we shouldn't anticipate that customers might use this transition to negotiate price, because it sounds like the gross margins are going to go back to sort of the normalized level, so I'm just curious why you wouldn't anticipate that in a transition like this? Thanks.","Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, these migrations, I don't want to use the word complete around them per se. Some of these migrations and individual customers include hundreds, if not thousands of machines in dozens of countries. And so there is a planning cycle that they need to get through that they could start a migration. So they could be doing migrations through that entire estate over an extended period of time, and that's okay. Well, we can't be in a situation where they aren't starting that process because they're in the planning cycle, and we need to help them with that.","So when we talk about investments and helping them through that, in some of those cases we will be directly involved. And in some of those cases where they're very, very strategic and there is a lot of business behind it, we're willing to do that at our own expense because it's in our best interest to do so and the customer's best interest to do so.","But the goal is on these really, really big accounts, once they get this thing rolling, you will have a process and it may take some time. But while they were in the planning cycle, at least for that use case and that workload that's on that equipment, they're not inclined to basically make big hardware purchases around equipment that they aren't going to use right away. So from our point of view, it's what can we do to get them over this initial cycle, which is a lot of planning, letting them learn the tools that we have and also in our case, perhaps putting our own professional services resources against this problem and in some cases perhaps even giving them some gear.","That's not going to be the dominant case, we're not going to be able to do that across the board. But for some of the big accounts that we need to get going, that are willing to make that commitment if we're willing to invest and help them, that is already underway and we're doing that now in some very, very large accounts.","Nicholas R. Noviello - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Operations","Maynard, it's Nick. Why don't I just point out, we talked about a reduction in gross margin by about a point for the fiscal year. Actually, half of that point is going to be related to foreign exchange, obviously, from the first half of the year. We're going to normalize through that. So yes, there is investment built in, but there is also foreign exchange built in, so you should try to keep that in mind.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia from CLSA. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Louis R. Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thanks, Tom. I guess you've talked about the cloud, but there is many shifts that are going on in storage. You've got a product in the converged category doing well there, congratulations, but when you look at hyper-converged, hyperscale, the start-ups like Nimble and Tintri, software-defined, object storage, I know you've got a product there, and then obviously, just the cloud storage vendors or the cloud companies in general, I mean how do you rank these as secular shifts that are hurting you and possibly going back to your comment that you've lost a bit of share this year in conjunction, obviously, with what you've talked about with ONTAP?","Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think a treatise on all those topics could take a long time, but I think \u2013 we talked about radical transitions. The radical transition is the cloud, and the cloud dwarfs the impact of any of those other technologies. And some of these small companies, their incremental revenue year-over-year might be $50 million or $30 million or $100 million, and you look at the kind of money that's being invested in the cloud, and the cloud is not just the hyperscalers, it's also things like Microsoft Office 365 and Exchange and things like that that are moving to the cloud. So the cloud transition dwarfs all other transitions.","Everything else is technology based, and NetApp is a technology company, and the areas that we invest in we are confident in our ability to basically lead that technology and take leadership positions in those areas. So don't minimize the technology stuff. It's work, it's engineering, it's hard, but that's what we do.","The cloud is clearly the much \u2013 the thing that's roiling the industry at this point in time. There's no doubt about that. And our view on the cloud is rather than either deny the cloud or declare it a fad, or fight against it or position them as the competition, our view is to embrace the cloud, find a way to monetize it. And that's the rationale between the evolution of our product offerings. We talked about NetApp private storage, where the data remains on your network but you have access to the flexible compute of Amazon and SoftLayer and Microsoft.","We've got Cloud ONTAP, the ability to actually run ONTAP, build a virtual machine in the cloud, a virtual system in the cloud and buy it by the hour. And at the end of the day, the story is, is that, the cloud is going to be part of everybody's environment. It won't be everything.","We're a firm believer that everybody is going to have some combination of owned infrastructure and cloud infrastructure, and our job as a company, since our strength is data management, is how do we make that data management experience seamless across all of those domains? So one set of tools, one set of processes, one set of backup, one set of replication, whether data is on our equipment or not, or whether it's on-premise are not. And that's the value proposition that we're driving. And that's our definition of software defined. In fact, that's the epitome of software-defined. It's not a point solution for certain workloads. It's not some thin veneer of software over some very dissimilar hardware. This is one set of tools across all of these use cases.","So as far as the cloud is concerned, that is the thing that customers are talking about. Everything else, I'm not going to minimize it, we could talk about each one individually if you want, but the cloud is the big change. That's the one that's driving our strategy. And I've been doing a lot of these cloud pitches. I know some of you have seen the initial version of that at Insight, but it works, and we have a lot of momentum around it. Simply put, ONTAP on-premise is the story and the nut that we need to crack in the near-term.","The rest of it, whether it be our new products, whether it be our cloud strategy, that is clearly working for us and I'm extremely pleased with how that's going.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, Tom. Thank you. I wanted to ask about first on competition. You talked a lot about on the call the transition to 8.3, but if you could speak to in terms of new workloads or jump balls as I think about it, how do you see the level of competition there? And related, do you think your installed base is flat or declining at this point? And then I wanted to ask a follow-up, too. But let's start with that one, please.","Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the installed base is measured in units is actually growing and growing quite, quite substantially every year. So that \u2013 and that's a function of equipment not taking out of service, plus the thousands of new systems that we put out there every day. What we are not seeing is a bunch of machines that mysteriously are no longer being operated and dropping out of our order reporting database. So these machines are reporting back, which means that they are live, customers are applying maintenance on them. So that installed base is continuing to grow. So if there was this big competitive push that was taking us out of all those environments, we would effectively be seeing that go away, and we're not.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right.","Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In terms of the broader competitive landscape, certainly EMC and the other server vendors, there is usually one of them in every transaction that we do or every competitive situation that we're in. We certainly see the start-up vendors certainly not underestimating, but they are not ubiquitous like the other guys are.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right.","Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In terms of jump ball workloads, I think they fall into a bunch of different categories, whether it be analytic workloads, whether it be virtual desktop workloads, whether it be new apps workloads, webscale-type of things. I think where we're seeing the cloud and new application development is around a lot of these new workloads. Whether Hadoop is an on-premise solution, or whether we see analytics in the cloud, whether it be some of the customer service, whether it be the mobile apps, those types of things. And I think that those are very, very much a jump ball.","I think as far as the other vendors, I'd say certainly the hyper-converge, we see them in those domains. Flash is a little bit different, I think a lot of the flash battlefield is around some of the new workloads, particularly virtual desktop, but that's not big enough to support everybody's flash investment.","The other place where we clearly see flash is basically application acceleration in database, and generically high-performance SAN. So for NetApp, high-performance SAN has not been a historical strength of ours. Certainly with clustered ONTAP we want to compete more aggressively there, but that's not the installed base. It's not the NetApp installed base that's being fought over in the high-performance SAN market. So that's an opportunity that with clustered ONTAP and new, now with the all-flash FAS, the latest release and the performance benchmarks that we have that are compelling, it's something that we want to compete on more aggressively.","So I'd say it depends on the workload. I think the cloud is more relevant to next-gen workloads. And then we're starting to see flash around things like VDI, but a lot of it around accelerating traditional workloads, particularly around database acceleration.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Fair enough. And I just wanted to ask a follow up, Nick. Nick, what happens if your assumptions surrounding your growth potential and transition of 8.3 are incorrect? That is to say we get deeper into the year and NetApp continues to not be able to realize what you believe to be your growth potential. Nick mentioned you're taking out about 4% of your head count out in the risk. Do you see more opportunities if need be as you look out over the next number of quarters where NetApp could skinny up meaningfully, reduce its cost structure if that is what the situation warranted?","Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, actually I'm glad you ended the conversation that way. I think the lay of the land now based on kind of what we believe is achievable the rest of the year gets us back to our operating model in the second half. And the balance that we have clearly is we spend a lot of time on this portfolio, we know there are things that are under our control that if we can overpower it we believe can unlock growth, and at this point in time I don't want to preclude our ability to do that. So we're making the investments to go after that and go after that aggressively.","If it turns out that either the macro substantially deteriorates or our postulate is not correct, although we're pretty convinced that we're on the right track, or any number of other things come in the way and the business doesn't materialize, then clearly our current operating hypothesis will be invalidated and we're going to have to do other things. So certainly there is an opportunity to take more cost out of the infrastructure. I think to take more cost out of the infrastructure now when we know what big bets that we think we're on the cusp of realizing over the next six months to start to see impacts, then I think we want to make those bets now. But if they don't materialize, then clearly we need to rethink what we think the long-term growth rate of this business is, what we think the long-term growth rate of this industry is, and we have to look at our cost structure.","So we're not wedded to a dollar figure on the cost structure at this point in time. We're going to be practical. At this point, we took out a certain amount of head count, we took out well more than that and other infrastructure costs in the company, took a couple hundred million dollars out. So we're prepared to do more if the situation warrants, but right now I think we have a structure that enables us to still compete for this business. And if we're right in our hypothesis, then I think we win. And I think that we will be well served by preserving the investments we're making right now.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. Nick, I just maybe wanted go through the math for the full-year revenue expectations that are no better than zero percent growth I guess. If I look historically, July quarter fiscal Q1 tends to be about 23%, 23.5% of the full-year revenue contributions. If I play that out this time around, I get your sales to be down 9%, 10%. So I'm just curious, which of the next three quarters you think will punch in more than their historical weight to get you to a better trend than down 8%, 9%? If you maybe just help understand that math, that would be helpful.","Nicholas R. Noviello - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Operations","Yeah. Now, remember, what I'd also indicated at the beginning of this call was that we took down the front quarter associated with this transition, and we expect this transition to get its legs under it and get moving as we get to the back half of the year. So I do expect that the linearity is going to be a little different and that we will be back-end loaded. In addition to that, as you know, we're not going to have an FX compare in the second half of the year, at least at these rates.","So it's really the combination of those two things that you should think about in terms of the revenue and the no better than flat revenue guidance that we gave.","Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So first of all, thank you all for joining us on the call today. And if I look at where we are right now, we spend a lot of time talking about our cloud strategy and while early days and not moving the top-line needle, or not moving it enough, overall that story is working out well for us. If I look at the new products in the portfolio, the E-Series, the OnCommand Insight, those are meaningful businesses, over $100 million each growing 100% per year. I think we're quite pleased with that.","Clearly the situation that we're in now and the thing that we need to be very, very focused on, and we need to work our way through is this transition from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. And clearly we did not do a good enough job anticipating or putting in place the resources necessary to make that go smoothly for our customers, but that's something we can control and that's something that we can do. It's not a technical impediment for us going forward we just need to get on to these key initiatives that we talked about: getting clustered ONTAP transition; getting our channel partners up to speed and ready and regaining traction with them; and expanding our sales capacity and telling our story to more customers. So those are the bets. Those are entirely within our control. I see a direct line to success in those activities to ultimately revenue growth and that's how we can make the comments about the second half of the year.","So thank you very much for your time, thank you for your support, and look forward to seeing you all in 90 days.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.","Our Q2 FY'20 results reflect the strength of our business model and the value of our innovation. We delivered gross margin, operating margin and EPS all solidly above our guidance ranges. Despite the ongoing macro economic uncertainty and the potential for continuing unpredictability in enterprise purchasing behavior, the fundamentals of our business are strong.","I've just come from two great events, NetApp Insight and Microsoft Ignite and the many conversations I had with customers, prospects and partners both underscore the power of our data fabric strategy to differentiate our solution and highlight our success in reaching new customers and buying centers to expand our market share. At this year's Insight user conference, it was clear that we are solving real pain points for customers as they grapple with the complexity of hybrid multicloud IT. I witnessed the tangible enthusiasm for how we are helping customers address these challenges by building their own data fabric with net app. I'm sure those of you who were able to join us felt that excitement. We saw an increase in overall attendance and for almost half of the customer attendees, this was their first Insight. The number of executive level customers was up 80% from last year and the number of customers with cloud responsibilities doubled. Hybrid multicloud is the reality of customer's IT environment and NetApp has the strategy, the innovation portfolio and customer experience to help them succeed. At Insight, we announced that we are revolutionizing the customer experience and simplifying the business of hybrid multicloud with NetApp Keystone.","NetApp Keystone creates a consistent experience from public cloud to the data center helping customers transform IT to operate with cloud like ease and flexibility everywhere.","First, for customers who want truly elastic scaling without having to manage infrastructure, they can consume NetApp technology as a cloud service through the world's biggest public clouds.","Second, for customers who want a cloud like experience on-premises, we offer subscription services and finally for customers who want to own and operate technology in their own data centers, we've introduced a radically simplified ownership experience for how our customers buy, optimize and grow with NetApp. Customers and partners choose NetApp because of our unique ability to offer a full range of capabilities needed to build their data fabric. NetApp Keystone compliments this with a consistent cloud like customer experience across the public cloud and on-premises.","Let me be clear. Our approach to cloud is giving us access to new buyers and workloads as well as increasing the relevance of NetApp to companies both large and small. Cloud gives us both opportunity in the public cloud and makes us more attractive for on-premises deployments. While I'm heartened by the enthusiasm generated by our hybrid cloud data services, the headwinds we identified a last quarter's call persisted through Q2. Both macro economic and enterprise spending indicators show continued weakness. While we cannot predict when conditions will improve, we are planning our business assuming no change in these external factors for the foreseeable future.","I'm pleased with our sales discipline and the ability to capture value in this tough market. To that point, our product gross margins demonstrate that we were able to maintain pricing discipline despite the soft environment. Regardless of what is happening in the broader macro environment, I remain confident that we can return to growth because of our ability to deliver real business value to customers hybrid multicloud environment. This increases our strategic relevance and enables us to reach new buyers through new pathways, address new workloads, and expand our presence with existing customers.","To better capitalize on our opportunity and replicate our proven areas of success, we laid out a plan for you last quarter that includes increasing sales capacity by approximately 200 primary sales resources by the end of Q1 FY'21 without adding to the total operating expenses for the company. As of the end of Q2, we are well on track to deliver against this goal. The sales headcount will be deployed primarily in our America's geography. They bring capabilities to acquire new accounts as well as engage new buyers with new sources of funding like cloud architects and existing accounts.","As a reminder, we expected to take roughly three to four quarters to bring these resources up to full productivity and the vast majority of the benefit of this additional capacity will be realized next year in fiscal year '21. We are also sharpening our attack on the key market transitions of this to flash, traditional IT architectures to private cloud and on-premises to public cloud.","In Q2 our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services was up 29% sequentially to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.2 billion. We have industry leading guaranteed storage efficiency, the highest performance and the most complete cloud integration in the market today. In the quarter, Gartner published its Magic Quadrant for primary storage and NetApp took the highest ranking in the leader's quadrant for both our ability to execute and for the completeness of our vision.","Moving to our private cloud solution. SolidFire, NetApp HCI and StorageGRID are the building blocks for private cloud deployments and enabling customers to bring public cloud like experience and economics into their data centers. Our private cloud business inclusive of products and services, a chained and annualized net revenue run rate of over $300 million in the second quarter up almost 30% year-over-year.","Now onto cloud data services. Based on the last month of Q2, our annualized recurring revenue for cloud data services increased to approximately $72 million up 167% year-over-year. We continue to see a healthy mix of customers new to NetApp in our cloud services and expect that our cloud services will continue to enable us to acquire new customers, reach new buyers, and expand the workload's managed at existing customers.","Q2 is the first full quarter that Azure NetApp files has been generally available and we're making great progress. At Microsoft Ignite, I spoke to many customers who are planning to move a broad range of enterprise workloads like Oracle and SAP into the Azure cloud with Azure NetApp files. Customers love that they get the widest choice of file protocols and on-premises class performance and availability within Azure consistent experience from procurement to support to billing.","A global energy company that's migrating high-performance workloads into the cloud for flexibility, scalability, global access and collaboration presented at Ignite about their experience with Azure NetApp files. The performance improvements they achieved are outstanding, simulation run times were reduced from months to days and in some cases hours. To quote the customer 'Azure NetApp file is a lifesaver' and that's just one example of the excitement we hearing from customers about what we're doing in the cloud.","Our cloud volume services available in all three leading hyperscalers and gives us access to new opportunities from non-enterprise customers where our traditional solutions do not economically reach to new strategic buying centers in the world's largest enterprises where we are only a small part of their infrastructure, we are expanding addressable market with our cloud data services.","Our many years of work and deep integration with the leading public clouds give us a sustainable competitive advantage in the hybrid multicloud. We're delivering an enormous amount of value to a growing number of customers, operating and planning to operate in a hybrid multicloud world. We're adding new customers each day. We're adding new use cases each week and we're adding new cloud regions each month to deliver the world's best hybrid cloud data services.","As I've said before, customers and partners are choosing NetApp because of our data fabric strategy and our unique relationship with the hyperscale cloud providers. Our cloud data services not only give us access to customers and workloads that work heretofore inaccessible with our traditional solutions. They improve our competitive position for on-premises opportunities. Only Net app has the strategy, innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multicloud IT.","We've made a lot of progress in delivering on our data fabric strategy. Our on-premises solutions are highly differentiated as evidenced by a strong product gross margin. We are now available in the three leading clouds. We have delivered both the technology and the customer experience needed for success in the hybrid multicloud and we are improving our execution and adding demand generation resources to drive new sales motion, but it is early days and we have more work to do to communicate the full scope of our capabilities as we saw it inside in Ignite, our story resonates with customers, because of this, I am confident in our ability to return to growth. We will continue to return capital to shareholders while investing for the long-term health of the business and capitalizing on our unique ability to help customers navigate the complexities of the hybrid multicloud.","Before closing, I want to share some news about our organization. Henri Richard, Executive Vice President for Worldwide Customer and Field Operations has left me know of his intent to retire at the end of the fiscal year. Over the past 3.5 years at NetApp, Henri has done much to transform and modernize our sales force to take advantage of the strength of our data fabric strategy and our technology leadership as we pivoted to new buying centers and the growth areas of the market. Henri will participate in the search for his replacement and help in a seamless transition while continuing to lead the field and improving our execution.","At the same time, I'm excited to announce the promotion of James Whitemore to Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. James came to NetApp in the SolidFire acquisition where he was CMO and has since been leading our demand generation and digital strategy in the marketing organization. As acting CMO, James has already made a strong impact and I'm glad to have him as the CMO of NetApp.","With that, I'll turn it over to Ron for more details on the quarter and our expectations. Ron?","Ron Pasek","Thanks, George. Good afternoon to everyone and thank you for joining us.","As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted.","As George highlighted, in Q2, we delivered strong margins and operating leverage in the face of continued caution from our customers as a result of the macro environment. Despite the demand uncertainty, we are confident in our product leadership and strategy to reaccelerate growth going forward. We also remain committed to our capital allocation strategy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and our healthy quarterly dividends.","Before discussing our guidance, I'll provide further detail on our Q2 performance. In Q2 net revenues of $1.371 billion were down 10% year-over-year, including 1 point of currency headwind. We had zero ELA revenue in the quarter compared to roughly 20 million of ELA revenue in Q2 '19, product revenue of $771 million decreased approximately 16% year-over-year. Adjusting for ELAs, Q2 total revenue would've been down approximately 8% and product revenues would have been down approximately 14%.","Moving down the P&L, software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $540 million was flat year-over-year. Deferred revenue increased 8% year-over-year in Q2. Gross margin of 68.6% was above the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 57.3%, which is an increase of 3.2 points year-over-year and above our long-term target of 56% outlined at our Analyst Day. The improvement was driven by continued sales force discipline and increase in all-flash product mix and cost reductions and includes nearly a 0.5 of currency headwinds.","Q2 was the 11th straight quarter, we increased product margins year-over-year when adjusting for the benefit of ELAs. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services, gross margin, 83% increased by over 150 basis points year-over-year driven by continued productivity improvements. Q2 operating expenses of $631 billion were down 3% year-over-year driven primarily by a reduction in variable compensation. Operating margin was 22.5% solidly above the high-end of our guidance range.","Despite the revenue headwinds, EPS of a $1.09 was up 3% year-over-year and above the high-end of our guidance demonstrating the operating leverage in our business model.","We closed Q2 with $3 billion in cash in short-term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a negative four days up 15 days, year-over-year. DSO of 52 days was up six days, year-over-year due to linearity in the quarter and to a lesser extent customer mix. DIO was 23 days, a nine day increase year-over-year. We continued to expect our cash conversion cycle to remain negative throughout fiscal 2020. Cash flow from operations was a negative $53 million, while free cash flow was a negative $89 million. The negative Q2 cashflow metrics are due to timing and do not reflect a change in our underlying business. The timing issues were primarily the accounts receivable. Additionally, there is a shift in the linearity of cash tax payments in FY'20.","We are maintaining our expectations for free cashflow to be in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues in fiscal 2020. During Q2, we repurchased 9.8 million shares at an average price of $51.19 for a total of $500 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 236 million down 28 million shares year-on-year representing an 11% decrease.","During the quarter, we paid out $111 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $611 million to shareholders in the quarter. Our fiscal Q3 cash dividend will be $0.48 per share.","Now onto guidance. We expect revenues for fiscal 2020 to be down approximately 8% year-over-year. We continue to expect ELAs to represent approximately 2% of total revenue. For fiscal 2020, we now expect gross margin to be in the range of 67% to 68% above our previous guidance of 66% to 67% due primarily to the improvement in product margin. Operating margin for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 21% to 22%","Implied in this guidance, is our expectation that operating expenses will be down slightly year-over-year in fiscal 2020 due to lower variable compensation. As a result of the updated revenue and margin guidance, we expect EPS to be down between 5% and 8% year-over-year without the benefit of buybacks.","Now on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.39 billion and $1.54 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 6% decline in revenues year-over-year, including a 0.5 of currency headwind. For Q3, we expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to be approximately 22%. We expect earnings per share for the quarter to range between $1.14 and $1.22 per share.","We are diligently focused on improved execution and addressing the challenges we face. We are committed to returning the company to growth and we remain confident, our business model leverage will enable us to deliver long-term shareholder returns.","With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?","Kris Newton","Thanks, Ron. We will now open the call for Q&A. We ask that you'd be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thank you. Your product gross margins is north of 57% have been very strong, we have not seen that in a while actually since 2015. Can you talk about how much of that product gross margin was product mix driven versus commodity price tailwinds or maybe even federal mix? And do you feel that you can sustain or expand these margins as you go into the back half of the year?","Ron Pasek","Yes, Wamsi. Good question. On a year-over-year basis, most of it was mixed meaning we saw a higher percent this quarter of all-flash that we did say last quarter. Some of that was also cost reduction, not just on other things as well. That was in the face of having ELAs in the quarter. That goes against you. I did contemplate the ability to keep this level of gross margin through the rest of fiscal year and you saw that in the increase of the total margin guide.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay, great. Thanks. And if I could really quickly on CDS, you exited last quarter with 5 million in monthly sales, seems like you exited this quarter with about 6 million despite Azure [indiscernible] quarter. Can you talk about, what are some of the challenges and not ramping this faster and I know George you expressed a lot of enthusiasm and all of your discussions with that Insight that big night? So, where do you expect CDS annualized revenue run rate could be as you exit fiscal '20. Thank you.","George Kurian","We aren't going to give you guidance on the CDS business. I think as we said, we've taken longer than we originally expected to get to general availability given the technical sophistication of what we are offering to customers. The total addressable market is there. We are seeing a lot of demand and interest from customers and we're adding customers and growing footprints on a daily basis. We are going to just need to keep doing the work necessary to scale and enable all of the pathways associated with being able to take the solution to market and to replicate the wins that we've got across a broad range of workloads into more customers. So, we're focused on execution at this point.","Wamsi Mohan","Thank you.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks, Wamsi. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.","Rod Hall","Yes. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to just check and see Ron, if you could comment on the accounts receivable and while the DSOs, the far highest we've seen, I think ever in our models. So just, I heard you say the tail end of the -- it was heavily back end loaded in the quarter, but any more color on that? And then the ELAs you're holding this 2% guide yet, there are no ELA so far. So just anything you can say that would help us all have more confidence that you've got visibility into that or are you still having to run on a treadmill to get them deals? Just kind of help us understand, why you still have confidence in that ELA guide. Thanks.","RonPasek","So, with respect to AR, it was linearity within the quarter and particularly within the month. And then to a lesser extent some of the mix of customers we saw that bought in the last two months of the quarter. You saw a similar phenomenon in Q4 where we added a pretty back end loaded. And of course, collected all of that AR in Q1, which yielded a bunch of cashflow. It happens sometimes.","The other issue with free cashflow and cashflow, which I mentioned in my script was larger cash tax payments. But I did reiterate the full year guidance 19% to 21% for free cash flow as a percent of revenue. With respect to ELAs, I'll make a comment and let George comment as well. Last year, this quarter we ended up giving you a full year guide of roughly 2% of revenue, we've to understand that we can't easily contemplate when those ELAs come in within each quarter. But for the full year we felt comfortable with that.","We did that based on extensive conversations with parts of the sales force, making sure they understood the importance of this and the fact that it has a huge impact on earnings because it's essentially pure profit. So, that was the further conversation this quarter and it led to the continued commitment for the second half.","George Kurian","With regard to ELAs, Rod, I think the fundamental thing that we are doing with them is to enable streamlined customer purchasing. It doesn't require them to spend the whole amount of the ELA upfront. It's really to make their overall multiyear procurement agreements with us a lot more streamlined and to enable us to get a broader strategic footprint in the account. We know these accounts, some of them have intending events that this would clearly enable things to get more streamlined. And so, we're working in, right? We have visibility into these accounts. We know who these accounts are and we're working hard to bring this forward.","Rod Hall","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Rod. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackermann with Cowen.","Karl Ackermann","Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for letting me ask question. Towards Ron, if I may going back to your outlook for December, it seems you are employing a not all-flash rate business will decline about 6% sequentially. That seems to be about in line with the seasonal averages of near line drives, but at the same time to have your hard drive suppliers have spoken about improved nearline shipments in December and for the first half of 2020 you know, when you also launched two new mid-range hybrid range at Insight. So, I don't know competitive forces impeding your ability to do a bit better in hybrid raise for the next few quarters or is he just conservative too? Thank you.","George Kurian","So, I'm not really sure I understand your question. We guiding total revenue. We're not even specific product revenue and within that, not all-flash. So, I'm not sure, I quite understand where you're going with that. But we feel good about our position in the hybrid array market. We are without question across a range of customer and analyst surveys, the best hybrid array vendor. We've introduced two new models. I think what we are framing up for the next quarter guide is really an overall product number. We're not forecasting it to the level of specific product components at this point.","Karl Ackerman","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Karl. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. George, I want to go back to the topic of installed base. In the past you've talked about installed base that is only penetrated in the teens. So how do you see, especially in the context of a strong AFA results for the October quarter? Thank you.","George Kurian","We are up a few percentage points. We're up at 22% of the installed base now being on AFA. As we've said before, our installed base is growing and so while we ship a lot of new systems each quarter, the size and scope of the installed base and its growth leaves the total AFA penetration at a small number which allows us to have opportunity to continue to refresh over time the rest of the installed base.","Mehdi Hosseini","Sure. Thank you. Just one clarification, if I may. Would end of life support for ONTAP 7 actually help, expedite or increase the penetration rate?","George Kurian","Some of those customers that have not upgraded so far, there is a small number. But certainly, some of those if they look at the economics today of a platform like our C190, they would choose to go all-flash than go to a 10K disk-based system, because the economics are already better with our solutions to replace 10K drives.","Mehdi Hosseini","Great. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Mehdi. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.","Aaron Rakers","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I'm just kind of want to understand a little bit on the guidance side. It would appear based on the gross margin guidance in the current quarter that you're not obviously factoring in ELA. I think last time, it's like a 400-basis point benefit that you saw in product gross margin. So, if that's true, and we kind of think about the setup going into the April quarter, it's kind of hit the full-year guidance level.","Number one are you factoring in a revenue contribution to kind of hit an absolute increase in revenue in the April quarter that includes an ELA and therefore we should also be thinking that the gross margin into that April quarter is significantly higher, just because that ELA contribution would fall into that, if you kind of hit that 2% of total revenue for the full year or is that just not factored into your guidance at all. I'm trying to understand how you kind of think about the mechanics of the implied guidance at the April quarter?","Ron Pasek","Yes. So, remember, as we go through the fiscal year this for Q3 and Q4, product revenue becomes a larger part of the total, which overall is dilutive to overall margin, right? So, you can't just look at the numbers that you're holding total margin flat to Q3 therefore, you don't have an ELA, because of mix of product versus services is higher in Q3 obviously. So, there is some ELA in Q3 and there are absolutely some in Q4.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. And on an absolute basis, April quarter versus what you've done over the past few years. I think early '18 the storage market was fairly healthy. So, I'm just trying -- you have a line of sight that says, look on the absolute sequential basis, you can kind of, see that kind of jump that you saw back in 2018 or is there something else that I'm just not thinking about in the model?","Ron Pasek","Well, again, you've got the benefit of ELAs in Q3 and Q4 which you didn't have essentially last year Q3, Q4 to a great extent. That helps in all the things meaningful.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks, Aaron. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Good afternoon. EMEA was stronger than other segments. Can you talk about whether that was your own execution, or did you see some improvement in the market and then just generally speaking, can you comment on the spending environment relative to the caution that you highlighted in the first quarter in the major segments? Thanks.","George Kurian","We saw Q2 relatively unchanged from Q1. And as we said at the start of the year, Q1 was a step down from calendar Q1 which was our fiscal Q4 of last year, but there were no major changes overall in terms of the trajectory from Q1 in terms of spending. Customers continue to be cautious. They are scrutinizing transactions. They're buying for what they need today and the differentiation for offerings is clearly visible in the fact that our gross margins were really, really strong.","With regard to EMEA, our teams have done a really good job and I want to salute our sales teams, there is a lot of execution that has been a big part of our strength in EMEA.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks, Katy. Next question.","Katy Huberty","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse.","Matt Cabral","Thank you. The services business was down a touch if you put together both hardware and software. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you are in addressing some of the renewal issues that you highlighted on prior calls and just how we should think about a return to growth for services going forward?","Ron Pasek","So, we've made some progress. You can see that we're essentially flat when you adjust for FX. We still have some work to do. There is some organizational work we're doing. There is some process work we're doing. You can't see that yet manifested itself in growth, but as George indicated the installed base is growing and we believe that eventually we will get back to growth as well. And you can see that in the deferred revenue number. So, it's not going backwards, which is good as it did in Q4 of last year, but we still have some work to do.","Matt Cabral","Got it. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Matt. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Alex Kurtz","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. George on the last call, it seems like the sales force productivity issue was really the main driver to the reset, and I'm sure we touched on macro in that call, but it just seemed like that was really the focus from the team. So then fast forward 90 days and you seem very optimistic about the hiring of the new reps and I just wonder what gives you the confidence, 90 days later, because it seemed like it was a pretty big step back internally as far as how the team is working, but maybe we were overestimating that and maybe things were as difficult to kind of fix as far as hiring productive reps and ramping them?","George Kurian","Listen, what we said on the Q1 call was that the quarterly results reflected two-thirds macro, one-thirds sales execution. And so, it was a reflection of the macro in the purchasing behavior of our largest customers that drove the majority of the impact in Q1. We've always believed that our portfolio is really strong and given our position in the market, we have ample room to capture more accounts and to invest some of the really strong gross margin leverage that we're seeing into investment in field sales coverage.","We've always believed, our story is differentiated in the market. We're doing exciting things and we are an attractive place to work. So, we've been pleasantly surprised with our ability to hire good quality salespeople and we're focused on getting them productive and ramping them.","I think I would just say we are heads down and focused on execution. Q2 saw an improvement relative to Q1 in terms of our ability to execute and capture the deals in front of us. We got to keep doing that. And I expect us to continue to do that through the course of the year.","Alex Kurtz","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Alex. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks for taking my question guys. I guess, Ron, you're taking up gross margins fairly notably for fiscal '20. Structurally, I'm wondering, do you think 67% plus gross margin that's something that's sustainable long-term? Or was there some specific benefits of it maybe more one-time in nature in fiscal '20 versus longer term? How do we just think about the levers that are enabling this upside?","And then George, how do you think about Dell's upcoming mid-range solution and what that could do from a pricing or competitive basis for you guys?","Ron Pasek","So, Amit, I think if you look at where we are in the quarter and then implied in some of the guide for the rest of the year, we are at the model we articulated at our Analyst Day for product margins 1.5 year ago. So, we said 55% at that point after the 606 change, I said 56% to 57%. And so, yes, I believe it's completely sustainable. It's a good 10 points below one of our competitors who is an all-flash competitor. It's 10 points above where we were two years ago so it's a really good place to be and it gives us a lot of flexibility to still be aggressive, but not under earn.","George Kurian","With regard to your comment about Dell EMC, we feel very good about our solution set. We are seen by Gartner and customers as the leader for Primary Storage and we are the only vendor in the market with a comprehensive cloud strategy. And so, we feel good about our position in the market and we are going to capitalize on it, which is why we are investing in sales capacity to go capture net new accounts and expand wallet share within existing accounts.","Amit Daryanani","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks Amit. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Vadheim with Wolfe Research.","Andrew Vadheim","Hi. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on a prior question and how it relates to guidance. So, you mentioned the weakness you're seeing and sort of deteriorating macroeconomic environment, but I'm just wondering why you decided then tightened the full-year guide especially on revenue kind of taking it from a 5-point range to 1-point estimate?","Ron Pasek","I think when you think about the guide, we have two quarters of actuals and guiding Q3 discreetly. So, you essentially have three of the four quarters. I think it would be strange to keep the same 5% to 10% down when in fact we kind of know where we think we'll be in Q4. Remember Q4 last year is a relatively easy compare, we were down 3%. So, getting to that number should not be that difficult whereas the first half of this year was much more difficult compare. Couple that with effect that we have ELAs in the second half, we didn't have in the first half just felt like it was a better thing to do.","Andrew Vadheim","Okay, thanks. And then separately, public sector was kind of down sequentially. Just was wondering to what extent that was expected and should we think of public sector sort of being in line with the rest of the company on a year-over-year growth basis and sort of Q3 and 4Q?","George Kurian","You know over the last year or two, we started to shift the mix of our public sector business to be more program-related and broaden the book of business beyond just the fed to state, local and higher education and other parts of the market. As a result, you will see the business trend toward more of a standard pattern as opposed to a big step up in Q2.","Andrew Vadheim","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Andrew. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James.","Simon Leopold","Thanks. I wanted to see if we could touch a little bit on what you're seeing in the macro environment given what we've heard from others reporting tonight. It sounds to me that maybe you saw some of the deterioration of enterprise demand a little bit earlier. And so, this is more of an issue of timing. And what I'm really looking for from you is, how the demand has maybe evolved or changed over the course of the quarter versus what you talked about in August. Is the weakness shifting among verticals, steady, how is it changed? Thank you.","George Kurian","I think in aggregate, we did not see a material change in Q2 from what we saw in Q1. With regard to the exposure of specific verticals and so on, we have a broad book of business. We wouldn't say that we are exposed to any particular vertical to be able to comment specifically about it. I would say it's reflective of the news that you see in the market, right? And there are teams in countries like Germany where the spending pattern is tight, who are executing really, really well for us. And we did see some slowdowns in other parts of the world, but nothing that's unique to NetApp.","And our view is, Q2 is reflective of a more stable long-term pattern that we see in the market and it is a materially changed from Q1 and that's what we're planning our business around. To capture the value from our differentiated offerings by being disciplined on price and extracting the value that we feel we deserve, and then investing some of that benefit from gross margin and operating margin leverage into the quarter bearing sales capacity that we talked about last time. And we feel that the combination of the two should allow us to bring -- get our business back to growth over time and continue to deliver the earnings model and returns to shareholders that we've committed to.","Simon Leopold","Thanks. Just to clarify one thing. Did you see seasonal strength in the federal vertical in the most recent quarter that sets up a tougher sequential comp in the January quarter, is that material for you? Thanks.","George Kurian","Our book of business in the public sector market is increasingly broad. We have diversified our book of business to be deployable in program spending, which is not driven by any specific seasonality pattern. We are growing our footprint in state and local governments, so the public sector business had its normal year end pattern, but the Fed business is a smaller component of our overall public sector business.","Simon Leopold","Thanks for taking the questions.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Simon. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.","George Iwanyc","Thank you for taking my question. George, you continue to be pretty bullish on adding new customers, especially with your cloud offerings. Can you give us a sense of whether that's share displacement there, primarily new workloads and is that transitioning over to some traditional storage sales as well?","George Kurian","We are certainly seeing a broad range of workloads being deployed on our cloud solutions, ecommerce, databases like Oracle and SAP HANA which are high-performance transactional workloads. We see genetics and bio science applications, vertical applications for oil and gas and healthcare. So, really broad set of applications that require consistent performance and high-availability. And I think that's what we are uniquely positioned in the cloud for.","There are customers and many that are saying that, listen, if you're going to use you in the cloud, we want to harmonize our on-premises environment, so that we can move workloads between the two landscapes. And with our announcement of Keystone, a subscription service for on-premises environments, we can now have not only the technology that allows them to standardize workload models between on-prem and public cloud, but the customer experience and the consumption offering that allows them to do that.","George Iwanyc","All right. And just expanding on your Keystone comments. How long do you think the selling motion will take to get that up and running?","George Kurian","I think that, listen, we don't believe that Keystone subscription services will replace CapEx purchasing, right? We think it will be a part of what customers want for their IT landscape. We are doing the work to enable our sales teams to be able to position that offering in the right way into customers and we think it will take time. We'll give you updates as we go.","With regard to our business model, we hold the assets on our books. You see depreciation, similar to what were in the P&L we have, we report cloud data services depreciation, right? So, it's not going to be material this year.","George Iwanyc","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, George. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.","Jim Suva","Thanks very much. And George, you've been very vocal about hiring more sales. And can you just remind us of the cadence, is it kind of higher during six months trained relationships, we're growing in six-month after. So, we're kind of looking at fiscal kind of '21 or kind of summer of next year always said the fruit really starts to bear from these efforts. Is that the right timeline or I might be off on that?","George Kurian","Just to go back to what we said. We said that we were going to hire 200 incremental demand generation headcount over four quarters with the last quarter being Q1 of fiscal '21 and we are on track. It takes three to four quarters to train a rep and to get them to full productivity. So, we think that the predominant benefit of this additional capacity will be in fiscal '21.","Jim Suva","Great. Thank you so much for the clarification. It's greatly appreciated.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Jim. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lou Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital.","Lou Miscioscia","Okay. Thank you. So, two questions sort of combined together. One of the things about the sales force, you said a good portion of the sales force wasn't selling the entire product line, given obviously the relationships they have there. I assume this is just more of a reeducation and maybe some adjusting to the sales plan. I'm just wondering, how is that actually happening? How is it going?","And then, combined with that maybe this is part of it obviously flash improved significantly on a quarter-to-quarter basis, just you went through some of the impacts last quarter, but how did you get flash bouncing back so quickly this quarter?","George Kurian","I want to credit the field organization for focus and execution, right? I think we said that what we were going to do was to focus on the big market transitions just to flash, traditional IT to public private cloud and the deployment of enterprise workloads in public clouds sort of the key areas where we would attack the market and I think credit to the sales leadership and the sales force for the progress in all-flash.","With regard to the comments you made earlier about our ability to sell the full portfolio, what we observe is that there are different buyers for some of our portfolio than the traditional storage buyer. Cloud architects, DevOps, staff and workload owners like application owners, we have been focused on reaching them and bringing them to our user conference, we saw a substantial uplift in the number of people from those pedigrees coming to our user conference, reflecting both the success of our field and marketing teams and reaching them over time, as well as the interest that we have in our portfolio, right? So, we need specific competency to go after those types of sales motions and we're bringing that into the company as part of our 200 headcount. And of course, we're focused on training the storage focused sales force on expanding their relevance to some of these new audiences.","So, work is under way as I said we're heads down in executing against these three imperatives. We saw the benefit of that focus in Q2 and we're going to continue to stay laser focused on that through the rest of the year.","Lou Miscioscia","Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Lou. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.","Ananda Baruah","Hi. Thanks guys for taking the questions. Ron, George. George, at your last Analyst Day, you guys talked about mid-single digit revenue growth. Now that you're getting the sales force, sort of call it reoptimized, I mean maybe reoptimized to think from the adding. Does the optimization process put you in the position longer term to give stronger revenue growth, if your marketplace optimize?","And then just real quick Ron, I believe you had some ELA expectation in the results for the quarter. So, and you basically did in revenues. So, do you outperform your internal product revenue targets for the quarter? Thanks guys. Thank you.","George Kurian","So, I think that we have many avenues to grow our business. We have a leading position in Primary Storage on-premises. We have a growing private cloud business and we are the only storage vendor who can support enterprise workloads in all of the major public clouds. And so, I feel like we have plenty of total addressable market.","We are focused on getting the company back on track to growth, right? And we'll tell you more about our long-term earnings model the next time we hold an Analyst Day. I will just tell you that we have delivered on all of the elements of commitments we made in terms of gross margins and operating margins and so on and barring the slowdown in enterprise spending this year, we were on track to meet even the top-line numbers that we had committed. So, we feel strongly about delivering on our commitments. Right now we are entirely focused on executing against the opportunities in front of us and getting the company back to growth and digital sales headcount funded by the strong margin profile of our business is the first step, getting them on board productive and all of that's the focus of the company right now. Ron?","Ron Pasek","And Ananda, you're right. I did and mention in the Q2 guide, we had factored in some amount of ELA which of course did not come through. And it was essentially the entire miss to the midpoint. It simply flaps into Q3. So yes, we've had sector where we thought with the exception that one ELA.","Ananda Baruah","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Ananda. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.","Nehal Chokshi","Yes. Thank you. So, really nice net new cloud ARR within the quarter of $11 million, which compares to $7 million in the year ago quarter. So that's very strong net new ARR growth. Is that all -- as they are files driven or sales capacity driven or something else?","George Kurian","The majority of our growth in cloud data services is from Microsoft Azure NetApp Files. We saw -- and the majority of that revenue is from net new customers, right? So, we don't have a single large customer that's a big percentage of the total number. We are seeing good momentum across a broad range of use cases and a broad range of customers trying things out and deploying their first workloads.","So, as we go forward, we are focused both on continuing to acquire new customers, but additionally to expand our footprints now that we've got success in some of these customers to broader sets of workloads. So, thank you for that.","Nehal Chokshi","And if I may. My understanding is that you do have some specialists trying to sell cloud data services. Although, I believe also the broader sales force is also capable. So, in the cloud services. What's the sourcing of this new cloud ARR between these two sales forces?","George Kurian","It's hard for me to comment on that. I think we've got multiple pathways into the market. We've got both specialists and generalists within our field who are focused on selling cloud data services as part of their remits. And we have the Microsoft pathway into market, which we are continuing to work to enable around the use cases and the expanding number of use cases of our technology. So, it will take time, but we're heads down and focused on it.","And we're really excited about how successful the technology is in serving the customers that have come on board, right? For things like databases and ecommerce and content management and media and life sciences and an incredibly wide range of applications, frankly more than I had expected. We have compelling business advantage that we offer customers.","Nehal Chokshi","Great. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Nehal. Next questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Todorov with Longbow Research.","Nick Todorov","Thank you. Apologize for the background noise. Service margins continue to tick up despite I think you guys are still investing a lot of the CDS business, which is a headwind, which should abate at some point. Ron, can you comment about the runway, or how do you see the opportunity to continue to grow services margins over time?","Ron Pasek","It's something that we are focused on in the sense that we're trying to get more efficient. Having said that, I don't want to be too much more higher than where we are today. It's not something I contemplated in our long-term guide at our Analyst Day, it's much about what we saw in this quarter. So, I think there is good work being done, there is some more work we can do, but [Technical Difficulty] upside to that number.","Nick Todorov","Okay. And if I can just follow-up, at some point you in order to hit the fiscal year '21 guide for CDS, there needs to be a step function increase I guess on a quarter-over-quarter basis. I guess what are the -- what needs to -- what work needs to be done. Do you guys need Google also to go general availability to kind of start seeing really that inflection. So, investors can get more confident around that target exiting fiscal year '21? Thanks.","George Kurian","We started, we got to general availability later than we expected, given the complexity of integrating a really high-performance service so deeply into these hyperscale cloud. We are at GA with Microsoft. We have clear line of sight into GA with Google. And we think that there is a broad -- the total addressable markets there. As I said earlier, the number of use cases that are being deployed on our platform is broader than we originally anticipated. And so, we've got work to do to execute to train the sales force, to train the Microsoft channel, get our message out to market and bringing the customers to be able to deploy them on our platform. We saw a good start to that with the attendance at Microsoft Ignite and at NetApp Insight where the number of people coming to talk to us and starts to do proof of concepts with us, were really good. So, we've got heads down. We got to deliver on getting these customers successful, but we feel like we got a really, really good platform and the early results have been really good.","Nick Todorov","Thanks. Good luck, guys.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Nick.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Fox","Hi, good afternoon. Just one question from me. George, obviously you're not making any grand ambitions about the macro, so when you mentioned the return of growth, I assume for next fiscal year. Is it mainly driven by the sales force execution or how would you sort of rank and characterize what's most important in terms of getting back to top-line growth? Thank you.","George Kurian","I think it's really making sure that we can capture the full range of opportunities that are available in front of us. As I said, we have leadership positions in a broad range of categories of primary storage. We are the only vendor with the cloud strategy and really compelling technology available in the big public clouds, all of the big public clouds. And we need to be able to go and access the customers that are making those decisions which is where the sales headcount focus is really a critical part of the go forward plan. The differentiation of our technology is evident in product gross margins, right? And the leverage of our business model is evident in the results we just showed and the guidance we gave.","And I think for us it's the macro is going to be the macro, we're going to go take share and to go after the addressable market. We are doing that prudently within the guidance of that we gave you and by prioritizing our resources against the biggest opportunities.","Steven Fox","I appreciate that color. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Steven. Next question.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel.","Matt Sheerin","Yes. Thank you. Could you talk about the contribution you saw in the quarter from your big distribution channel partners, several distributors and resellers have called out relative strength in the storage following your very weak June quarter. I mean is that a reflection of the middle markets being a little bit more stable or bouncing or any changes in your channel partner programs? Thank you.","George Kurian","The contribution of indirect channels to our business was relatively unchanged in terms of the overall mix of our business. It's approximately 80% each quarter, and we feel that that's well reflective of our overall book of business, nothing unusual there.","You are correct that the mid-market is relatively less concerned about the impact of the global economic slowdown and some of the uncertainty there. And we have more opportunities to capture share because our share in the mid-market is a bit smaller than it is in the enterprise. Our channel partners were focused on enabling focused set of channel partners, so that they get the full impact of NetApp's enablement resources and so we've got a narrow group that we work with, and we're pleased with the progress so far.","Kris Newton","All right. Thanks, Matt. I'll pass it back to George for some final comments.","George Kurian","Before we close, I want to underscore a few key points.","NetApp is helping customers deliver enormous business value in both traditional IT-led and increasingly in cloud-led use cases. Only NetApp has the strategy, the broad innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multicloud IT.","We believe we can return to growth over time by selling the value of our differentiated portfolio and investing in additional sales capacity to reach new buyers. As I saw at Insight and Ignite, we are making real progress here. We continue to be disciplined in our spending and have a strong financial model with growing gross margins and operating margins that enable us to return cash to shareholders and invest in the long-term health of our business. Thank you. And I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

My name is Latif and I will your conference call coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.","I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please proceed Ms. Newton.","Kris Newton","Thank you for joining us on our Q1 fiscal year 2020 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com.","During today\u2019s call we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects such as our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2020. Our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, shareholder returns and our ability to improve execution, gain share and expand our sales capacity without increasing total operating expenses, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. ","We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons including macroeconomic and market conditions, the IT capital spending environment and our ability to expand our total available market, acquire new accounts and new buyers, expand in existing accounts, capitalize on our data fabric strategy, improve the consistency of our sales execution and continue our capital allocation strategy.","Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019 including the Management\u2019s Discussion Analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factor sections and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. ","I'll now turn the call over to George.","George Kurian ","Thanks Kris. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. As we discussed on our call on August 1, while I'm clearly disappointed in our weaker than expected top line results, the fundamentals of our business are robust and I am confident that we have the right strategy and technologies to address the market transitions to all-flash arrays, Private Cloud, and Cloud Data Services. ","We have a strong business model as a result of the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and cost structure over the last several years. This enables us to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and make the strategic moves that position us well to return to growth. ","We have further analyzed the dynamics of what happened in the first quarter and they confirm that we are seeing a combination of slowdown related to overall macro conditions and company-specific, go-to-market execution issues. We continue to see pressure on deal sizes, longer sales cycles, and deferral of transactions. But as I noted on our earlier call, our underperformance is not across the Board. Our APAC, Europe, and U.S. Public Sector geographies were mostly on track. ","Even in the areas where we experienced the greatest weakness, top global accounts and the Americas, there were pockets of strength and high performing teams. We have been very successful with some of our global accounts, but we need to expand our wallet share in others. We have deep relationships with too few of these customers, which increases our susceptibility to a slowdown in spending related to the macro. ","In the Americas roughly 40% of our districts were successful in acquiring new customers, reaching new buyers within existing customers and effectively selling our entire portfolio, and as a result grew year-over-year. ","Performance across districts is inconsistent. Our sales leadership and I are committed to improving our sales execution through necessary leadership changes, better inspection, and discipline, expanded account coverage, acquisition and portfolio selling. ","Let me underscore the fact that we do not believe that the revenue shortfall was related to a change in the competitive environment. Our win rates remain constant and our product gross margins remain strong. In short, we need to replicate our proven areas of success by getting in front of more buyers with our full portfolio. ","To better capitalize on our opportunity, we will expand our sales capacity without increasing total operating expenses, by continuing to make disciplined tradeoffs in our spending priorities. To that end, I will now provide more detail on the specific steps we are taking. ","First, we plan to add approximately 200 primary sales resources in the next 12 months with a focus in the Americas. We will do this without increasing the total operating expenses for the company. The new sales headcount will focus on acquiring new accounts as well as engaging new buyers and finding new opportunities in existing accounts. ","Second, we will sharpen the focus of our all-flash, go-to-market, including marketing sales and services to emphasize our strong value proposition in mission critical environments where customers continue to prioritize spending. We expect that this, combined with additional sales capacity will return us to a position of growth in the all-flash market. ","Third, now that our services are generally available in Azure and will soon be in Google, we expect to see an acceleration of Cloud Data Services revenue as their sales teams ramp in selling our service. We continue to focus on expanding the range of use cases and deployment scenarios and enabling the various pathways to market to sell these services. ","And finally, we will scale our growth in the Private Cloud market through focused marketing and sales efforts. The increased sales capacity focused on reaching non-storage buyers will support this effort. We are materially stepping-up our efforts to address the appropriate buyers for our Private Cloud and Cloud Data Services offering as they are different from our traditional storage buyers.","To recap, I am confident that we can return to growth by increasing our sales capacity, adding new accounts, reaching new non-storage buyers, and selling the full portfolio. We expect that these efforts will accelerate our participation in the growing Private Cloud and Cloud Data Services markets and drive share gains. Additionally, these actions will broaden our pipeline, while lowering risks stemming from customer concentration. ","In Q1 our all-flash array business inclusive of All-Flash FAS, EF, and SolidFire products and services declined 24% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run-rate of $1.7 billion. This comparison includes a significant amount of ELA revenue related to all-flash in Q1 a year ago, that did not repeat in Q1 this year. ","While I'm disappointed by the performance of this part of the business, I remain confident in our competitive positioning and our opportunity for continued success. We have industry leading, guaranteed storage efficiency, the highest performance and the most complete Cloud integration in the market today. And the actions we are taking to increase sales coverage and target mission critical workloads will help return our all-flash business to growth. ","Moving to our Private Cloud Solutions, SolidFire NetApp HCI and Storage Grid are the building blocks for Private Cloud deployments, enabling customers to bring Public Cloud-like experience and economics into their data centers. Our Private Cloud business, inclusive of products and services, attained an annualized net revenue run rate of $250 million in the first quarter, up 85% year-over-year. ","Now on to Cloud Data Services. In Q1, we achieved general availability with Microsoft, with Azure NetApp Files, and beta release with Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud. Based on the last month of Q1, our annualized recurring revenue for Cloud Data Services increased to approximately $61 million, up 189% year-over-year. We continue to see a healthy mix of customers new to NetApp in our Cloud Services and expect that Cloud Services will continue to enable us to reach new buyers and contribute to our acquisition of new customers. ","We are very pleased with the initial ramp of Azure NetApp Files since becoming generally available. I'll share a customer example to illustrate why we're so excited. ","We are working with a Fortune 10 company to meet its Cloud First Initiative. While delivering an equal or better experience to their on-premises environment, with all the agility benefits of the Cloud. The customer began testing Azure NetApp Files while it was in preview and now that it\u2019s generally available, they've established a footprint of almost two petabytes and are growing by a 100 terabyte per week.","While some of this data will migrate from existing NetApp Systems, roughly two-thirds of the data they will move to Azure NetApp files, currently resides on Competitor Storage Systems. Our sales team partnered closely with the Azure team to leverage our expertise to help the customer establish a data strategy in the Cloud. ","By working directly with the customers Cloud leadership, we have moved from being merely an infrastructure provider with a minority position in the customer's data center, to a key strategic partner. This is a great example on not only how our Cloud Strategy helps us expand our opportunity by displacing competitive footprint, but how also reaching new buyers; in this case the Cloud team contributes to our growth. As I have described many times, customers and partners are choosing NetApp because of our data fabric strategy and our unique relationships with the hyperscale Cloud providers.","Before closing, I would like to acknowledge and thank some longtime NetAppers who are moving on for their contributions to our company. Tom Mendoza, Vice Chairman; Joel Reich, EVP Storage Systems and Software Business Unit; and Thomas Stanley, Senior VP of the Americas; we wish them all well. ","As we align to execute and thrive in a highly dynamic environment, change is inevitable. To that end, I'd like to recognize two key promotions; Brad Anderson to EVP and GM, overseeing both our Cloud Infrastructure and Storage Systems and Software Business Units; and Scott Allen to Chief Accounting Officer. I would also like to welcome Sanjay Rohatgi, Senior VP and GM of Asia Pacific. I look forward to their contributions in the continuing evolution of NetApp.","I am confident in our strategy and the fundamentals of our business model. Our continued strong cash generation is a great example of the underlying health of our business. We remain committed to our capital allocation policy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and the recently increased quarterly dividend. ","We will remain fiscally disciplined with our expenditures, while still investing for the long term health of our business. We consistently receive positive feedback from our customers and partners on the value of our data fabric strategy and the strong performance of our best teams demonstrates our ability to capitalize on the strength. ","We are confident that we can return to growth by replicating their success in reaching more customers and buying centers with our full portfolio. We will keep you updated on the progress of these initiatives on future calls. ","I'll now turn the call over to Ron. Ron?","Ron Pasek","Thanks, George. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. To reiterate George's sentiment, we are clearly disappointed with the Q1 results and are committed to addressing the challenges we faced during the quarter. ","Despite the magnitude of our Q1 revenue shortfall, the gross margin and cost structure improvements we've made over the last three years provide support for our free cash flow generation. As a result, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy of returning cast to shareholders to share buybacks and our recently increased quarterly dividend. ","Before discussing our guidance, I'll provide further detail on our Q1 performance. In Q1, net revenues of $1.236 billion were down 16% year-over-year, including over 1 point of currency headwind. Product revenue of $644 million decreased approximately 26% year-over-year. As a reminder, the Q1 \u201819 compare includes $90 million of ELA revenues which did not repeat this quarter. Adjusting for ELAs Q1 revenue would have been down approximately 11% and product revenues would have been down approximately 18%. ","Moving down the P&L, software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $523 million decreased 1% year-over-year and was flat when adjusting for currency. Deferred revenue which was up 8% year-over-year in Q1 continues to be a strong indicator of the health of our installed base. ","As we mentioned on the Q4 call, and to provide greater insight into the dynamics of our business, we have updated our strategic and mature product view. Strategic product revenue includes add-on software, Private Cloud Solutions, and all products related to all-flash arrays. Mature product revenue now includes OEM and all products related to disk and hybrid arrays. A historical recast of the strategic mature break-out can be found on our website. As a reminder, Cloud Data Services revenue is included in software and maintenance. ","Gross margin of 67.2% was above the high end of our guidance range and includes approximately a 0.5 point of currency headwind. Product gross margin was 53.4%, which is an increase of 2.8 points year-over-year when adjusting for ELAs. ","The increase was driven by sales force discipline and cost reduction and includes nearly a point of currency headwinds. Q1 was the 10th straight quarter we increased product margins year-over-year when adjusting for the benefit of ELAs. ","The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 82.1% increased by 50 basis points year-over-year. Q1 operating expenses of $652 million were flat year-over-year, operating margin was 14.4%. ","EPS of $0.65 was above the preliminary estimate we provided on our August 1 call, but below our original guidance range. We closed Q1 with $3.5 billion in cash and short term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a negative 10 days, up 10 days year-over-year. DSO of 40 days was up two days year-over-year and down 30 days sequentially. The under performance in revenue in the quarter drove DIO to 25 days, an 8 day increase year-over-year. ","We expect our cash conversion cycle to remain negative throughout fiscal 2020. Despite the revenue shortfall in the quarter, cash flow from operations was $310 million. Free cash flow of $278 million represented 22% of revenues and was up approximate 6% year-over-year. ","During Q1 we repurchased 3.9 million shares at an average price of $64.87 for a total of $250 million, which is consistent with our planned run rate heading into fiscal 2020. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $243 million, down $26 million year-over-year representing a 10% decrease. During the quarter we paid out $115 million in cash dividends. In total we returned $365 million to shareholders representing 131% of free cash flow generated in the quarter. Our fiscal Q2 cash dividend is $0.48 per share. ","Now on to guidance. As we discussed on our August 1 call, we expect revenues for fiscal 2020 to be down between 5% and 10% year-over-year. We continue to expect sequential growth within the year to be consistent with our normal seasonal patterns, except for the volatility introduced by ELAs. For fiscal 2020 we now expect gross margin to be in the range of 66% to 67%, above our previous guidance range of 64% to 65%, due primarily to the mix shift towards higher margin maintenance revenues as a result of the weakness in product sales. ","Operating margin for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 19% to 22%. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that operating expenses will be flat to slightly down year-over-year in fiscal 2020. ","As George highlighted, we expect at add 200 headcount to our sales coverage model over the next 12 months. As a result of the current revenue guidance, we expect EPS to be down between 2% and 15% year-over-year without the benefit of buy backs. ","Given the relative weakness of America's business in Q1, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18% to 19% in fiscal 2020. Additionally we expect to continue to generate meaningful free cash flow in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues. ","Now onto Q2 guidance. We expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.325 billion and $1.475 billion, which at the midpoint implies an 8% decline in revenues year-over-year, including over a point of currency headwind. ","For Q2 we expect consolidated gross margin to be approximate 66% and operating margin to be between 18% and 19%. We expect earnings per share for the second quarter to range between $0.91 and $0.99 per share. ","We are diligently focused on improved execution and addressing the challenges we face. We are committed to returning the company to grow as we implement the action plan George outlined, and we remain confident our business model leverage will enable us to deliver long term shareholder returns.","With that, I'll turn it back to Kris s to open the call for Q&A. Kris. ","Kris Newton","We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from a line of Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Your line is open. ","Nehal Chokshi","Thank you. You probably covered this in the script, but your guidance does call for a significant improvement in the year-of-year revenue growth profile, and I appreciate all the detail on what you are doing to address the shortfall. Is it true to say that these things that you're doing, you expect to actually results in that improvement this quickly? ","Ron Pasek","If you look at our Q2 seasonality, there are sort of two or three elements that come into play. The first is Q2 is typically a strong quarter for our U.S. public sector business. The second is, Cloud Data Services and our Private Cloud business should continue to perform in a normal seasonal acceleration model, and then the third is that we have factored in and probability weighted a little impact from ELAs in Q2. As you might note from the call script, we did not see any ELAs in Q1. ","Nehal Chokshi","Understood. Okay, and then the deferred revenue continues to trend up year-over-year despite the significant year-over-year product revenue decline, below even the July 2015 and July 2016 levels. Is it safe to say that this is a reflection of an increase in attachment of software and services per dollar of installed base? ","George Kurian","So, it's a function of several things, that's one. It's also a function of we're doing a little better job on renewals and point of sales. The point of sales rate for services held steady. So, you know, it\u2019s a focus area and has been for a while, we told you that, and we're doing a little better in it. ","Nehal Chokshi","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Kris Newton ","Thanks Nehal. Next question? ","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. ","Rod Hall","Yeah, thanks for the question guys. I wanted to start off I guess with the AFA weakness you called out George and fee of \u2013 yet, it looks like I mean if we back that out, the hybrid trajectory was okay. I mean things seem more stable there, so I wonder if you could just drill into that in a little bit more detail, what you see going on there. Is it the factor of this macro weakness or are you seeing people backing off of AFA investment, but keeping up with hybrid. ","And then I wanted to just double-check this as a housekeeping measure. You are guiding with ELAs in the guide this quarter. Just wanted to check that, because I thought previously you guys had decided not to guide ELAs anymore. So thanks. ","Ron Pasek","So Ron, so it\u2019s factored in with a probability. So there's some in there, we factored it down a little bit, just in case, so \u2013 and there was some in there last year, so that\u2019s a fair compare. But we didn\u2019t put it in at the full value. ","George Kurian","With regard to the mix of AFA\u2019s and hybrid, you know if you recall last year we had two elements that drove the AFA business. The first was we had several large global customers that purchased a lot of AFAs, and as we noted on our call, those customers are most impacted by the spending slowdown in the hardware. ","The second was that we also had about $90 million of ELAs last year, and a good chunk of that was attributed to all-flash purchases. So those two one-time items, on the compare was what drove the AFA number down substantially more than HFA. I would not say that there was any pattern of customers not choosing AFAs as opposed to HFAs in the broad demand environment. ","Rod Hall","Okay, great. Thank you, George. ","Kris Newton ","Thanks Rod. Next question? ","Operator","Next question comes from Matt Cabral of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Matt Cabral ","Thank you. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what's driving the uptick in gross margin guidance for the year, and in particular just how we should think about the trajectory of product margins against just the potential for a pickup in the competitive environment if some of the slower deal environment lingers a little bit. ","Ron Pasek","Yes, so there is a couple of factors. The biggest one is, obviously, you can see that in the quarter as well. You know the product revenue was down year-over-year. So, as a result, the services margin which is higher than product weighs higher on the overall margin and pushes the overall margin up. ","Having said that, we\u2019ve told you for the last several years we're working on improving gross margins. We've had 10 consecutive quarters of gross margin improvement on the product margin side and that should continue throughout the year a little bit, both from a pricing standpoint and then some costs as well. ","George Kurian","I want to call out the good work done by our sales teams on maintaining discipline. I know that, you know there are some people who think that there's a tradeoff between revenue and margin. I think our teams have remained disciplined around the pricing environment. The strong gross margin indicates our competitive differentiation, and we have not walked away from revenue due to concerns about gross margin. We have strategically used gross margin and our business model as an opportunity where we felt like it warranted it. ","Matt Cabral ","Thank you.","Kris Newton ","Thanks Matt. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open. ","Mehdi Hosseini ","Yes, thanks for taking my question. George, going back to your comment on AFA. It seems to me that even if I were to exclude the ELA from FY \u201919 the overall AFA revenue could be down in the high teen, FY \u201920 versus FY \u201919, is that a fare assumption? ","George Kurian","It is down a good amount. I think it is primarily due to you know our exposure from being very broadly deployed in big global strategic accounts that did not have as robust a spending pattern this year. The AFA business is the dominant business that we have in the big global customers and they were the most impacted by some of the uncertainty that we saw with regard to macro. ","Kris Newton ","Thank you, Mehdi. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. ","Andrew Nowinski","Great, thank you. I just had a question on your OEM business. Last quarter you talked about moving away from some OEM partners and focusing more, on more strategic partners such as Lenovo. I think the OEM revenues included in the mature segments. I was wondering is that $307 million you did in mature this quarter in-line with what you're expecting or did you also see weakness at your OEM partners? Thanks. ","Ron Pasek","We saw a little bit of weakness, and as you know it can be fairly lumpy, it's hard to predict often times what OEM customers are going to buy. We feel comfortable with the outlook for the year for OEM, which as we told you last quarter is probably not as robust and we are accepting that, but again we didn\u2019t see a robust quarter this quarter, we do expect to make the year as planned. ","George Kurian","OEM is a small percentage of the mature category. It\u2019s frankly the smallest percentage of the matured category. We are driving focus on Lenovo and it'll take some time for that business to wrap. Once it ramps, it will stabilize the OEM revenue. ","Andrew Nowinski","Alright, thanks. ","Kris Newton ","Thanks Andy. Next question? ","Operator","Next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Katy Huberty","Yes, thank you. George you talked about why your Flash business in particular is down double digits this quarter given that the large enterprise exposure. What do you think the market for flash storage did in the quarter, the market also declining? And then can you talk about how long it will take for the 200 new hires to reach their full sales quota and what would be the funding source of those given you don't expect to grow OpEx? Thanks. ","George Kurian","I couldn't comment yet on the overall Flash market Katy. I think that our view is that as NAND prices remain low, you know Flash is compellingly better technology than disc for a broad range of you know transactional applications and so as a percentage of a mix, it should benefit from the fact that NAND prices are lower. ","In terms of the head count that \u2013 so we are going to have to wait to see what other people report and sort of an overall market wrap-up to comment about Flash. We think that in our case the concentration of our largest customers, also being our largest Flash customers drove the sort of change in our Flash business. ","With regard to the investment we're making in sales and primary demand creation headcount, they are not all discreet quarter bearing headcount; there are some technical sales headcount as well. We are going to do that over 12 months. I think you will see a ramp through that period as we get operationally ready and deploy the sales headcount and so you should quarterize 200 over four quarters and it typically takes us about three to four quarters to get them fully productive after they are onboard. ","Katy Huberty","Thank you. ","George Kurian","With regard to what tradeoffs we're going to make, listen we've done a good job making tradeoffs over the last several years. You can see that in our, you know our operating margins and gross margins and will continue to make the appropriate choice of to prioritize our investments into the biggest opportunities. ","We think we have a really good portfolio and we think that based on the results we're seeing with our best team, we can deploy more headcount and capture more of the market footprint and so we're going to stay disciplined around that. ","George Kurian","Thanks Katy. Next question? ","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore IS. Your line is open. ","Amit Daryanani ","Thanks a lot guys. I guess George, I was hoping to talk a little bit about how do you see the cloud services business ramping up through the fiscal year and you were clearly positive I think on how the Azure ramp has gone, especially for the GA. I was wondering, how would you contrast the Google process as you go forward and how do you think that would be comparable or different, what\u2019s going to happen with Azure, especially given the fact Google I think bought something comparable in Elastifile recently.","A - George Kurian","First of all, we are very pleased with the progress of our product services business. It\u2019s up 189% year-over-year and I think the range of things that we see, the differentiation of our technology, the ability to you know migrate big customer workloads in a really cost effective manner to the public cloud and to be able to display its competitive footprint, they are all showing up. ","I think with regard to the plan of what we're executing too, it is to qualify more workload and to get deployed into more data centers, that gives us a broader footprint of opportunity to go after. To train the sales force, both the Microsoft sales force and the NetApp sales force around you know selling these technologies in joint ways and that'll take time you know. These are big teams and it takes us time to get all of them trained. So you should expect a ramp through the course of the year getting stronger each quarter as more people are enabled. ","With regard to Google, you know we think that we have as good an opportunity to migrate customer workloads to the Google cloud. Elastifile is not a competitive product to what we have. It's a commodity offering to compete with the low end file storage service; it's not an enterprise grade file storage service, and so we feel that our opportunity is undiminished. ","We are in beta and we are focused on the next step, which is to get the general availability. So far what we see is you know similar pattern of customer trials, testing and so on and so we've done operational readiness with one cloud provider, we're going to work on the second and then as we get to GA we\u2019ll give you more details about it. ","Amit Daryanani ","Perfect! Thanks for the insight. ","A - George Kurian","Thanks to Amit. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open. ","Steven Fox ","Thanks. Good afternoon and thanks for all the color on the quarter. I'm just struggling a little bit with the assumption that some of the macro weakness is fairly compartmentalized around the large EOMs. Is there any other points or conversations you can point to rather that would say that you don't see further weakness in some smaller customers in Europe and the U.S. Going forward I\u2019m just curious, the confidence level in the macro at this point. Thanks. ","A - George Kurian","I think that you know our perspective on the macro is very similar to what is reflected in the public commentary on the markets. We saw weakness in certain parts of Europe where GDP growth is challenged. For example, in Germany a little bit and in the UK where the you know sort of ongoing dialogue on Brexit is causing temporary pauses in spending, and then we saw it in the global customers who we do a lot of business with, right. ","I think we did not say that the enterprises that were at the next year down weren't exposed to the macro. It's our exposure to a particular customer is a lot lower when they are smaller and we have a diverse book of business in the smaller and mid-sized customers than in the giant global customers. So I would tell you that what we experienced was the combination of macro and the big relationships that we have with some of these large global accounts. ","Steven Fox ","That's helpful. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Thanks Steve. Next question? ","Operator","Next question comes from Lou Miscioscia of Daiwa Capital Market. Your line is open. ","Lou Miscioscia ","Okay, thank you. I guess George, if you could give us a view as to how I guess you viewed the sales operation since when you came in. I think that if we go back to 2015 when you first started, one of the options I think your predecessors had talked about was materially increasing the sales force, because he viewed that as that would fix some of the problems. ","And I guess the question I have and a bit of the difficulty I have is here we are ex number of years later. I realize the macro is very weak, so can fully understand that, but you would think that the sales force would be at a run rate level now, after all these years, that you know you wouldn\u2019t have to go out and either a) increase it and I'm not saying that that's wrong, but also b) that there\u2019s a high level of ones that you talked about in the last call that were not the appropriate productive level. I think we would be at a pretty good steady state. ","So if you could just help us understand that and maybe also a milestone or a number. You\u2019re adding 200. I mean how big is the sales force, at least maybe that will help us understand that statistically maybe why there's a couple of issues here, thank you. ","A - George Kurian","I think first of all you know with regard to the work that we've done in the field organization, as we have said, we have transformed many, many elements of the field organization, particularly by implementing a coverage model that allows us to prioritize our resources against the biggest accounts and the biggest opportunities. ","We started the implementation of coverage against the big global account in a more systematic way two to three years ago, which is what drove the results that we had alongside the big global accounts. We don't cover 100% of the largest 2000 to 3000 accounts in the world and we believe given the results that we\u2019ve had, that we have the opportunity by expanding coverage to a broader set of accounts that we can grow our business. ","We have also implemented new selling motions right, like covering certain markets through the channel. You saw us restructuring parts of our European organization, so that we could afford the investments in covering the bigger accounts in the bigger countries by moving some of our countries, approximately 15 of them to be served through the channel. We have constructed a joint venture in China together with Lenovo, so that he could participate in the China market in a more efficient fashion. ","So we've done a lot of things to change the structure and the composition of the sales force. We think that by adding you know a combination of resources to go after the market, approximately 8% to 10% increase in coverage, we should be able to continue to grow our business in the top line, which is the fundamental issue we've had. ","You know if you look at the rest of the P&L, we've had an exceptionally strong result across gross margin, operating margin and all of the other elements of cash generation, and we think that this is specifically a top line issue. We think that by broadening our coverage and footprint, we should be able to mitigate the impact of the macro on a few large customers that today we are exposed to. ","Lou Miscioscia ","Okay, thank you.","A - George Kurian","Thanks Lou. Next question? ","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Long of Barclays. Your line is open. ","Tim Long ","Thank you. If I could just ask kind of a two-parter here on visibility. Obviously what happens last quarter took us a little bit by surprise. Can you just talk a little bit about you know this full year view and how you feel about the second half and did you do some factoring of kind of pipeline like you did for the ELAs in the quarter. ","And then just Ron, if you could remind me the visibility into the installed base. I guess that the deferred rose, but we did have you know a decline in a few of the revenue lines, the product services and hardware maintenance. So if you could just flush out for us that installed base view, that would be great. Thank you. ","Ron Pasek","Okay, so let me start with that one. So you know when you look at maintenance you've got to kind of combine the software maintenance and hardware maintenance together, because we have changed the values associated with each over a period of time, certainly as it relates to the newly installed base. ","When you add them together they are down 1% year-over-year and when you adjust for FX they are flat. The fact of the matter is we are growing our installed base of systems under contract and have been for really, for the last eight quarters. So it's actually very healthy what you see reflected for the revenue number. ","George Kurian","With regard to our outlook for the rest of the year, you know we are not expecting rapid resolution of either the macro or some of the uncertainty around trade and so we factored in a fairly conservative profile and outlook in the overall picture. Either it\u2019s reflective of typical linearity based on a very slow start in Q1 or you know it includes some of the fact that our second half has an easier compare compared to our first half of this year, and so we are not expecting some miraculous rebound in terms of the macro environment. ","I think with regard to ELAs, you know as we said ELAs comprise about 2% of the revenue in the year. We don't break it out on a per quarter basis. You should factor in some sort of run rate for ELAs within our broader guidance. ","Ron Pasek","Just to add to that Tim, remember we have no ELAs in Q1, limited in Q2, so most of the ELAs will happen in the second half, actually it helps with the second half. ","Tim Long ","Okay. Thank you. ","Kris Newton ","Thanks Tim. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is open. ","Jim Suva","Thanks very much, Ron and George. A quick question for each of you. Ron you just mentioned limited ELAs next quarter and then more in the second half if I heard that correctly, and when you say more in the second half, do we think then about an annual run rate that you've been talking off, or how should we think about the ELAs in the second half. ","And then George if you could help us understand, adding 200 sales people in America, that's very good and a couple of quarters to ramp, but I think I heard you say no additional expenses. So how does that work out? Is that just a reallocation or how do you work out more people with no additional costs? ","Ron Pasek","Yeah, so just on the ELAs, you know I won\u2019t give you the number in Q2 but it\u2019s not huge. Obviously I factored it down, which means that mostly the ELAs will be in the second half. Again to George\u2019s point, we told you that ELAs are roughly 2% of total revenue. So you should expect the majority of that in the second half of the year. ","George Kurian","With regard to the sales capacity, as I said you know they are not all primary quarter bearing headcount. The majority of the 200 should be quarter bearing headcount, but it\u2019s a combination of frontline quarterbacking headcount, technical resources and management. ","We are going to deploy them in a graded fashion over four quarters and you should expect a ramp through those quarters as we get the operational momentum of hiring and all of that in place. It takes three to four quarters as we\u2019ve said consistently for a sales rep to get productive, right and some of these are going to be focused on selling our Private Cloud and Public Cloud portfolios, which have a different business model or profile than a traditional storage system. ","With regard to how do we expect to hire 200 people and not impact you know operating expensive, I\u2019ll just say we have north of 10,500 people on the company payroll and so we\u2019ll make the appropriate tradeoffs across our broader employee population as we think about people leave the company and you know the shape of people we hire will ship it towards the sales organization, so that we can you know accelerate the turnaround.","Jim Suva","Great, thank you so much for the details and clarifications. That\u2019s great, we appreciated it. ","George Kurian","Thank you, Jim. ","Kris Newton ","Thank you, Jim. Next question? ","Operator","The next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Our line is open. ","Aaron Rakers","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to Amit's question earlier on the Cloud Data Services business. First of all, just a kind of clarification. You know relatively to what you said on the pre-announcement and now today, are you endorsing the fact that you still believe you'll be at that 400-plus million run rate exiting fiscal 21. ","And then kind of building on that, one of the comments in the prepared remarks that you know CDS is ramping and there are some elements of cannibalization to the traditional business. I'm trying to understand how you think about that. You know should we consider that as CDS ramps there there's going to be some cannibalization of the traditional on premise business for you guys. Just get any kind of clarification or help on that would be useful. ","George Kurian","First of all I think we are pleased, with the momentum that we have in the CDS business. We still have the plan to be in the $400 billion to $600 million annual recurring run rate exiting Q4 of fiscal 21, and we are executing to that plan. There's a lot of work that goes into that, but having a leading hyper scalar like Microsoft now generally available is a good benchmark and the next benchmark is to scale them and to get Google Cloud Platform to general availability. So our heads down on executing our game plan. ","I think with regard to the base of customer adoption, we feel very good about the early results, right and I think that you should see that ramp through the course of the year. ","With regard to cannibalization, I would just tell you that you know the fact that NetApp technology is available in the Microsoft Cloud or the Google Cloud, doesn't necessarily mean that the customer is going to move the NetApp workloads first to the cloud. They have a pattern of workloads they want to move to the cloud, we get to participate in a much broader opportunity, as a result of having our technology now being the enterprise platform for both Microsoft and Google, at the expense of our competition, right. That loses every dollar that moves to the cloud, they're going to get zero. We get to participate in two of the biggest hyper-scalers now capturing those workloads onto our platform.","Does it on the margin cause some cannibalization? That's already factored into the on-premise business versus the public cloud business forecasts that people have. We just now get to participate in a much more meaningful way in the public cloud business than anybody else. And in some ways that is also helping us now, with new footprint on-premises as customers and now say,\u201d listen, I discovered NetApp in the public cloud. I want to give them a bigger footprint on-prem.\u201d","Aaron Rakers","Very helpful, thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks Aaron. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah","Good afternoon, I appreciate you taking the questions. Yeah, just going back to AFA, I guess just a two-part for both George and Ron if I could. We'd love to get a sense of, if you're seeing incremental pricing pressure over the last couple of quarters in AFA, even if it's from the customers as the deal sizes have shrunk a bit? And then just sticking with AFA, I'd love to get a sense of if you think that macro aside just industry penetration, the velocity of industry penetration has been slowing at all and your thoughts around that. Thanks a lot.","George Kurian","You know, I'll tell you what we saw with our AFA business is that customers bought more of the mid-range configurations and you know bought the capacity that they needed for the next year rather than rightsizing the equipment for a three-year outlook, right? And that is, you know what I would do if I were faced with an uncertain budget environment, so we did see that fairly systematically. ","I think with regard to AFA versus the overall storage market, I think that the economics of AFAs compared to hybrid continues to grow and get better, right? If you look at NAND prices, they continue to make AFA a much more attractive value proposition than they were in the past, every quarter, and so if I were a customer, I would continue to prioritize AFA for all by transactional applications. The overall landscape for storage is dependent on the macro, and so I don't see the mix changing. I just look at the overall water level being determined by the macro.","Ananda Baruah","Okay, got it. That's helpful. I appreciate the context. Thanks.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Ananda. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street. Your line is open.","Eric Martinuzzi","Yeah, I just wanted to clarify, a couple of weeks ago you talked about the shortfall being about two-thirds macro, one-third NetApp-specific. I wanted to make sure that was, you still felt that was the case after a couple of weeks of analysis? And then second part of the question has to do with, you've turned over your EVP, Americas. Wondering if there is any turnover below that senior level, because obviously that would make the adding to the sales more of a back-end loaded 2020 effort. I would think that that might slow things down on the sales hiring.","George Kurian","Listen, I think that our analysis leads us to draw the same conclusion, which is its two-third macro, one-third, yes we could have executed better. We did see some exposure from our \u2013 being concentrated in some of the larger accounts, right, and I think that that's consistent. ","I want to just say that our leadership team, we wish all of the members of our leadership team well. We have the need to continue to add capacity. That's the fundamental area of focus for us. We'll continue to inspect our business and we'll provide you updates on our execution improvements over time. I'll just leave it there.","Eric Martinuzzi","But were there second level turnover, obviously there was at the EVP level, but kind of one level down from that?","George Kurian","No.","Eric Martinuzzi","Okay, thank you.","Kris Newton","Thanks, Eric. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes for Andrew Vadheim of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Andrew Vadheim","Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the full-year outlook and what role macro plays. So if you look at 1Q regarding the geographic breakdown of your revs, focusing on EMEA and APAC, 1Q numbers were pretty close to our expectations. And if you link the geographic split back to your full year guide, are you embedding sort of a flat or slightly down EMEA, and APAC for the year. And then uncertainty in Americas gets you to down 10 at the low end to down five at the high-end or does the bottom\/top of the range embed a bull-bear case for EMEA and APAC?","Ron Pasek","You know I'd rather not go into some of the specific assumptions we made by geo. I think we did look at several things. We looked at what we're seeing in the macro environment in each of those geographies, we talked at the local sales leadership etcetera. ","We are making judgments overall, so I can't tell you the exact trade-offs we made, but we are looking at a downsize down 10% for the year. So obviously you'll see that probably most profoundly down in the Americas, kind of given where we are, but beyond that I'm not going to give any other detail.","George Kurian","I'll just say I think all of the calculations and factors we considered are you know in the public domain, right, and we use those factors to determine broad-based economic trajectories and then combine that with the judgment and the pipeline data of our sales teams and the historical linearity pattern of our business.","Kris Newton","Alright, thank you Andrew. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Nick Todorov of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Nick Todorov","Hi, thanks for taking the question. You guys talked about customer concentration a couple of times today. Can you give us a little bit more color, maybe an example of how much revenue you\u2019re top 10 or 15 customers account for?","George Kurian","We are not going to break that out. I would just say that the impact of what happened during the quarter was primarily due to the fact that some of our largest global accounts that we have very strategic relationships with, you know did not spend anywhere close to what they spent last year.","I'll give you an example. We had two large customers that are exposed to the China tariff situation that have cut their capital spending by north of 30% year-on-year. Clearly we are a part of that spending profile and so I would just say that we have really good relationships with the big set of customers and we are planning to broaden those relationships to another broader set of customers over the course of the next year to 18 months.","Nick Todorov","Okay. And can I squeeze one more in? Can you remind us how much you have remaining on your buyback authorization? And that'll be from me. Thanks.","Ron Pasek","We have $1.6 billion left on the authorization.","Nick Todorov","Okay, thanks guys. Good luck.","Kris Newton","Thanks Nick. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Simon Leopold","Thank you. During the prepared remarks, you did indicate that you're not seeing any change in the competitive environment. I just wanted to maybe get a better understanding of whether or not we might see the market share shifts as measured by the third party that might reflect differences in geographies or differences in terms of footprint where maybe a competitor might be upgrading its legacy footprint and you've completed that task. Just trying to get a little bit of a better understanding of how you can be confident that it's not about competition and how to square this with third-party research? Thank you.","George Kurian","I think that you know what we mean when we say it's not a competitive factor is that our win rates in competitive transactions remains the same. Our product gross margins were up 280 basis points year-on-year when you adjust for ELAs, which shows the strength of our differentiation, right? ","I think there may be differences in how the results play out for different providers depending on their customer basis. We did see exposure from our biggest customers not buying as much, right? And I think that what we are convinced off is that if we expand our footprint and broaden our customer coverage, given the strength of the performance we've had in the places where we saw you know budget available and our ability to win competitive transactions, we should be able to broaden our book of business and reduce the effects of customer concentration.","Simon Leopold","Thank you for the clarification.","Kris Newton","Thank you, Simon. Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes, I have two follow-ups. Ron, if I were just to look at your guide for the October quarter operating margin, it seems to me that OpEx would actually go up by $10 million to $15 million. Is that a fair assumption?","Ron Pasek","Yeah, I mean, it goes up as a function of revenue, sure.","Mehdi Hosseini","Okay, so just going back to the comment of adding additional sales people, this OpEx is just nature of the revenue and nothing to do with the recent months.","Ron Pasek","Yes. You won't see a huge impact to OpEx in the quarter for the hiring, it takes a while to get people onboard. You'll see some increase is baked in there, but most of that's just a function of the linearity throughout the year, linear revenues and the headcount structure. So. ","Mehdi Hosseini","Sure. I just have a quick follow-up to the AFA question I asked earlier. Your comments suggested there is a high-teen decline in AFA revenue, FY'20 versus FY '19. But as I look at the back half of this FY\u201920, I see a nice rebound driven by the migration of the 10 K-RPM to SSD, and that should build momentum into calendar year \u2013 into the fiscal year '21. Is that a fair assumption as to what could drive a rebound in AFA?","George Kurian","I think first of all, what we said was it was reflective of Q1 results, Q1 FY '20 over Q1 FY '19 being down in the high teens, right? ","I think with regard to the rest of the year, I'm not going to break out AFA versus HFA. I think that AFA is advantaged on a whole bunch of dimensions and should continue to get a bigger share of the pie of storage relative to HFA than it was in prior years, just because of NAND economics, QLC, all kinds of things. ","I think we will continue to use every opportunity we can to drive transitions of disk-based systems and hybrid-based systems to our flash systems. The pace of those upgrades is a combination of, yes, good technology being available, but also budget cycles being available. ","And so we're going to lean in on the technology side and give customers every opportunity to upgrade. But we'll have to wait to see how the macro plays out, to see how many of those budget cycles are available.","Mehdi Hosseini","Got it. Thank you.","Kris Newton","Thank you. Mehdi. I'll now pass it back to George for a couple of closing comments.","George Kurian","Thanks, Kris. I'm disappointed in our weaker than expected top line results, but I remain confident that we have the right strategy and technology to address the key market transition. We have a strong business model, as a result of the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and cost structure over the last several years. ","Our continued strong cash generation is a great example of the underlying health of our business. We will remain fiscally disciplined with our expenditures, while still investing for the long-term health of the business, and we remain committed to our capital allocation policy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and a quarterly dividend. The robust fundamentals of our business enable us to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and make the strategic moves that position us to return to growth.

My name is Ellen, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Ms. Newton, you may begin.","Kris Newton","Hello, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are our CEO, Tom Georgens; and our CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, the supplemental commentary, our financial tables and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, all of which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We describe some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on an 8-K. A detailed discussion of the reasons is included in our risk factors included in our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Q reports, also on file with the SEC and available on our website, all of which are incorporated by reference in today's discussion.","All numbers discussed today are GAAP unless stated otherwise. To see the reconciling items between the non-GAAP and GAAP, you may refer to the table in our press release, our supplemental commentary or on our website.","In a moment, Nick will walk you through some additional color on our financial results, and then Tom will walk you through his perspective on the business for the quarter.","I'll now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Thank you, Kris. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. Q4 represented another quarter of solid financial performance by NetApp. Net revenue of $1.72 billion was inside our prior guidance range, driven by branded revenue growth. We achieved a strong non-GAAP gross margin of 61.3% and non-GAAP operating margin of 17%, underscoring our continued execution focus. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 was just under the high end of our Q4 guidance range, and we generated $392 million of free cash flow in the quarter, approximately 23% of revenue.","Starting with revenue. Q4 revenue increased 5% sequentially and 1% over Q4 last year. Q4 deferred revenue increased by $134 million from Q3. Branded revenue was up 9% from Q3 and 3% from Q4 last year, while OEM revenue declined 19% sequentially and 18% from Q4 a year ago. For fiscal year 2013, revenue of $6.33 billion increased 2% from fiscal year 2012, with branded revenue up almost 4% and OEM revenue down 12% from the prior fiscal year. For fiscal year 2013, revenue for all geographies was flat to up 1% from fiscal year 2012 with the exception of APAC, which was up 11%.","Non-GAAP gross margin of 61.3% in Q4 exceeded our previous guidance, driven by strong product gross margin. Product gross margin of 55.8% was up both sequentially and year-over-year, fueled by branded revenue growth and sales of more highly configured systems. Service gross margin of 56.2% decreased both sequentially and year-over-year due to increased investments in our service and support infrastructure, which we expect to continue as our installed base grows. For the full year, gross margin of 60.7% was about at the midpoint of our targeted financial model.","Non-GAAP operating margin of 17% in Q4 was in line with our prior guidance and down slightly from Q3. Non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2013 was down 2.5 points from fiscal 2012, impacted heavily by lower revenue and operating profit in the first half of the fiscal year. Non-GAAP other income net was down substantially from Q3, driven by higher interest expense related to our senior notes, which were issued in December.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 13.4% for Q4 and 15.1% for the fiscal year, slightly lower than prior guidance, reflecting year-end true-ups related to the full year mix of revenue and profits from our overseas and domestic business.","Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 was just under the high end of our previous guidance range. For the full year, EPS of $2.28 was down 5% from fiscal year 2012, despite the 4% reduction in average diluted share count due to lower revenue and operating profit in the first half of the year.","Our balance sheet remains healthy, ending the year with approximately $7 billion in cash and investments. Accounts receivable day sales outstanding increased to 42 days, consistent with our seasonal expectations and improved from Q4 last year. Inventory improved to 19 turns.","Cash generation continues to be a highlight, with cash from operations of $456 million in Q4 and free cash flow of $392 million, roughly 23% of revenue. Overall cash reflects the repurchase of approximately $180 million of stock in the quarter, about 3x the amount in Q3 and is consistent with the expectations we laid out on our last earnings call. Diluted share count increased in Q4 by 3.5 million shares, 3 million of which were related to the accounting for shares associated with our convertible notes. The notes are now fully convertible and will mature on June 1 with final settlement on June 3. We expect to settle the notes with $1.265 billion of U.S. cash paid to note holders, and to the extent the average share price is over the strike price of $31.85, shares of common stock associated with the conversion feature of the notes. This dilution will be partially offset by existing note hedges. And as you may recall, 80% of the convertible notes are hedged.","Separately, our related warrants will come due in Q2 fiscal 2014. The warrants may also create dilution if our share price is over $41.28 at maturity. We expect to repurchase shares to offset any remaining dilution associated with the maturity of our convertible notes as well as our warrants.","Capital allocation is a topic that we continually evaluate and was an area of particular focus over the course of fiscal year 2013, both internally and with our shareholders. At our financial Analyst Day last June, I highlighted the strong cash generation of NetApp over a 5-year period as well as the balance we have maintained in both investing in the business and returning capital to shareholders.","In fiscal year 2013, we continued to demonstrate that same balance. We invested $410 million in the business in the form of capital expenditures and technology tuck-in M&A and repurchased $590 million of our stock out of the almost $1.4 billion of cash we generated from operations. We also spent the year planning, listening to our shareholders and enhancing our capital structure through important activities such as achieving an investment-grade credit rating, completing a $1 billion debut investment-grade bond offering at historically low rates, executing a new 5-year $250 million revolving credit facility, paying off all of our remaining real estate synthetic leases and announcing our intent to retire our convertible notes at maturity in June.","We are now entering the next phase of our capital allocation process. NetApp is increasing its current stock repurchase program, of which $1.4 billion remains outstanding by an additional $1.6 billion. We intend to commence a $3 billion share repurchase program to complete over the next 3 years. We intend $2 billion of repurchases to be completed within the next 12 months, of which $1 billion is planned to be completed during the next 4 months.  I am also pleased to announce the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of the company's common stock, which we expect to increase over time.","These capital initiatives reflect our confidence in the underlying long-term strength of NetApp's business as well as our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. We have carefully structured the program to ensure full flexibility to support innovation and growth initiatives, both organic and inorganic. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions under the program and future dividends and dividend increases will depend on market conditions, corporate business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements. And as you would expect, we will provide updates on our progress each quarter.","Separately, we recently commenced a realignment exercise across the company, which we expect, upon completion, to result in the elimination of just over 900 jobs and result in a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $50 million to $60 million. We took this action to better align our resources and investments to our most strategic initiatives. While difficult, we believe these decisions position us well for the future, enabling us to achieve our business objectives, profitability and profit growth expectations.","Turning to guidance. We expect our Q1 target revenue to range between $1.475 billion to $1.575 billion, which, at the midpoint, implies an 11% sequential decline and 6% year-over-year increase in revenue. The sequential decline reflects the combination of our typical Q4 to Q1 seasonal revenue dynamics, continued reduction in OEM revenue and a bit of conservatism relative to the low-growth IT spending environment.","We expect consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 61%, almost a point of improvement from a year ago and non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 13.5% to 14%, 1 to 1.5 points better than a year ago, reflecting partial benefits to be realized from our realignment activities.","We expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to increase to approximately 18% for Q1 in fiscal year 2014 and our diluted share count for Q1 to decrease slightly to approximately 367 million shares based on our average stock price of $35.11 for the first 10 days of the quarter as well as the expected remaining impacts from the convertible notes. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q1 to range from approximately $0.45 to $0.50 per share, up 7% to 19% from operations alone versus Q1 last year.","As we look at Q1 and beyond into the rest of fiscal year 2014, I have a couple of closing thoughts to which, I'm sure, Tom will speak as well. We believe we are in a strong position to gain market share based on the power of our innovation. That said, we must be cognizant of the macro and IT spending environment and have taken carefully planned steps to ensure we have directed our investments and resources to our biggest opportunities within our targeted business model. We are reiterating the guidance given in our 2012 Analyst Day presentation, including target ranges for non-GAAP gross margin of 60% to 62% on average and non-GAAP operating margin of 17% to 19% on average for the period fiscal year 2013 to 2015. However, both measures are ultimately dependent on revenue mix and growth. For fiscal 2014 specifically, we expect gross margin at the midpoint of this range, operating margin at the low end of this range, EPS growth from operations before our capital allocation action in the mid-teens and finally, continued strong cash flow generation.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tom for his thoughts. Tom?","Thomas Georgens","Thanks, Nick, and welcome, everyone. Despite a challenging IT spending environment, NetApp performed well in Q4. Our revenue was within our guidance range, EPS was towards the high end of our range, and we increased gross margin. In the quarter, we achieved record bookings with branded bookings growing double digits year-over-year, our highest branded growth in 5 quarters. As others in tech experienced, the quarter was heavily back-end loaded and had an impact on bookings-to-revenue conversion. Nonetheless, we saw a strong customer demand in all geographies, as well as an increase in the number of deals over $1 million and a record number of deals over $5 million. As Nick pointed out, this was another branded-led quarter, with 9% sequential growth in branded revenue.","With a complex product transition behind us, we are now accelerating our pace of innovation introduced to the market. We are seeing rapid uptake of clustered ONTAP as well as our new platforms. We recently announced a family of all-flash arrays and started shipping Flash Accel, our solutions for flash on the host. We also saw a record quarter for branded E-Series products and expansion of our FlexPod solution set. NetApp has more innovative technology at the early stages of its product life cycle than at any time in our history, and we believe NetApp is better positioned than ever to take advantage of the substantial opportunities presented by the emerging customer technology trends that are transforming the industry, such as cloud, flash and converged systems.","Private cloud environments will see the greatest growth in IT spending in the near term. For private cloud deployments, IT organizations need flexible storage resources that can be deployed on a wide range of hardware and provisioned and consumed based on policy directly by the application and development teams. This concept has been coined software-defined storage. NetApp pioneered this value proposition with our Data ONTAP operating system and on-command portfolio. For the last decade, we've been able to run ONTAP on our hardware and other people's hardware through V-Series. Today, we have extended this capability into the cloud with NetApp private storage for Amazon Web Services as well as enabled ONTAP to run on commodity servers with ONTAP Edge and have the ability to bring data on server-side flash into the ONTAP management framework with Flash Accel. Through storage virtual machines, ONTAP abstracts the data access and services to provide data mobility, granular quality of service and integrated data protection for direct consumption and use within applications across a diverse set of physical storage options. Only NetApp can deliver on the promise of software-defined storage today. NetApp provides compelling value to both the enterprise private cloud and public cloud service providers with the scale, performance and nondisruptive operations of clustered Data ONTAP.","The momentum of clustered Data ONTAP has grown over the course of fiscal year '13 with a 4x increase in clustered nodes from fiscal year '12. Sales of clustered nodes in Q4 increased 95% from Q3 on top of sequential increases of almost 70%, Q2 to Q3; and 120%, Q1 to Q2. The installed base includes almost 1,000 unique customers, of which 1\/3 are repeat clustered ONTAP customers. In Q4, 18% of mid-range and high-end system shipped are running clustered ONTAP. In addition, over half of our installed base has migrated to Data ONTAP 8, the industry's most innovative storage operating system, and we will continue to enhance it. You can expect to hear more about the next version of Data ONTAP in the near future.","We strengthened our leadership position in flash with the introduction of the EF540 all-flash array and a preview of the FlashRay product family, which will deliver rich scale-out and storage efficiency features to maximize the benefits of all-flash arrays. Since the introduction of our flash program, NetApp has shipped 44 petabytes of flash and accelerated over 4 exabytes of hard disk.","Q4 saw record unit sales of Flash Cache and Flash Pool. Flash Cache is attached to 54% of mid-range and high-end systems. Approximately 11% of systems with Flash Pool are deployed in clustered environments and Q4 Flash Pool deployments grew 32% from Q3. NetApp now has the broadest portfolio of flash in the market, offering flash as a cache in the server, controller and array as well as all-flash arrays to meet extreme performance needs. The EF540, an all-flash array built on E-Series that we have discussed with you on prior calls, was introduced in Q4, and we are seeing good customer demand. Overall, our branded E-Series products, including the EF540, are performing well, with an increase of 17% in units shipped from Q3.","Also in Q4, we refreshed the FAS6000 family. FAS6000 units were up slightly from last quarter, with new-generation systems representing almost 1\/3 of total FAS6000 units shipped. FAS6000 systems running in clustered deployments also increased from last quarter, with 28% of FAS6000 shipped in Q4 running clustered ONTAP.","FAS3000 units were up 13% sequentially. New-generation systems represented almost 70% of the total FAS3000 shipments in the quarter, and FAS3000 units shipped running in clustered environments more than doubled from Q3.","FAS2000 units were down slightly on a sequential basis. Units shipped from the V-Series family, comprised of both V3000 and V6000, also increased, up 15% from last quarter.","As we have discussed over the course of fiscal year '13, partnering continues to be key to our strategy. We gained leverage in terms of sales and solutions reached by working closely with our partners. Our indirect and OEM business represented 81% of Q4 revenue, up 6% sequentially. Together, Arrow and Avnet grew 19% from Q3, contributing a record 37% of total revenue. OEM was 10% of total revenue, down both sequentially and year-over-year. Our OEM revenue is settling to the level we expected when we made the Engenio acquisition. We have some partners that are looking to rely more on their own IP, while others are looking to rely more on NetApp, and we are selectively adding new partners.","FlexPod is another excellent example of the advantage we can achieve through the depth of our partnerships. Our FlexPod business continues to grow as measured on every metric: partners, customers and sales. We expanded the partner ecosystem with the introduction of the new FlexPod solutions for Oracle and Microsoft. We've grown the FlexPod customer base almost 150% from fiscal year '12, and in Q4, we more than doubled booked business from Q4 a year ago. Most notably, clustered deployments represented 39% of our Q4 FlexPod business.","Fiscal year '13 was highlighted by progress on our key initiatives, adoption of clustered ONTAP, leadership in the flash space and leverage through our channel and alliance partners. As Nick called out, we continue to make progress towards our target financial model and maintain our strong cash-generation capability. We saw a strong branded revenue growth in the second half of the year, and gross margins were within our guidance range each quarter of fiscal year '13. The capital allocation and realignment announcements we made today are designed to simultaneously focus resources on our growth opportunities while growing earnings and shareholder value. Whether through share gain from our innovation and partnerships, leverage from our OpEx stack or capital returns to shareholders, NetApp has multiple avenues to achieve sustained, double-digit annual EPS growth.","Finally, I would like to thank the NetApp team for their passion and commitment to achieving our strategic goals. I want to acknowledge that last week was a difficult one for employees, but I remain confident in our future. We are faced with the challenge of continuing to execute against our growth strategy while achieving our business and financial objectives in the context of a low-growth IT spending environment. This requires difficult decisions that will ultimately make the company stronger. Despite the impact of last week's action, we all remain committed to creating a model company and building a unique culture that enables the success of our employees, partners and customers.","At this point, I will open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Audio Gap]","comes from Kulbinder Garcha of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My question is just kind of clarification around OpEx for Nick and Tom. Nick, did you say that this year, you expect a mid-teens earnings growth for the full fiscal year? My questions around that is the -- what do that tell us about how you're managing OpEx in the balance of the year to get that earnings growth? Is it a case of OpEx to sales coming down? Even in a low-growth IT environment, is there further cost-cutting you guys are considering? And kind of linked to that, and this is maybe for Tom, more philosophical, previously I always got the message, Tom, that you guys would be -- looked at OpEx because you had switched significant share opportunity having -- you have a 10% storage share. The #1 vendor has 30%, and there's so much land out there for you to gain. Has something changed in your thinking around that?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes. So Kulbinder, this is Nick. I'll start, and I'm sure Tom will weigh in as well. So in terms of the go-forward for the year, what we're looking at is aiming at that 17% op margin. And based upon a 61% gross margin for the year, those are the targets we're aiming at. Obviously, the first quarter is going to be a little light of that, certainly, in the operating margin side because of the sequential down from Q4 to Q1 in terms of revenue. But for the year, driving for that 17%, we're obviously conscious of the macro. We're obviously conscious of our investments, one of the reasons why we made this realignment decision, but our investments are going to the areas we think have the best opportunity. They're focused on clustered Data ONTAP. They're focused on flash, et cetera. 17% is the operating margin we are aiming at for the year. That yield -- on an operational level, that yields mid-teens EPS growth before any of the capital activities or the capital allocation activities we talked about.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I think, philosophically, in terms of the opportunity in front of us, I don't think that has changed. We went through this, an activity similar to this, several years back. And the aftermath of that, we had a 30% year-over-year organic growth year. So I don't think that taking this action now is basically signaling anything about the confidence about the future. I think it's a pragmatic point of view, and that is we're in a period where IT spending is constrained. That certainly has impact on our growth rate. We have a number of very, very key initiatives that we need to make sure that we get staffed and funded. And we need to do all of that in the context of generating shareholder return. So I think balancing all of that forces us into a situation of re-prioritizing and realigning to get our resources connected to the most important things that we have going on as a company and things that are going to sow the seeds of the future growth. So one thing I would say as we go forward, we are not frozen. In fact, we have more open reqs today than we did a month ago. So I'm looking to continue to reinvest around the priorities that we set as a company. And should we see revenue not come out the way we think or the market deteriorates further, clearly, we'll modulate that. But right now, our expectation is that we are continuing to invest around the key initiatives. And we did the restructuring to basically free up those resources for reassignment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities.","Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","So your branded revenue growth was 3%, but you said your branded bookings were up double digits. So I'm wondering, do you expect the branded revenue growth to accelerate because of that strong bookings number to the high-single-digits percentage or double digits over the next few quarters?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes, I think -- yes, one of the things about the quarter is -- on the branded side, I think we're pretty pleased with how it played out. I think we saw growth in all the deals. It was very, very broad based across all the segments. So I think we finished exceptionally strong. I think we're very, very happy with all that. Margin stayed strong along the way, so we're able to protect our value proposition in -- with respect to growth and everything back-end loaded. So one of the things that we do see is -- you saw that $130 million plus went to deferred revenue build, so some of that growth went into deferred revenue, and so it became too late in the quarter for us to convert. So while I don't want to talk about growth in terms of beyond next quarter because certainly, we're well aware of the earnings cycle and what we've heard from other players in this industry and other bellwethers about their expectations, so I think we're going to be tempered by that. And I think we have our own dynamics in Q4, where our own incentives and our own sale force perhaps overpower some of the seasonality for you to be cognizant of what we see and from the other companies out there. But that said, I think that we finished strong. I think we brought home the big deals in the end. We can see a lot of deals pushed out of the year and out of the quarter. And I think the team enters 2014 with some confidence, but I think all that is tempered by a backdrop that we're all pretty concerned about.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Marshall with ISI Group.","Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Obviously, the investment community is going to applaud the initiation of the dividend here at 170 basis points some -- and grow income, but can you walk us through sort of your methodology, your framework for determining your capital allocation? Because when you look at across M&A and share repurchases, dividend, et cetera, it looks like for the next 120 days, on average, you're going to be in the market buying 3% of the shares that trade every day. So just wanted to get a sense of the methodology behind the initial allocation.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Sure, Brian. This is Nick. So first of all, in terms of the how we do it, we'll employ a variety of means to be in the market with this first tranche that we talked about over the next 4 months. But the overall of the program is, last year, if you dial back a year and look at what I showed at the Analyst Day last year, we talked about strong cash generation and balanced deployment of cash over a period of time. And we've spent a full year looking at and working on capital allocation as a company. We've taken on the debt. We have announced that we're going to retire the convertible notes, and that's at the very beginning of June. We put a revolver in place. We cleaned up all of the off-balance sheet stuff. So there's been a lot of activity that's going on over the course of the year, that's really gotten us to this point. When we look at the end of the year and that $7 billion of cash and investments, about 50% of that is domestic. We're looking at a combination of that. We're looking at that less the converts. We're also looking at our expected cash generation over time. I mean, I'd look at the last year and say in a year with 2% revenue growth, we generated $1 billion plus of free cash flow third year in a row. So we've looked at all of those factors in coming up with this dividend and the announcement of the dividend and the repurchase program that we've put out there. And obviously, we're not only doing the buyback to offset dilution but obviously more than that. And that is all coming out of U.S. cash and what we've looked at in the past as excess U.S. cash.","Operator","The next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","My question is on the gross margin line. Obviously, you were able to attain that north of 55% targeted gross margin on product. Obviously, that was a bit offset by the services gross margin down quite a bit. Can you talk a little bit about the trajectory of the gross margin, what your assumptions are underlying that 61% target for the full year as it relates to those 2 line items?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Sure, Aaron. So first on the gross margin line, yes, I think what you're seeing in Q4 is the power of that branded revenue growth that Tom talked about flowing through on the product gross margin line. It was obviously a strong quarter with lower OEM mix, frankly, contributing as well to that. As we look forward into '14, I gave that overall view of about 61% on the gross margin side and that being the view for Q1. That would imply pretty close to the types of ranges we saw in Q4 moving forward. So that type of 54%, 55% type of range on product gross margin and a little lower than what we've seen in the past, so a 56% -- 55%, 56% types of range on service. And the service side is really about investments. And we talked about this in the past, where -- when we look at our install base, when we look at the size of our install base and the growth in our install base, we have to put the service investments in place to support that. So obviously, we make those investments ahead of the revenue coming through. So we build all of those things together in terms of really looking at that guidance and building that guidance.","Operator","The next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Federal declined double digits this quarter after good growth last quarter. Do you think there were spending delays around the sequester? And if so, would you expect some recovery in that segment over the next couple of quarters?","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I do. In fact, that's probably the area where the bookings performance and the revenue performance are the most divergent. In fact, from a bookings perspective, the federal was actually very, very strong. So I think we were quite pleased with that. So certainly, we see the sequester. Certainly, we see perhaps a debt ceiling fight yet again in our future. But nonetheless, I think we're clearly the #1 market share player in the federal space, and I think we continue to win business. So we took some nice sized ideals out of Department of Defense, sequester notwithstanding. We also opened up other opportunities. So I read the same headlines you do on the federal side, but I think that team is executing really well. And I think our federal business will be okay, in fact, better than okay as the year progresses. So I'm not expecting to see a significant reversal in that business. I think that will continue to gain share. And barring some significant disruption, I still think that will be a meaningful part of our business, both from a profit perspective and a growth perspective.","Operator","The next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just want to understand maybe a little bit on the guide for July and the fiscal '14 comments. I think the July guide, your guidance assumed share count will be flattish at about 367 million shares. But you, I think, are doing $1 billion worth of buybacks for the next 4 months. That would imply share count could be down by 5%, I think. So could you maybe just talk about that delta? And then same thing for fiscal '14, if you were able to execute the entire $2 billion buyback, that could lower your share count about 13%, 14% gross of dilution. So that mid-teens EPS comment, do we think about an additional kicker of 10% to 14% with the buybacks coming in?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Sure, Amit. So you're right, for Q1, that did not assume any incremental repurchases. So when we gave the guidance for Q1, we talked about operationally. And when we talked about mid-teens for the year, that's also operationally. So that's a mid-teens EPS growth for the year and strong EPS growth for the first quarter, all driven through operations. Anything we do on the capital side of the fence will be incremental to that, but we wanted to give you the perspective on just what the operations of the business will do before the capital side of the fence. And obviously, depending upon the timing, it will impact it and benefit it.","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I think -- overall, I think we want to separate those 2 so that becomes more clear. But as I look at the business and I look at what we're trying to do, and to go back to Nick's presentation at Financial Analyst Day about EPS growth, I think between the capital plan now extended over 3 years plus the dividend, plus the opportunity for growth and plus our managing of the OpEx stack, I think there's multiple avenues and multiple paths to get the double-digit operating income growth on a multiyear basis. So that's really what we're driving for. I think we have a lot more optionality than we had a year ago, and I feel pretty confident that we've got various different ways to deliver on that for our shareholders.","Operator","The next question comes from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo.","Maynard Joseph Um - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just had a follow-up on the U.S. cash. If I just went through the math, I'm just curious if you're planning -- if you have this sufficient U.S. cash to fund the dividends and the $1 billion remaining share repurchases, or do you expect to repatriate cash or raise more debt? Just when you run through that math, it looks like you're utilizing all of the U.S. cash and then should we assume that, given that, that M&A more broadly is off the board at least from the U.S. side?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Sure, Maynard. Let me make a few comments on that, and Tom may want to weigh in as well. If I look at that U.S. cash and that 49%, that's about $3.4 and change billion. Take the convert out of that, which is U.S. settled, which gets me down to 2  and change. Take out cash we need to run the business, we're still in $1.5 billion right there and that's before what we generate, right, which is, let's call it, 50-50. So we have excess cash. We're employing excess cash. On the debt side of the fence, that's something we may or may not do, but that's not something that is absolutely imminent and something we must do. On the repatriation side, there is no need at this point in time to repatriate funds that are overseas, that are permanently reinvested overseas. So these are 3 things that we continue to look at, but I wanted to at least walk you through the math on how we get there. And certainly, again, I'll go back to -- in a year, FY '13, with very low top line growth, we were able to -- and below business model margins, we're able to generate over $1 billion of free cash flow. So certainly, this is a business that continually -- continues to generate a lot of cash. And that is obviously something we've looked at in terms of coming up with this dividend and looking at this overall repurchase plan.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. On the M&A question, I think that one of the things that we did over the course of the year is clearly establish a debt rating for ourselves and establish much easier access to the debt markets than we have prior. So as we think about M&A activity, I don't think that our thoughts have really changed materially at all. I think that we've got optionality now not to fund M&A purely by cash on the balance sheet. We've got other ways to fund M&A, given that we've got more access to the capital markets. So I think how we play that out will depend on how we think interest rates are going to play, whether we take the cash now or how that plays out over the rest of the year. But fundamentally, I think that without tapping the debt market, we can fund both the capital repurchase plan that we just talked about and our M&A activity that we have contemplated. Or at least, certainly, our exist -- our previous run rate, and in fact, even better than our previous run rate, if necessary. So all in all, I think we are liquid enough to basically accomplish what we need to accomplish, both strategically and in terms of return to our shareholders.","Operator","The next question is from Louis Miscioscia with CLSA.","Louis R. Miscioscia - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Tom, if you look back over the last 12 months, there's a lot of things going on in the storage space, some of the areas you're actually participating in, like in flash, but then there's also cloud. There's converged systems, which that helps you with the FlexPod, but there's also storage efficiencies, object storage, and your petabytes only grew 4%. So maybe you can put all this into perspective. How much do think some of these things impacted you from a product growth standpoint in the last 12 months, and what do you see going forward with these same trends?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think first and foremost, on the capacity growth, interestingly enough, that's not a metric we follow that closely. That's really not what we're focused on as a company. I think we've been very consistent on our messaging that we're really about selling Data ONTAP. And we went through a whole 6 months of conversation about flash on the host and how selling those bits in the host in flash is not the business that we're in. We want to be the software that manages all of that. So historically, we sold V-Series, which is basically a product without a disk drive, that sells Data ONTAP and our premium software, flash in the host. That's -- the entire SDS story is based on that. So for us, we're looking for Data ONTAP footprints, and some of that footprint will be managing storage that we sell and some of it will be managing storage that we don't sell. So I think first and foremost, capacity is not necessarily a relevant question, and that's not a metric that we individually track on a weekly basis. Certainly, there are other factors at play. I think the efficiency story, particularly in difficult economic times, is encouraging customers to perhaps sweat the asset more or deploy some of the efficiency technologies, that perhaps they hadn't done in the past or perhaps they'd not felt the pressure to do so. And then likewise, I think certainly, there's certainly low utilization workloads or temporary workloads that are in the cloud. And I think that's a factor as well. So --  but I think, overall, as far as NetApp is concerned, I think footprint of Data ONTAP is key to our strategy and that's the thing that we're going to push and that's the thing that we're most interested in. So clustered ONTAP adoption -- for several of those workloads that you talked about, clustered ONTAP adoption for virtualization, for big data. We've also done some very interesting things with Amazon as an alliance partner around NetApp primary storage for AWS. And that's generated a lot of customer interest, and this quarter, the first transactions in that area. So I think from our view, I mean the big picture as we see it is, I think customers are looking for a broad enterprise-wide data management solution, which is ONTAP or clustered ONTAP. And they may have multiple different storage incarnations, whether it be flash, whether it be Amazon, whether it be commodity disk or other whether it be NetApp arrays. And our view is that we want to manage all of that. And the value proposition that we're going to drive to the enterprise is basically a single set of tools, a single set of processes that are very, very efficient, very automated to basically simplify enterprise-wide data management for all of the application classes.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Tom or Nick, I wanted to go back over the restructuring and the operating margin target for FY '14. If you're taking out the 900 people and just making some base assumption on fully loaded costs, it seems like that could be anywhere around $130 million of savings. And I benchmarked that against operating margins that you reported for this fiscal year, fiscal year rather, it seems like you could do over 17% operating margins for FY '14. And so I just wanted to try understand a little bit, are you -- is it -- is there additional expense going to be layered in on top of those headcount reductions? That is to say, it's not a net savings? Or is there some element of conservatism in there? If you could just talk about perhaps the timing for the restructuring and perhaps the net investments that go in over the top of that?","Thomas Georgens","Yes. Thanks, Keith. I think, first and foremost, this is not effectively a cut-and-freeze strategy here. I think this is fundamentally a realignment. There are set of things that we need to do to be successful, whether it be driving adoption of clustered ONTAP, whether it be the success of our flash offerings and the introduction of flash array and whether it be other things that are on the roadmap that are not public. Likewise, the go-to-market activity needs to be aligned around the alliance partners, as that heats up, not just Cisco. And we said we just won a Microsoft Partner of the Year award yesterday. That continues to heat up for us. So that's clearly an investment area that we want to go after, and we need to go after that in such a way that -- it's cognizant of the fact that it's going to be a low-growth environment, and we're not going to see a lot of expansion of the operating expense envelope. So yes, we cut back and that freed up the resource to redeploy. Some of those resources are part of the company, and we can redeploy them. And some of them are not, and we need to add over time. That's why we still expect to be hiring this quarter. We still expect to be hiring each of the quarters the rest of the way. So obviously, if the top line doesn't materialize and this business industry slows down even more than we're concerned about now, we'll modulate that. But right now, we do have an investment plan to basically align around the key initiatives that's built into our plan for the year. And that's what's driving the estimates that Nick put out for the full year numbers.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, fair enough. And Tom, is the OEM business a part of those anticipated cuts?","Thomas Georgens","Well, let's be clear, they're not anticipated. For the most part, we're allowed by law. They are, in fact, complete. So -- and just -- and one of those things that we don't like to have that hanging over our employee base, so we like to do that -- when we do this, we like to do this quickly. The -- on the OEM side, recognize that the E-Series branded business is actually moving along quite nicely, not just the flash side but in general. So technology is the same. But nonetheless, I think that there's OEM-specific activities, both on the development side and the go-to-market side that we -- that are part of the restructuring and that would fall into the category of a realignment. And that is there are some things that we're not going to invest in to free up resources to invest in another places. And clearly, the OEM side, both on the technical side, the go-to-market side and the support side, clearly, falls into that category.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee.","Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just on the outlook for the OEM business into fiscal '14 here from a modeling perspective, should we be building from this Q4 level as sort of the base and maybe some -- a couple of points of growth? Or is there going to be still some issues with partners coming in and out of the program?","Nicholas R. Noviello","So first of all, in terms of the modeling of it, we -- when we first saw and talked about the OEM business in Q3, the business was down significantly in Q3. We said that Q4 was going to be a branded-led quarter. And what we felt was happening was that the OEM business was starting to come down to the net normal, right? We had expected -- actually, when we did the Engenio transaction 2 years ago now, that -- pretty quickly, that would occur and we're probably around a year of delay. But starting in Q3, we saw the decline. So I would expect to see a continued decline, certainly, on a year-over-year basis as we go into Q1 and Q2 and now normalize that business going forward. But in terms of the parties we work with, we're always looking to selectively expand partners. And then also partners make decisions in terms of whether they want to do more business with us or not. That's part of that business, the overall OEM business that we're in.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I think the OEM business really falls really into 3 categories that drive the number, and one of them is how is their business doing overall, and that's something that you guys know so well. Obviously, there's share shift within the existing OEMs, which ones want to do more with us, which ones want to push their own intellectual property. And then the other one is selectively adding new OEMs, and pretty much all of those things are factors going forward. So over the past year, we've seen share shift in terms of focusing on their own IP, clearly at IBM. And that's been a factor and that is probably the biggest factor in the number as we go forward. But we have some new wins to potentially offset that. But 2 things to recognize is that in the OEM business, it's not just the E-Series and Engenio. It also includes the prior FAS business. The N Series is part of the OEM calculation. And the other side is that we're seeing the branded side of E-Series pick up. So with some stabilization of the OEM business over time and the branded business continuing on its trajectory, as you see that in the aggregate E-Series being a growth business for us next fiscal year.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian White with Topeka.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about Europe. It was the only geography to fall quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year. Obviously, it's been challenged but maybe just some color on Europe, please.","Thomas Georgens","Well -- and currency. So currency took about 0.5 point off the total number for the entire year-over-year and actually took several points off the Europe number. So all things considered, I think Europe held up reasonably well. As I indicated, the booking performance is a little bit stronger than the revenue performance in every geography. And so Europe was kind of mid-single digit, so not tremendous off the double-digit growth we saw in the Americas and public sector. But nonetheless, I think in light of the headlines, I think we have a little bit less exposure to some of those areas that were hit harder than others. But we actually finished with some strength in Germany. We had a strong year all year in France. So I think it's a tough environment. Certainly, the -- I believe that aggregate GDP of the EU is negative, at least from a growth perspective. And -- but I think the team is executing well. So it's hard to be optimistic about Europe, but I think that, that's an area where we're doing better than the competition in aggregate. And I think, overall, the team is basically dealing with a tough environment and actually doing reasonably well. But the strength, particularly in Germany, the finish and the strength of France all year has been notable, and I think we've got a little bit less exposure for some of the places that have been weak.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Alexander with Raymond James.","Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","If the EPS grows mid-teens before taking into account the buyback, Nick, and assuming the 17% operating margin for the year, backing into roughly 5% revenue growth for fiscal '14, and that would imply no acceleration from what you're expecting in Q1 for your guidance. So can you just confirm that and put that into context of what your branded growth expectations are and whether you expect that to accelerate off of Q1? And just related to that, given your previous comments about growing 2x the market from your Analyst Day a year ago, would this suggest you're assuming the storage market grows 2% to 3%? Or would it suggest a lower growth premium for NetApp?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes. So let me start on that one, so certainly, we are not giving full year revenue guidance, right? What we're giving you is from a gross margin and operating margin and EPS perspective, those things that we're aiming at, right? Obviously, there's a set of revenue numbers that we're working through. But in terms of giving specific revenue guidance beyond Q1, we're not doing that. All of those things will -- we will report to you and we will come out and discuss with you on a quarterly basis. On the Q1, as an example, right, the $1.475 billion to $1.575 billion is 2% to 9% growth, 6% of the midpoint, right? And when we look at the sequential decline in the business, that 11% sequential decline at the midpoint, if we look at our historical sequential for a 3-year period over -- or a 5-year period of time, those numbers are in the 9% to 10%. So the Q1 revenue at the midpoint is pretty reasonable. With respect to a normal sequential historical reduction, obviously, there's a little bit more conservatism in there based upon the realignment action and wanting to get rolling there quickly and a little bit of conservatism based around the ongoing OEM and what's happening on that piece of the business. But that's Q1, and we'll go quarter-to-quarter from there.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I think overall -- I think one of the things about trying to ride back from the operating profit also is the assumption about operating expense. And I think the key component here is that it's our intension to invest in the business, that we do see opportunity. We're certainly not in hunker-down mode. As I indicated, we have more racks open today than we did a month ago. So we're all looking to invest, and we're all looking to go forward. So perhaps, in terms of your modeling, if you're conservative on operating expense, you become necessarily conservative on the top line. As far as the overall growth of the market, I think that there's -- yes, there's a lot of moving parts. And certainly, the forecast for 2013 from the industry analyst is lower than it was for 2014 -- for 2012, and we're certainly taking that into account. But nonetheless, I think -- I see us as a share gainer. And I said -- when I say internal for the company, it's the same as if I say external. And that is -- yes, we're focused on share gain because share gain is share gain, whether the market is up or the market is down. And if we're gaining share that we're winning, we're going to continue to invest. But clearly, the absolute magnitude of that investment is going to be modulated by IT spending and the growth of the storage industry, which nobody is predicting to be particularly robust or at least a significant rebound in the near term.","Operator","The next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just to clarify, Nick, if you could help with the headcount reduction and how it would be split across R&D and sales and marketing. And Tom, more broadly, NetApp has historically invested into macroeconomic weakness, so are you saying you expect this to continue for quite some time? Or are there components of the business that were just run inefficiently? You're just saying it's not competitive and not secular, so what caused the change of direction here?","Nicholas R. Noviello","All right. So quickly, in terms of the reductions, of the disinvestment if you will, the disinvestment is -- has parts in sales, parts in engineering, parts in the G&A line, so it will show up across the income statement. And then as Tom indicated, this is also a realignment in our reinvestment into the areas of growth, certainly in terms of product, in terms of where we're going and in terms of our go-to-market side of the fence.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. And like I said, I don't -- like I said earlier is that I don't see this as any change of strategy. I think that we need to be cognizant of the world around us. I think as we came out of Q4 and obviously build the AOP or the annual plan for this current year, obviously, we need to be cognizant of what the analysts are saying, what we see. But that said, I think we came out of Q4 strong. I think the team felt good about where we were. Certainly, the field believes that they're winning and has a fair amount of confidence, is that our own Q4 dynamics overcoming the seasonality that we see but, clearly, been a tough earnings season the last 45 days. And we see what other people are saying out there as well. So for us, I think we probably saw more business pushed out at Q3 than we saw pushed out at Q4. We brought the business in. I think we have some momentum, but I think we need to be careful. We see what the IT environment is. Obviously, they're maybe for another debt ceiling fight. We had brought up Europe on this call. Obviously, we have some restructuring activity. But in terms of customer-facing, quota-carrying people, there has not been much of a change on that front. And in terms of engineering on the key projects that are going to drive our growth going forward, that investment is only increasing. So I think for us, I would consider us that we are investing in the key areas into this environment. We are, by no means, into a status quo or a freeze. In fact, we're trying to aggressively move resources to the things that matter most. And the feeling was, as we enter this new year, we reinstated incentive comp. We plan our capital. This is the time to basically take the reset and build the plan that we could all believe in and gives us multiple ways to get the double-digit EPS growth. And I don't think we have that optionality a year ago, but we have it now. And that's what we're committed to deliver, even if the macro continues to stay constant or, in fact, deteriorates.","Operator","The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Nick, I just had a follow-up and a little bit of a clarification on the prior question or the earlier question on, I guess, share repurchase impact and that as distinct from the operational guidance that you're giving. I guess the clarification is, so there's no, I guess, share repurchase impact in the 367 million share guidance for the July quarter. But it sounds like you will be pretty active in the market. So whatever you do would be in addition to that, and that's kind of the clarification. And then I guess, as I do the sort of the math, the back of the envelope, if we're assume that you buy back the shares ratably through the year. It comes out the -- thing on share count, I don't know, like 12.5 million to 14 million shares out per quarter, if I lag that by a quarter, it would actually seem to suggest above the mid-teens operational growth that you can probably do, I don't know, maybe 500 basis points more of EPS growth, which should get to the high teens in that range. Is -- are we reading that right, which is EPS actually more high -- EPS guidance of fiscal year '14 really more high-teens type of growth? And I know that's a lot, but I appreciate any insight.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes. Ananda, let me work you through that. So first of all, remember I indicated that this first tranche will be over the next 4 months, okay? So it's not necessarily all in the first quarter. And it's actually 4 months from today. The 367 million shares for the first quarter is in fact without repurchase, okay? We will obviously give you updates as we go here and give you very clear view of what we've repurchased in the quarter. But you can imagine that the repurchases don't all happen necessarily at once. They're not falling necessarily at the front end. They're generally spread around. So we'll give you that color. But we wanted to make very, very clear, and as Tom indicated before, distinguish operational results, right, from results that we are achieving on the capital side of the fence. And part of the whole capital allocation philosophy here is a benefit over time from the redeployment of cash into repurchase. So really focusing today on the operational is what we want to do.","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I think as we think about this plan, it's $3 billion over 3 years and, likewise, the dividend. So the view that we're trying to convey here is that, a, we've got some optionality from a capital standpoint and that we can think about the capital in terms of returns to shareholders. But the other component to this is that it's got an element over time that we think the cash flow of this company is sustainable. In fact, we see, with growth, ability to continue to grow our free cash flow as a company. And we're looking to make a commitment over 3 years, both on the dividend side and on the buyback side, to basically return that capital to shareholders as a certified NetApp going forward. So overall, I think from our perspective is this is not just a 4-month phenomenon. This is a 3-year commitment and to basically return capital to shareholders as NetApp continues its very, very strong cash flow generation.","So I think we've come to the end of our time. I'd like to thank everybody on the call for their interest in NetApp and for attending today, and we look forward to seeing you again in about 90 days. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Kris Newton. Kris Newton, you may begin.","Kris Newton","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are our CEO, Tom Georgens; and our CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com, along with the earnings release, the supplemental commentary, our financial tables and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections, including our financial outlook for Q4 and expected dilution from our convertible notes, as well as the benefits to us and our customers of our products, our expectations regarding future competitive position and expected benefits of partnerships, alliances and acquisitions, all of which involve risk and uncertainty.","Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including among other things, general economic and market conditions and matters specific to the company's business such as customer demand for and acceptance of our products and services.

Noviello","Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. NetApp delivered solid financial results in fiscal Q3. Revenue of $1.63 billion was slightly above the midpoint of our prior guidance. We achieved non-GAAP gross margins of 60.4% and operating margins of 17.1%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 exceeded the high end of our Q3 guidance range, and we generated $254 million in free cash flow in the quarter, just under 16% of revenue.","Revenue increased 6% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. Revenue from our Americas commercial, EMEA and APAC geographies all grew, both sequentially and year-over-year. Revenue from our U.S. public sector geography was down sequentially as expected but was up 14% from Q3 a year ago. Branded revenue of $1.43 billion was up both sequentially and year-over-year. Branded revenue grew 7% from Q2 and 8% from Q3 last year, while OEM revenue declined 3% sequentially and 17% from Q3 a year ago. Product revenue was flat from last year but up 7% from Q2.","Non-GAAP gross margins of 60.4% were in line with prior guidance and our targeted financial model. Product gross margins of 53.1% were down slightly from Q2 related to customer mix. Service gross margins of 58.7% were up just over 1 point from Q2 due to lower costs and the more favorable mix of revenues related to service contracts versus professional services.","Non-GAAP operating margins of 17.1% were just inside the range of our targeted financial model and exceeded prior guidance for the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down slightly from Q2, reflecting lower variable compensation and conservatism in spending, given the overall business environment. Non-GAAP other income net was down from prior quarters, reflecting interest expense related to our senior notes offering in December.","Our Q3 effective tax rate was 13.6%, lower than prior guidance and reflected a prior year discrete item and current year cumulative benefit related to the R&D tax credit approved by Congress in early January. For Q4 and the fiscal year 2013, we now expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate just below 16%.","Non-GAAP EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.09, $0.03 of which was due to the lower effective tax rate and the remainder due to improved operating margins.","Our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $6.7 billion in cash and investments. The increase of approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments from Q2 reflects the $1 billion in 5- and 10-year senior unsecured notes we issued in December. Total deferred revenue increased by $106 million from Q2, and accounts receivable day sales outstanding decreased slightly from 36 to 35 days. Inventory improved to 14.9 turns, with inventory levels down and normalizing to more historical levels.","Cash from operations was $365 million, and free cash flow was $254 million. Free cash flow was reduced by approximately $70 million related to the buyout of our remaining off-balance-sheet synthetic leases. Overall cash also reflects the repurchase of approximately $62 million of stock in the quarter and the completion of the acquisition of Cache IQ. We expect to repurchase 2x to 3x more shares in Q4 than we did in Q3.","Diluted share count decreased in Q3 by approximately 3 million shares. The accounting for the shares associated with our $1.265 billion of convertible notes had minimal impact on diluted share count in the quarter. The notes become fully convertible in March and will mature at the beginning of June. At that time, we will settle them with $1.265 billion of U.S. cash paid to noteholders and to the extent the average share price is over the strike price of $31.85, shares of common stock associated with the conversion feature of the notes. This dilution will be partially offset by note hedges at that time. As you may recall, 80% of our convertible notes are hedged.","Separately, our related warrants will come due beginning in September 2013 and may also create dilution if our share price is over $41.28 at maturity. We expect to repurchase shares to offset any remaining dilution associated with the maturity of our convertible notes, as well as our warrants.","Our target revenue range for Q4 is $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, which at the midpoint implies just over 7% sequential growth and just under 3% year-over-year growth. We expect the growth of Branded revenue to exceed that of the total revenue and to be offset by flat to reduced OEM revenue. We expect consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 60% to 61% and non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 17%. We expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to be just below 16%, bringing our non-GAAP EPS estimate to approximately $0.65 to $0.70 per share. Diluted share count is projected to increase to about 372 million shares in Q4 based on our average stock price of $36.02 for the first 10 days of the quarter. This will include about 5 million shares from the convertible notes. Recall that the impact of the note hedges is not included as an offset.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tom for his thoughts. Tom?","Thomas Georgens","Thanks, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. In what remains a challenging macro environment, NetApp again performed well, with revenue coming in just above the midpoint of our prior guidance and EPS above the top of our range. The NetApp team remains focused on things that we can control: delivering innovation, expanding our partnerships and strengthening our go-to-market position. Our ability to execute in all of these areas by delivering innovative best-of-breed solutions creates a compelling reason for customers to choose our technology for the foundation of their shared and dedicated storage infrastructures and enables NetApp to deliver strong financial performance.","Our Branded business was strong again this quarter, growing at twice the rate of the total business year-over-year. Driven by the strong value proposition of Data ONTAP, the Branded business grew 8% from Q3 a year ago, its strongest growth in fiscal year '13. Data ONTAP is the #1 storage operating system and serves the needs of the shared storage infrastructure, which represents the vast majority of today's opportunity.","We are pleased to see strong customer adoption of ONTAP 8. Almost 50% of installed base has moved to ONTAP 8, and half of that has moved to the rapidly expanding 8.1 release introduced less than a year ago.","The adoption of clustered ONTAP is also seeing strong growth. The acceleration of clustered nodes continues, with units shipped up 70% from last quarter. We now have cumulatively shipped well over 2,000 clustered nodes. While some customers are still in the learning or early adopter stage, others have made it a standard for their data center. For example, in the course of 1 year, a new financial services customer has grown to 38 clustered nodes and roughly 12 petabytes of storage. In addition to the benefits of a limited scale performance and nondisruptive operations, customers value the reduction of complexity that clustered ONTAP brings to their environment.","NetApp has the most comprehensive Flash portfolio in the storage industry, offering solutions for both shared infrastructure and workload-specific requirements. As with clustered ONTAP, the value delivered by these solution is generating robust customer demand. Since the introduction of our first Flash solutions 3 years ago, we have shipped 36 petabytes of Flash, and more than 20,000 systems have been deployed with at least 1 NetApp Flash solution. By offering Flash solutions at the array, controller and server level, we enable our customers to get the performance they require at an optimum price. To date, NetApp customers have accelerated 3 exabytes of disk storage using Flash Cache. Bookings of systems with Flash Pools, our hybrid disk and SSD solution introduced in Q1, have increased 67% sequentially. Flash Accel, which enables customers to utilize server-based Flash to accelerate application performance without sacrificing any of the NetApp management capabilities, will begin shipping this quarter.","On last quarter's call, we talked about a highly competitive all-Flash array bake-off, in which we competed in one using the high-performance characteristics of E-Series and SSDs. In Q3, we booked more than 100 of these systems. You can expect NetApp to be much more aggressive on the all-Flash array front. Look for more news in the near future.","In Q3, we refreshed the FAS3000 family. The newly introduced FAS3220 and 3250 target enterprises and midsized businesses that are consolidating operations onto a shared storage platform. The new systems improved performance by up to 80% and increased storage capacity up to 100% over our existing products in this space. These new platforms already comprise 32% of the FAS3000 units shipped in the quarter. Overall, the units of the 3000 family were up 16% sequentially but down 24% year-over-year as there continues to be some migration between the FAS2000 and the older lower-end 3000 platforms. The FAS2000 product line continues to grow rapidly, with units up 10% from last quarter and up 55% from Q3 a year ago. The FAS6000 family was up 19% sequentially and flat from last year. In Q3, over 20% of our FAS6000 system shipped in clustered deployments and 19% shipped as hybrid arrays were Flash Pools.","Finally, over the course of fiscal year '13, we have seen a marked improvement in activity and pipeline for the Branded E-Series products. In Q3, we enhanced the E-Series Platform with improved performance, increased connectivity and greater data protection. Unit shipments of the E-series have grown 43% sequentially.","Partnering remains key to our strategy. Both our alliance partners and our reselling channel partners are core to our ability to globally deliver a complete innovation stack to our customers. There is no better example in the power of this strategy than FlexPod, a converged solution based on NetApp and Cisco technology sold by our joint channel partners for shared storage infrastructures. This solution has strong momentum, with over 2,100 customers in 35 countries and over 700 partners enabled to deliver the stack. During the quarter, we saw record new customer adoption of FlexPod.","In Q3, we expanded the Cisco partnership through deeper and broader solution integration and announced FlexPod for cloud service providers, FlexPod for branch offices and expanded application validation to include Oracle, SAP business objects, SAP HANA, Microsoft private cloud and the Citrix cloud platform. We also announced clustered ONTAP support for Citrix ShareFile, enabling customers who are storing their data on premise to leverage ONTAP software to access data, scale performance and capacity, reduce data center footprint and reduce costs.","Customers not only have a requirement for shared storage and dedicated storage infrastructures, they are also looking for new means of IT delivery utilizing the cloud. NetApp has long been focused on servicing the needs of the cloud service providers and customers looking for IT as a Service.","In Q3, we introduced NetApp private storage for Amazon Web Services, an enterprise storage solution that balances internal data center resources along with AWS cloud resources to best meet customer needs. The volume of activity around this solution is very promising.","Our indirect and OEM businesses represented 81% of revenue in Q3 and grew 7% from Q3 a year ago. Arrow and Avnet were 33% of total revenue, up from 27% of revenue last year. OEM business was 12% of revenue, down both sequentially and year-over-year. While we have always said that the OEM business will have a different growth profile than the Branded side, the 3% sequential decline was greater than we anticipated at the outset of the quarter. We continue to aggressively position our solutions with the OEM partners, some looking to do less business with us and others looking to grow.","We are pleased that we continue to make progress on our key initiatives: the adoption of clustered ONTAP, leadership in the Flash space and leverage through our channel and alliance partners. While there are some pockets of optimism, the global macro environment remains uncertain with renewed concerns in Europe and uncertainty in the U.S. federal spending due to looming sequestration. In every geography, we continue to see lengthening of sales cycles and large deals being drawn out. However, I am confident in our ability to execute and realize the payoff investments we have made in innovation and partnerships.","Finally, I would like to extend my congratulations to the entire NetApp team for being ranked #6 on FORTUNE's list of Great Places to Work. NetApp's culture is a competitive advantage and a key to our continued success. We are proud when our customers and partners say that it just plain feels different to work with NetApp. This recognition, our fifth year in the top 10, is evidence of our commitment to creating a model company.","At this point, I will open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have Kulbinder Garcha from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse on line with a question.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's Kulbinder from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. For Tom, I have a question, I guess. If I look at your full year, if I look at your guidance for the next quarter and even at the high end of the range, it looks like full year product revenue growth would still be down, maybe as much as 2%. I'm just trying to think, how do you think about that with respect to competitive environment, market share for the full fiscal year? How do you feel about that? And then kind of linked to that, your capacity growth only at 9%, which is much lower than any trend level we've seen historically. Do you have any insight as to why you're so low, Tom? Anything on that would be useful as well.","Thomas Georgens","So, obviously, a few questions there. I think in terms of our guidance for next quarter, clearly, it's a factor in the macro as we see it, the factors that I talked about in the prepared text around certainly concerned about sequestration, certainly concerned about Europe, negative GDP growth last quarter. I know we need to balance that against what we see, what our customers are telling us, what we see in our own business and what we see in the pipeline. That's what ultimately leads to the number. I think, certainly, it's a difficult environment to be aggressive in, but the guidance we gave is a combination of all those factors, probably a tough macro and perhaps a little bit more focused on our own customer base, where, clearly, we've had some momentum in the past 2 quarters. I think it's part of the product revenue. The key component there is to, ultimately, tease apart a couple of issues. Number one is the OEM business versus the Branded business. The OEM business is almost exclusively product revenue. So to the extent that there's a slowdown in that part of the business, it hits product revenue pretty hard. The Branded business is spread out a little bit more than that. But if I look at this particular quarter, our Branded business was actually up 8% year-over-year. That's the strongest performance of our Branded business all year long. So if anything, that business is probably stronger now than it's been all along. To kind of glean the market share out of all of that is what is the product revenue growth of the Branded business because that's the only part that counts in the market share number, and I don't think we reported that. But the growth of the Branded product revenue, which would be correlated with the market share, is greater than our overall year-over-year growth. So that would put it in certainly single digits but mid single digits. And from a market share perspective, there might be somebody else at that level, but I don't see anybody doing better than that. So I got to believe that this number from a market share perspective has to be an increase in terms of our performance year-over-year. The broader question around the drive capacity, that's a function of a few things. Part of that is also the OEM business is a factor in that as well. The OEM business was bigger last year. The other thing is -- also has to do with product mix. We certainly saw a big push of the low-end platforms, which are good upgradable platforms and new footprints for us for the future, a new customer acquisition. But they're not as capacity laden as some of the other ones. So I think at the end of the day, it's not something that we're alarmed about. I think it's a function of the product mix, both OEM versus Branded and, likewise, high end versus low end.","Operator","And we have Shebly Seyrafi from FBN Securities on line with a question.","Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","So your OEM business was actually getting worse. Growth-wise, I think it was down 17% last quarter versus down 9% in the prior quarter. It seems that's a big headwind, and I think you said in the prepared remarks that you expect flat to reduced growth in fiscal Q4. So are you thinking about this is it, basically, it's not going to be a headwind going forward and perhaps the product revenue growth can now accelerate to high single digits over the next year? And just your thoughts on that.","Thomas Georgens","What I think specifically about the OEM business is a few things. I think first and foremost, the OEM business is going to be dated by the sell-through with the OEM partners. And most of the partners in that portfolio have storage businesses that are actually down year-over-year and some by a substantial amount. But I think that's case #1. The other part of it, frankly, is that it was down lower than we would have thought. So clearly, there's the behavior of the OEMs itself. And I think the OEM business will be different than our Branded business in that it will be a combination -- it will tend to be a little bit more volatile over time as make-buy decisions on their part shift back and forth. Likewise, we add new OEMs, that tends to be lumpy. So I think in the long run, it's absolutely our aspiration to continue to grow this business. I expect it to be a little bit lumpy and a little bit volatile certainly compared to our Branded business. So certainly, it's not something that we're backing off on. I don't know if I'm necessarily going to call a bottom on it yet because that's going to be a function of the performance of our OEM partners. But that said, it's still an investment area, it's still an opportunity for us, and we're still looking to add new partners, which we did last quarter.","Nicholas R. Noviello","And the other point that I should add on top of that is that the E-Series OEM side of it, the E-Series Branded side of it, is actually picking up the pace quite a bit, and we actually saw some good momentum, particularly around the Flash products.","Operator","And we have Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray on line with a question.","Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just want to touch base on the telco side. I think last quarter, you called out revenue doubled from the prior year. Did you mention anything on how that vertical performed this quarter? And then could you just provide any color in terms of what's driving that demand?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think first of all, it's robust again. I don't think we put a number on it this quarter, not wanting to mix bookings and revenues, but it was still very, very strong. In certain areas of the world, we actually have a go-to-market channel that's around telco and service providers, which isn't the entire service provider opportunity. It does include SaaS vendors and stuff like that. And that was the strongest performing sector in the U.S. by far. So overall, that business remains robust. We made a bet a couple of years ago that this was going to be a big element of growth for us and a big segment as customers think about IT as a Service and they think about service providers. And if I look at where we are with the service providers, where we are with the various different cloud providers, I think that those investments are paying off, and I think we're seeing that in the growth. Certainly, other people have talked about the growth of that segment. But I think the role of the service providers, the role of IT as a Service, is increasing over time and necessitated a focus. But part of that business tends to look like an OEM business, and that is, you kind of work with them, you get design wins, you get design into their practices and their services and then they need to sell through. And I think we're clearly seeing that. So from a service provider perspective, although there isn't a really great number out there, but I would eventually guess that our market share there is higher than our aggregate market share in the entire industry. And I feel good about the payoff we're getting from those investments we made a couple of years ago.","Operator","And we have Brian Marshall from ISI on line with a question.","Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, if you look at my entire covered universe, you have the highest percent of your market cap and net cash. And I was curious if you could give us a quick update on your thoughts with respect to M&A and pursuing innovation through external measures as opposed to internal. And then also from a capital allocation perspective, love to get an updated thought there as well.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Brian, this is Nick. Let me start that, and I'm sure if Tom has some comments, he'll add on to it. If you look at the cash and investments balance at the end of the quarter here, this is reflective of the notes and the $1 billion of notes that we issued in December. The other thing to think about is 50% of the cash is in the U.S. So a couple of things going on, let me kind of work through the pieces here. We have $1.265 billion of convertible notes coming due in June. Those are cash-settled convertible notes. So that is a $1.265 billion of U.S. cash due in June. So you have to really take that off of the 50% of cash and investments balance. Now let me kind of work the other side for a second, which is what are we doing with cash. If I look at cash from operations year-to-date, I pick that off the cash flow statement, 80% of that has been reinvested in the business. It's been reinvested in the business or returned to shareholders. The reinvestment from the business CapEx side, on the acquisition side, we've now got a set of technology tuck-ins that we've done. In terms of returns to shareholders, we've got a set of returns, 410 million so far this year. We're going to do some additional in the fourth quarter. All of those pieces will come through this year and show up in these numbers. So if I roll back to what I indicated at our Financial Analyst Day last June, it was really balanced in the use of cash, balanced in the use of cash in terms of investing in the business, balanced in terms of investing in M&A, balanced in terms of return to shareholders. We're doing all of those things. We expect to continue to do all of those things. We're in a period here where we've got a convertible note coming due in June. We've got senior debt that we issued in December. We've got a set of synthetic leases which were the remaining off-balance-sheet synthetic leases that are now done and taken care of in Q3. All of those things are kind of coming together and are part of clearing up and making obvious the capital allocation philosophy.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I think another way to solve the cash as a percentage of market cap, obviously, is to make the stock price go up. And so we're working on that, too. But I think in general to your question on acquisitions, I've said in the past that as far as  tuck-ins go, I think you should expect, just as we get bigger, we're looking for technologies, probably the rate of that will increase modestly. We did one last quarter. We just announced one today. So I think you should expect that kind of cadence going forward in terms of small tuck-in-type acquisitions. In terms of larger transactions, those are going to be very asynchronous. They're going to be a function of the opportunity, the price, the executability, obviously, the strategic fit. So I wouldn't forecast any trend on larger deals. Those are going to be entirely opportunistic. But as far as tuck-in activity, I think you should expect to see us, just as we get bigger and get more focused on this area, that probably, our historical rate will increase a bit. And like I said, you've just seen 2 in the last 2 quarters.","Operator","And we have Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets on line with a question.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on your gross margin, especially on the product side. Can you talk about your -- despite the sequential growth you saw in Jan quarter, which you're expecting in April as well, it looks like gross margins are all kind of stuck in that 60.5% range at the midpoint. Could you just talk maybe what are the headwinds you see that's negating maybe the better revenue growth and then the better mix you're getting from stronger Branded revenues all year?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes. So I think there's a couple of things there, Amit. Let me start -- this is, again, Nick. Let me just start with quarter in Q3. And there was a set of questions going from Q to Q -- from Q2 to Q3 guidance and really a set of questions on what's going on, on the product side of the fence. Because if you looked at the guidance, it would suggest that the gross margins on the product side would be down a little bit. What's going on, on the service side of the fence? There's some different things going on in both areas. Okay? First of all, on the product of the fence, we suggested that -- and I think there was a specific question last quarter. \"Hey, are product gross margins going to go higher?\" We said, \"Hold on a second, there's a couple of things going on.\" First of all, we have an OEM business. We've got a little bit of calendar year-end drag that's going to happen in product gross margins from an OEM business. As we close the quarter, there's probably less of that drag than we expected. There's probably some other elements that offset that in a few other areas in product gross margin. But at the end of the day, the 53.1% we did was probably pretty close to what we expected. There's been a noise over the last year on disk drives and the drag associated with disk drives. That's all behind us now. Q2 is generally a higher configuration mix quarter. That obviously is not going to happen in Q3. So all of the things, they're never going to be exactly as you'd expect, but all of those things came together and overall product gross margin kind of in the range of what we'd expect. If I look back 16 quarters, or if I look at Q3 to Q4 for the last 4 years, product gross margin is flattish to up. That's what we're expecting in the guidance here. It's flattish to up. It's a combination of what's going on in the Branded business, and it's a combination of the OEM side of the fence. If OEM revenue is flat to down, there's less drag because OEM revenue carries a lower product gross margin than the rest of the business. On the service side of the fence, we have inside Q3 a little bit better gross margin than we originally anticipated associated with mix of business. On the service side of the fence, we also manage and make investments from time-to-time. And many times because those investments are made to service the growing installed base, you make the investments in front of the installed base growth, okay, which means you are making them in advance of the revenue growth. So sometimes, that will mean that you've got a service growth -- gross margin decline in front of the revenue that occurs. We build all of those factors together and look at those in combination from Q3 to Q4. So in terms of the guidance range of 60% to 61%, again, I think that's based upon the bottom-up roll-up that I just took you through in some respects here. It's based upon the revenue side of the fence and that flat to down on the OEM and the up on the Branded side, on the product revenue side, and it's based upon the continued growth of installed base and the investments we need to make on the service side of our business from time to time.","Operator","And we have Keith Bachman from Bank of Montr\u00e9al on line with a question.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'd like to ask about your free cash flow targets. This quarter, I think it came in about 16% of revenues. In the past, you've talked about targets more in the 18-plus percent or 18% to 20%. And yet over the past few quarters, this has been tracking a little bit below that in kind of the 16% to 17%. Could you just talk a little bit about what you expect in the near term, in the April quarter, but more importantly, just talk about your longer-term targets for free cash flow yield, please?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes. So Keith, one of the impacts, and we talked about this last quarter, to free cash flow in Q3, was the buyout of those synthetic leases, right? [indiscernible] CapEx, that's going to drag free cash flow performance as a percentage of revenue. Our expectation is to be able to get back to that range we talked about at our Analyst Day. Our expectation would be for continued performance on the cash flow side of the fence in Q4. And so I think if I take it to the overall model, the expectation is to continue to move towards the ranges we've put out there, and you see that on the gross margin side. We're inside the range on that model we put out there, which was 60% to 62% for Q3. We hit the low end of the range of the operating margin, 17% to 19%. And we'll continue to work on the free cash flow side.","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I believe the impact of the synthetic lease buyout was $70 million.","Nicholas R. Noviello","$70 million.","Thomas Georgens","So that's a real number in the context of our overall free cash flow generation. In fact, you back that number out, we're pretty much in the range.","Operator","And we have Mr. Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital on line with a question.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Just a question on OpEx, if I could. All 3 OpEx lines are down from the October quarter. And I went back -- I just took a look back to the history. It's the first time, with the exception of the recession going back to the early 2000s, that, that was the case. So there was some anecdotal comments, I guess, in the prepared remarks about just being prudent. But could you -- it seems like for Jan quarter and the April quarter, there's a little bit more prudency than typical. And I'm just wondering if there's a sort of any kind of conscious shift in strategy and how long we might expect that to continue.","Thomas Georgens","Certainly, there's been no shift in strategy other than, clearly, it's a challenging environment. We need to be careful, whether it be in the guidance that we give or the targets we give it internally. But we still have a very, very broad agenda of expanding our partnerships, ongoing innovation, the introduction of clustered ONTAP. And you'll see some other announcements from us very, very shortly around some new technologies that we spent some time working on. So the investment profile is still pretty robust. And so we certainly haven't backed off on the innovation agenda, but we're being careful about how we spend on other types of things and trying to keep this well within the envelope of reasonableness. Clearly, until there's a high-growth environment, then we need to be very, very careful on the OpEx in order to continue to drive the operating margin improvement. And as Nick indicated, we're now in the range of our long-term model in terms of gross margin. We're in the range of our long-term model in terms of operating margin this quarter. And our guidance for next quarter would imply similarly. But clearly, we need to be generating growth in this business. So we certainly aren't going to cut off R&D and preclude future growth.","Operator","And we have Brian Alexander from Raymond James on line with a question.","Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, just a follow-up on E-Series. Tom, given some of the enhancement you've made for the platform, do you see E-Series competing more with some of your OEM customers' Branded offerings? And\/or are the lines blurring at all with your core FAS offerings that you have these features and that, that may be contributing to the accelerated OEM declines we saw this quarter? Or do you still see this is an entirely separate use case?","Thomas Georgens","I think it's substantially a separate use case. I'd say in the specific case of IBM, clearly, they've got their own portfolio. And the positioning of the product within their portfolio, there's unquestionably overlap, and that's got clearly a factor. And I think that's certainly true now. It's certainly true even before Ingenio, where we have the E-Series. So I think the IBM is probably the one where there's competing factions within the portfolio. I think the other partners range from totally committed to this technology to having a clear defendable spot for this that doesn't have as much overlap. So I'd say partially in your question, yes, it's certainly true of IBM. In terms of competing with FAS, that's a lot less likely. Clearly, the price performance profile of this product really aimed at optimizing price performance and capacity is a segment that we've not gone after with FAS, per se. And if you look at where it's been successful, the vertical markets around high-performance computing, around media management, around video, around full Flash arrays, those are things where the price performance value proposition shows through, and I don't really think that, that's bleeding off any material FAS business. And that business, it's growth, plus the FAS business has generated the 8% Branded revenue growth that we saw this quarter. And we're quite pleased about that. That's certainly the best number we've seen in the year.","Operator","And we have Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley on line with a question.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit about linearity in the quarter? And specifically, what did you see demand-wise in the month of January after all the noise around the fiscal cliff in December?","Thomas Georgens","Well, for us, this is somewhat of an unusual quarter for us because we've got the calendar year in the middle of our quarter. And I would say the fiscal cliff and the looming sequestration and impact on federal spending, certainly, while the federal and U.S. public sector number growth were actually quite good, I wouldn't say that we were immune from those dynamics in any way. We certainly saw big deals being stretched out. We saw greater approval cycles necessary to make business happen. And I think the key to that is we just need to have more things in the hopper that are going to come out the other side. So I wouldn't say that our business wasn't subject to all the dynamics that you're hearing from everybody else. I just think we're in more deals, so we've got more partners engaged. And as far as linearity in the quarter, I would say that it wasn't that much different than other quarters that we've seen. I'd say that the budget flush at the end of the year was within range, although certainly not robust. And as far as January goes, since we're trying close the quarter when other people are starting to begin a quarter, I think our January dynamics are a little bit different than other people. So I wouldn't want to generalize on January. There's a lot of budgets that are being created, a lot of uncertainty in our customer base. So we'll see how it plays out. But like I said, I don't think that given our guidance and given the numbers that we put up in the EPS, I wouldn't say that we are immune to the dynamics. I just think we're in more deals, we're more engaged and we have our partners more engaged. And it's allowing us to have many irons in the fire now, and they came through for us this quarter.","Operator","And we have Maynard Um from Wells Fargo on line with a question.","Maynard Joseph Um - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm curious if you can share your philosophy on market share versus margin preservation. Were there deals you walked away from? Or would you walk away from deals that are low product margin structure? Or would you manage the business more to a product margin? If you can just kind of share the philosophy there, I'd appreciate it.","Thomas Georgens","Well, clearly, as a company, we have to preserve the business model. So we're not going to chase business at any price. We have a field organization, particularly at the senior levels, that are very, very heavily compensated on margin on deals. But it's a portfolio. And would we take low margin business? Yes, we do. I don't think -- I'm not ashamed to say that. But it's a function of a number of factors. It's a function and a territory of what their portfolio looks like, or they basically have a good mix of good solid deals that they can absorb some low margin deals. And it's a function of where the opportunity leads. Sometimes, breaking into some big accounts takes some sacrifice on our part if we believe that there's big opportunity for us going forward, and those are strategic decisions we make every day. So absolutely, we walk away from ugly deals that we believe are not leverageable in the future or are not strategic to us, or a poor fit for our technology. Clearly, that happens. On the other hand, we also take some very ugly deals as long as they fit within the broader portfolio and where we are in the quarter, and we think that there's longevity and long-term opportunity in those accounts.","Operator","And we have Rajesh Ghai from Craig-Hallum on line with a question.","Rajesh Ghai - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","You've seen several announcements over the past few months which indicate that Cisco and NetApp are coming closer, at least as it relates to FlexPod. I was wondering if you could share any data, any quantitative information as to how this Cisco leadership has benefited you for the past few quarters, either in terms of the trajectory of revenue or for FlexPods or new customer wins.","Thomas Georgens","Well, we certainly share the FlexPod numbers on the call. And that number, I believe, is 2,100 new customers. In fact, we had the biggest acquisition of new customers around FlexPod this quarter. So I don't really see any slowing down of that momentum. And I think the key independent of any specific product component is I think that there's good alignment between NetApp and Cisco. I think our long-term view of the market and the role of Ethernet-based storage, I think we're very much aligned on that. I think if we think about how we go to market and very partner-centric, I think we're very much aligned on that. And I think the other component that we can underestimate is in terms of our aspiration and opportunity in the business. I think the opportunity for strategic overlap and strategic conflict is a lot less with NetApp than, potentially, some other partners. And as a result, I think we've got some good, clear momentum with a lot of runway ahead of us. So FlexPod is certainly something that's worked out very, very well. I think it's certainly been material to our business. I believe it's been material for Cisco as well. And some of the recent announcements that we did around some future joint development is actually expanding that not only in the FlexPod domain but around other use cases as well. So I think we're very, very pleased with the Cisco relationship. I think there's great alignment between the 2 companies. And I think that there's a clear runway of not a lot of strategic overlap and not a lot of conflict. And I think, frankly, that has helped us as well.","Operator","And we have Ben Reitzes from Barclays on line with a question.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. I wanted to go back to the OEM business. Without the decline year-over-year in the high teens would have been quite a product quarter if that could have been a lot flatter. I guess the question is, looking in the next couple of quarters, Tom, how do you manage that decline? Should it -- do you feel it's possible to say that can actually maybe flatten out at some point? Or is it just something that we should model declining and a drag on the business like it was in the last quarter?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think to answer that question, you'd have to predict the business trajectory of our partners, which, in many cases, look like the overall market. And I think that's probably a good first path approximation about where this is going. I think for us, in terms of the E-Series OEM, and the NetApp FAS OEM is in there as well, clearly, this isn't something that we're anywhere close to surrendering on. In fact, I see growth opportunity there. We're certainly pursuing other OEM partners. But I think that we need to be careful on the OEM business that we also bear in mind that within the OEM context and that technology set is also coming E-Series Branded, which is becoming more and more important to our business and we're seeing good bookings growth there. So E-Series in the aggregate last quarter -- last year had OEM business well ahead of our forecast and a little bit of slow ramp on the Branded side. This year, we're seeing the OEM business coming down a bit and certainly disappointing relative to that. But we are seeing the pickup on the other side. So in the aggregate, the E-Series is probably moving closer to where we originally anticipated this business to be, but we need some more Branded pickup to really get there. But as far as the OEM business, clearly, it's something that we want to see. It's very, very prone to the dynamics of the OEMs themselves. Their own make-buy decisions, and that's a business that will be volatile because those make-buy decisions can change. And when they do change, you can go one way or the other. But we're looking to add more partners. We have added more partners, and we clearly want to see growth out of that. But if we can see growth out of that business and continue the acceleration of the E-Series, I think that's a big amount of impending growth in that category that we've not yet realized, not really seeing on our P&L yet.","Operator","And we have Steve Milunovich from UBS on line with a question.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, could you dig a little bit deeper in your government exposure, which, as you pointed out, was very strong, up 14% year-over-year? Yet you indicated some caution going forward. Maybe talk about some of the components of that. And do you still expect maybe single-digit growth going forward or it could be worse?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think as we put together the guidance, we look at a number of factors and then weight those. So, I mean, clearly, we can all make our bet on how sequestration is going to play out. Is it going to play out as currently stated? Are they going to kick the can down the road? Is there going to be some type of compromise? And those are the things that we factor in. The other thing about the sequestration is it's not the entire federal business, and there are other areas of that, that we've actually had a pretty good quarter. And as you know, we've been trying to diversify our federal business over the last couple of years, and we've done that. And the other component of our public sector business is actually state local, and that actually has been a very, very high-growth business for us. And now, it's not a trivial part of our business anymore. Two years ago, when we started that, it was relatively small, and that's continuing to grow. The health care segment part of that is also healthy. So in terms of the U.S. public sector, I think it would be hard for us to claim that sequestration will be good for our business. But I think we're a bit more diversified than we used to be. But nonetheless, I think we need to be careful, and that's factored into the guidance we gave.","Operator","And we have Peter Misek from Jefferies on line with a question.","Peter Misek - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to get some color on penetration and pipeline for ONTAP upgrades and how it's looking for the rest of the year. Can you give us any data on how many people have upgraded or what kind of upgrade activity you have, trials, projects, et cetera, and how the pipeline looks for the rest of the year?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think first and foremost, the sequential growth now has been very, very strong sequential growth, 3 quarters in a row. And the actual number of systems out there was over 2,000. So it's not a trivial number anymore. When we look at the 6,000 family, which is our largest systems, over 20% of those are being shipped with clustered ONTAP now. Now, in general, most of the clustered ONTAP nodes are coming with new equipment as opposed to being upgrading old equipment in the field. That's a general trend. So for us, it appears to be the momentum is very, very high. We did our training sessions at the end of last year for our technical people and our partner technical people. We did that in Europe, United States and Asia, and it was very, very well-received. So this is clearly a technology that we're pushing with very, very high energy. And I think that right now, the ramp is probably steeper than we anticipated. And if I had to summarize, I'd say they were probably a little bit slower starting, but the ramp is actually steeper than we thought. So I think that with the latest releases of the software, perhaps the last hesitancy both on the part of our sales force and on the part of customers may have been cleared away. And certainly, post-8.1, the acceleration has been quite severe.","Operator","And we have Jayson Noland from Robert Baird on line with a question.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Tom, I wanted to ask about Amazon. Any more color you can offer on the partnership? What does the economics look like to NetApp? And, I guess, how do you think about cannibalization here longer-term?","Thomas Georgens","Well, in some ways, I kind of consider this similar to -- in the questions we got 4 or 5 years ago around de-duplication, and the question is, is that good for our business or bad for our business? And if we have 99% market share, then it might be a concern. But as far as Amazon, I think the simple fact of the matter is, is that they're spending billions of dollars building an infrastructure. There are certain use cases that are going to be interesting to customers. And customers have to manage the hybrid nature of it, that they'll have some data on-prem and some data off-prem. And it's an opportunity for ONTAP to basically manage that for them. So we can look at Amazon as purely a competitor, or we can look at it as somebody we can sell product to, but I think that there's a lot of value in us thinking about Amazon as an alliance partner that's going to build an infrastructure that will be integral to the environment and how do we enable customers to use that and use that effectively. It's a way for us to partner with Amazon. It's a way for us to help solve a problem for end users. And the way I see it is data will be in a lot of places. It will be on-prem. It will be in service providers. It will be on Flash arrays. It will be on FAS arrays. It will be in hyperscale providers like Amazon. And as far as we're concerned that what we want to do is we want to be in a position to manage all of that data no matter where it lives. And the other thing about the offering that we provide is an opportunity to have access to the customer could use the server farms that Amazon has, they could use the storage as well, or they could use NetApp storage all at the same time. And I think that's what's unique about it. So for us, what's innovative and what's really interesting is the customer response to this. We just got briefed on this yesterday and very, very strong customer response that's interesting in this technology. And maybe in a simple way of putting this, we don't make disk drives, but we do software to manage them. And I think we want to bring the AWS environment into our management domain. So I think there's an opportunity to innovate here, there's an opportunity to create value. And yes, will some storage go in that direction? Absolutely. I'm not in denial about that. But if we can manage that process and use data ONTAP as the central control point, then I think there's a big opportunity for us because customers clearly want to go that way with a certain set of their workloads.","Operator","And we have Louis Miscioscia from CLSA on line with a question.","Louis R. Miscioscia - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Tom, a question pretty much in line with that one that was just asked. When you look at some of the startups like Nirvanix and Cleversafe, they're not exactly like AWS even though some of the technology under their coverage is the same thing. But obviously, they're looking to manage the data themselves. So has that taken away any of your business, I guess, either in the last calendar year or looking forward? And maybe if you could talk about your own product mix-based storage grid. And it's sort of been buried within NetApp, is it starting to emerge at some point?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think the whole cloud space is -- we can probably spend the whole call on that. And there's a bunch of definitions that we want to go through. But first of all, on-premise computing, really driving the private cloud enabled by virtualization, that's a big opportunity. It's an area we've been successful and something that I see still as a huge opportunity for NetApp, particularly on our clustered ONTAP, and that will continue to grow. Out of that, some of that business, customers are looking at SaaS models or IT as a Service. And in the process of doing that, that's been a big part of our service provider for us, is understanding that customers want to move in that direction. It creates a concentrated set of customers but ones that have massive scale and massive performance requirements and nondisruptive operation and multi-tenancy. And once again, that's a good match for clustered ONTAP. So some of that business will move to other types of cloud providers. And clearly, that's a target for us and something that we've invested in and actually one of the areas of our business that's growing the fastest. And then there's this broader category for hyperscalers, and that's what we're talking about here. I think that there are a set of workloads where those are not appropriate, and there's a set of workloads where those are, which means that end users are going to have some amount of their data on-premise, some data in service providers and some data at the hyperscalers. And I think somebody to broker all of that, I think, is really important. I think a single-point solution around any one of those is going to be an island of storage, and I think it's NetApp's opportunity to integrate those. So rather than doing Google or Azure or Amazon as purely a competitor, the question is, what about them as an alliance partner as part of the overall hierarchy of storage and the infrastructure of a data center? And that's our play, and it's really interesting to see what the response has been to this announcement that we did with Amazon.","Louis R. Miscioscia - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And your storage grid?","Thomas Georgens","Well, storage grid is clearly a different type of opportunity. What Amazon and some of these other technologies are driving is really object-based storage at scale. And whether people want to build that capability in-house, or we want to enable people to build a capability that can compete with Amazon or particularly around vertical markets like health care, clearly, we see storage grid in that particular domain. So there's no doubt that the role of object-based storage is becoming a bigger and bigger talking point with customers, and that's where we see storage grid playing.","Operator","And we have Glenn Hanus from Needham on line with a question.","Glenn Hanus - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Could you contrast -- you made a lot of comments about big deal sales cycles, deferrals. Could you sort of contrast where you see all that stuff today versus 3 months ago?","Thomas Georgens","Three months is kind of a narrow point of view.","Glenn Hanus - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Well, however you want to characterize it. Just trying to get kind of more color about the trend of that. Is it kind of getting better, worse? How do you see that now going forward as you look at your pipelines and stuff?","Thomas Georgens","Well, it's clearly anecdotal. It's company-by-company. It's industry-by-industry. Financial services is still an area where we see elongated cycles and, obviously, concern economically. On the other hand, there are certain geographies that are very, very robust for us. Japan has been remarkably strong. China remains strong. But it's very, very mixed and it's very, very case-by-case specific, certainly, that there are overhangs. I think sequestration, the impact on DoD, I think, is pretty clear, and I don't think we have escaped that. Overall, GDP growth being negative in the U.S., but some industries, like financial services, are struggling. Other ones, oil and gas or our consumer, have actually been a little bit stronger on the IT side. So I think it's very, very mixed. I don't think there's one geography that's successful across the board. And even within the more active vertical markets, it's really a story around successful players are less successful players. If I had to generalize, I would say certainly no improvement is probably the best I can say at this point.","Operator","And we have Mark Moscowitz with JPMorgan on line with a question.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Tom, the question is really around consistency. Clearly, you put together now a string of quarters where your operating metrics have been more consistent. There still seem to be, though, if we look at it from a stock perspective since we're all stock analysts here on the call, there seems to be skepticism still, your stock is still below where it was trading a year ago despite your revenue and operating model now getting back to similar levels. And you seem to be projecting a little more optimism around your book of business. And also, you got new products coming, more new products coming down the pipe. Can you just kind of talk more about what has changed to allow NetApp to get back to this point, this consistency? And how should we think about the next step function up, is it really just driven by new products? Or have you done anything internally around either your sales force infrastructure or global support to be a little more direct in line of sight in terms of working with your customers better?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think that as far as the stock price, that's going to be derived from our performance. And so our focus is executing on the performance and delivering the results every day. The other message, to the extent that there's a dramatic message to the team is that the macro is the macro, it's everybody's problem and there's nothing we're going to do about that. We need to focus on the things that we can control. We need to focus on innovation. We need to focus on expanding our partnerships and our alliances. And if I look at the hard work that we've done around that, it's great to see the clustered ONTAP adoption. That's the biggest innovation in our history. It's great to see the momentum around that because it's a big differentiator. And when that's fully deployed and people really see the value of it, and now that we've gotten a substantial amount of the functionality there that people can derive tremendous value on that today, we like that. And likewise, we've got other things on the way. You'll see a Flash announcement from us very, very soon, the use of E-Series as an all-Flash array and shipped 100 units last quarter, pending growth of Branded E-Series. So if I look at where we are today, I think there's a lot of nascent growth opportunities. Clearly, we need to ultimately execute. But I'd say that clustered ONTAP is in the early days of impacting NetApp's business. E-Series is in the early days of impacting NetApp business. We're going to ship Flash Accel this quarter. We're going to make a Flash announcement in the near future. So I think there's some pending growth things. So for us, focus on that innovation piece. You've seen publicly what we've done around alliances, around recent announcements with Cisco, around Citrix, around SAP. Clearly broadening the appeal of our products integrates highly with other solutions. And then internally, we talked about the OpEx story, is that how do we be very, very, very focused on execution across every aspect of the business? So it's a time for focus, it's a time for intensity. It's not a time when there's a big investment envelope, and just focus on the things that we can control. And the message to the team is, is that independent of the macro, if we execute on things that we can do on all of these fronts, then NetApp can drive consistency, do what we say we're going to do and drive out performance in this industry whether the macro rebounds or not. And that's really our focus.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Georgens for final remarks.","Thomas Georgens","Okay. Well, first of all, thank you very much for your time today. We appreciate your interest in NetApp, and we look forward to seeing you in, roughly, 90 days.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Hello. Thank you for joining us on our Q3 fiscal year 2017 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and our CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com, along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter, and our expectations regarding future revenue growth, improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections.","Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and IT spending environments, and our ability to successfully innovate in the growth areas of the market, gain market share, expand our operating margin, reduce our cost structure and continue our capital allocation strategy.","Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q, our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2016, and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated.","I'll now turn the call over to George.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We executed well in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, again delivering solid results with revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range and both operating margin and earnings per share above our guidance.","Our innovation in emerging areas of the market is expanding and creating new growth opportunities for us. In the quarter, we strengthened our industry-leading portfolio with the introduction of new all-flash arrays and hybrid cloud solutions, positioning us to address a growing set of customer use cases. With focus and disciplined execution, we are successfully innovating to meet the evolving needs of our growing customer base while at the same time streamlining our business.","As we deliver on our commitment to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, we remain focused on three priorities. First, our Data Fabric platform and the strategic solutions that are built for the opportunities of a data-centric world. Second, lowering our cost structure and streamlining operations while maintaining our ability to innovate. And third, a robust capital allocation program, which includes the mix of share buybacks, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business.","I'll begin with an update on our first priority. Ron will update you on the other two. Our strategic solutions position us to lead in the new era of IT. These flash-enabled, cloud-integrated offerings provide customers with the future proof solutions required for success in a data-centric world. In Q3, strategic solutions constituted 65% of net product revenue, up 22% year-over-year. Net product revenue from our mature solutions declined 18% year-over-year.","As we've said in the past, the headwinds from mature solutions will lessen, allowing the growth of the strategic solutions to return the company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. Consistent with the plan we've laid out and as you saw in our Q3 results and Q4 guidance included in our press release, the momentum of our strategic solutions is already delivering top line growth.","Customers are maximizing the value of their data by prioritizing investments to modernize the data centers, increase agility, and integrate cloud resources with on-premises environments. Clustered ONTAP allows customers to modernize their infrastructure by replacing stand-alone silos of storage and monolithic frame arrays with a scale-out, software-defined shared storage platform.","Uniquely in the storage industry, Clustered ONTAP enables seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk and public and private cloud footprints for enterprise applications with the ability to consolidate multiple workloads into a single repository for improved efficiency.","Clustered ONTAP continues to perform very well. We are gaining new customers, expanding our footprint with existing customers and successfully migrating our install base. In Q3, Clustered ONTAP was deployed on over 90% of FAS systems shipped. Unit shipments of Clustered ONTAP systems grew 24% year-over-year, and the install base of FAS systems continues to grow. And Clustered ONTAP is now running on approximately 40% of systems in that large and growing install base.","Additionally, we reached an exciting milestone this quarter which underscores the momentum we've had with Clustered ONTAP. Clustered ONTAP now manages over 50% of the FAS system capacity in our install base.","Flash is the mainstream choice for new on-premises deployments as customers seek to lower total cost of ownership while gaining greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications. NetApp leads the industry in the transition to flash with cloud-integrated solutions that provide unrivaled efficiency, speed, scale and data management. Per IDC's calendar Q4, all-flash array market data, we strengthened our number two position. And our growth in flash continues to outpace both the market and our competition, large and small.","Although NAND supply is tight, we are confident in our ability to meet demand and we expect our share gains to continue. In our third quarter, our all-flash array business grew 160% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of almost $1.4 billion, inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF, and SolidFire product and services.","The majority of our all-flash array business is driven by Clustered ONTAP, deployed at both FAS engineered systems and FlexPod converged infrastructure solutions. This year, we have refreshed our entire all-flash FAS portfolio with the A-Series designed specifically for flash and are experiencing strong adoption of these new products. The A-Series all-flash systems deliver industry-leading performance, capacity, scalability, security and network connectivity in dense form factors.","In Q3, we introduced a new entry-level system which extends enterprise-grade flash to midsize businesses. At the start of Q4, we announced a new high-end system which continues NetApp's track record for innovation with an NVMe fabric-ready clustered architecture. We also enhanced our storage efficiency capabilities and introduced an industry-leading workload-specific guarantee that scales to a 5-to-1 data reduction ratio.","The beginning of February marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of SolidFire. SolidFire creates an avenue of growth for us to address customers' data requirements as they build out next-generation data centers. We are growing the SolidFire business through the expanded reach of NetApp, acquiring new customers, introducing SolidFire into existing NetApp accounts and bringing NetApp solutions to SolidFire customers.","We are further leveraging our SolidFire investment and expanding our growth potential by developing the next generation of hyper-converged infrastructure built on SolidFire innovation. We will do what has not yet been done by the immature first generation of hyper-converged solutions, bringing hyper-converged infrastructure to the enterprise by allowing customers the flexibility to run multiple workloads without compromising performance, scale or efficiency.","As part of the data fabric platform, it will also be the first fully cloud-integrated ACI solution, giving customers the ability to leverage their data across on-premises, public cloud and hybrid cloud environments. With this innovation, we further broaden our industry-leading portfolio with cloud-integrated solutions available in stand-alone, converged, hyper-converged and software-defined offerings. We will have more information on the development of this exciting new solution for you in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.","The NetApp data fabric enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate systems, software stacks, clouds and data centers. This allows customers to architect the IT environment that best meets their needs, utilizing a mix of flash, disk and public and private cloud resources. IT organizations can be more responsive to the needs of the business by leveraging the scale of on-demand cloud capabilities while maintaining data visibility with a single consistent view of data and infrastructure across clouds and on-premises resources.","We continue innovating in this space, and at the start of the third quarter announced new data fabric services. These as-a-service and consumption-based offerings allow customers to control, manage, secure and move data across on-premises and public cloud resources. By providing data portability and cloud integration, we are increasing our strategic relevance and expanding our opportunity.","Customers and cloud service providers are choosing NetApp because we enable their hybrid cloud strategies. A large U.S.-based insurance company chose NetApp Private Storage for cloud to leverage the elasticity of the cloud to spin up or down computer network as needed for quantitative research and analysis while keeping full control of their data.","A large North American-based retailer selected NetApp all-flash FAS to replace its legacy EMC SAN infrastructure because we solved their current application integration, replication and management challenges with a compelling path to hybrid cloud.","At a cloud-based talent management solution provider, we displaced over 1 petabyte of legacy EMC and HP storage for the company's production and disaster recovery environments. Our cloud integration and the ability to scale with their business were key factors in the customer's decision for NetApp.","Ron will go into depth about cost savings and capital allocation, and I want to re-emphasize our commitment to both priorities. We're helping customers transform their businesses for success in the data-powered digital era by enabling their efforts to modernize their infrastructure, build next-generation data centers and harness the power of the hybrid cloud. With our powerful portfolio of innovative solutions and data fabric strategy, we have enormous opportunity to lead in this next year of IT.","I remain extremely confident in our ability to successfully execute against this opportunity. The transformation of NetApp is yielding results and has changed the trajectory of our business. We have a sharp focus on delivering innovation to address an expanding range of customer requirements in the fastest-growing parts of the market, while lowering our cost structure and streamlining the business.","We've improved our agility and are delivering innovation at an accelerated pace. With continued execution, we're on track to increase shareholder value and return the company to long-term growth and to our target operating margin range.","We will hold an Investor Day in New York on April 5, where we will share more detail on the evolution of NetApp to lead in the data-powered digital era, as well as our multi-year business outlook. We hope that you'll be able to join us.","I'll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q3 financial performance and expectations for Q4. Ron?","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today, unless otherwise noted.","Q3 marked another strong quarter with net revenues hitting the midpoint of guidance. Net revenues were $1.4 billion, an increase of 5% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. Product revenue of $784 million increased over 10% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. As George highlighted, the strength of our strategic solutions drove overall product revenue growth. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue was $620 million, relatively flat sequentially and down slightly on a year-over-year basis.","Gross margin was at the low end of our guidance range at 61.5%, reflecting higher excess and obsolete reserves due to faster than anticipated adoption of our latest platforms and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange headwind. Product gross margin of 45.7% decreased about 2.5 points sequentially and 5.5 points year-over-year.","Software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased about 4 points sequentially and 5.5 points year-over-year, directly attributable to our ongoing transformation efforts.","Operating expenses of $579 million decreased 9% sequentially and 8% year-over-year, and were below our Q3 guidance due in part to variable compensation and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange benefit. As a result, operating margin of 20.2% was above our guidance range. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.6%, an increase of over 1 point sequentially, reflecting a higher mix of U.S. profits as transformation benefits were slightly disproportionate to the U.S.","Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 281 million. Earnings per share of $0.82 was $0.05 over the high-end of our guidance range, a result of higher operating profit and lower diluted share count.","Our cash and balance sheet metrics remain healthy. We closed Q3 with $4.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, with 11% held by our domestic entities. In Q3, we repurchased $284 million of our stock and paid $52 million in cash dividends. We remain committed to completing the share repurchase program that we outlined in February, 2015. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which will be paid on April 26, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 7, 2017.","Deferred and financed unearned services revenue was up 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Q3 cash flow from operations was $235 million, an increase of 49% sequentially. However, on a year-over-year basis, cash flow from operations was down $120 million.","Although GAAP net income was comparable in Q3 FY 2016 and Q3 FY 2017, we had higher levels of inventory and accounts receivable this quarter. Accounts receivable grew in the quarter due to higher revenue and linearity in the quarter. Inventory grew due to timing associated with specific deals, as well as an increase in evaluation units for all-flash FAS and SolidFire.","We generated free cash flow of $190 million, a decrease of 39% year-over-year. Our cash conversion cycle is 17 days, which was an improvement of nine days on a year-over-year basis, but eight days longer sequentially. Again, these metrics reflect higher accounts receivable and inventory, partially offset by higher accounts payable. As George said, we're confident in our ability to meet demand in flash. So we have cured enough NAND to meet the anticipated demand for the remainder of the fiscal year.","Now, to guidance. Our transformation efforts are yielding results. NetApp is stronger, more focused and more agile. We remain committed to executing against the plans we've outlined for you. For Q4, we expect a revenue range of $1.365 billion to $1.515 billion. We expect consolidated gross margins of approximately 60% to 62%. The gross margin range incorporates some conservatism due to NAND cost increases. We expect operating margins of approximately 18.5% to 19.5%.","As we announced in Q3 a year ago, we're reducing our cost structure across both cost of sales and OpEx by $400 million gross, annualized by the end of fiscal 2017. We are reinvesting some of the savings into strategic opportunities. And based on our Q4 guidance, we are overachieving our committed net run rate savings of $130 million exiting this year. Finally, we expect earnings per share for the fourth quarter to range from approximately $0.79 to $0.84 per share.","With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","We'll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thank you for your cooperation.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question. So your all-flash revenue growth accelerated this quarter. One of the reasons we're hearing that you're getting wins within your install base is because customers prefer not to retrain their staff on a new operating system when they moved to all-flash. So I guess have you seen any changes in your win rates within your install base? And then, can you provide any color around the percentage of existing customers that are still not yet running in all-flash array?","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","Our success in all-flash arrays is broad and wide. We have net new customers, we have new workloads within our existing customers, and upgrades within our install base. I would tell you that the net new customers and new workloads are materially bigger as a percentage of our all-flash business, reflected, for example, in the market share gains we're seeing in the SAN business, rather than our traditional install base. As percentage of our install base, all-flash FAS is a very small percentage. It's less than 10% of the deployed install base. So we've got lots of headroom to go.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just want to get a little sense here in terms of how much of some of the momentum in your revenue base is being driven by some of the disruption at some of your other competitors versus just you guys having a much better product set than a year ago? And then, Ron, I know you did talk about the gross margin profile, but just wanted to get a sense here if there's any more details you can share with us in terms of why the product revenue margin is a little lighter relative to our expectations, but the services margin much better? Thank you.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","Let me take the first question. We are seeing momentum both because we have a compellingly differentiated product set. As we have noted, the all-flash market is now going from early adopter to the mainstream market where customers are moving entire disk-based estates over to solid-state and therefore require the full range of features in their all-flash arrays from a business process, from a data management protection and availability perspective.","Both all-flash FAS, as well as SolidFire give customers a compellingly differentiated platform; and the EF-Series is the fastest performing box in the industry. I think, in addition, we are clearly seeing disarray at our competitors. Our leading competitors, neither have the flagship flash product, as well as going through substantial challenges from an integration perspective. And customers are looking to NetApp to give them a path forward for their all-flash estates, as well as to the hybrid cloud. Ron?","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","So, Mark, I think what we've tried to intimate is on the services side there is \u2013 that's what represents quite a bit of our transformation efforts. It's not just OpEx. So we've done a lot of work to increase the margins on the services business. On the product side what I mentioned, quarter to quarter the only unexpected variance was E&O [excess and obsolete] due to a faster than anticipated product transition. As we move to Q4, in the guide, there's a little bit of headwind for a flash COGS increase.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Mark. And just a reminder to everyone, please limit yourself to one question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks for the question. Just following up on that, could you just expand a little bit more on your product gross margin outlook maybe beyond this quarter? You mentioned some NAND costs and like you addressed the reserves. So as those reserves sort of grandfather along and your mix sort of continues to improve towards flash, how do we think about longer term product gross margin potential?","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","I'm going to save that answer for our April 5 investor meeting. I'll give you quite a better view of next year and probably a little longer term. It's not something I feel comfortable guiding with right now.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Okay. Since we're passing on that, could I just ask a quick one then, in terms of \u2013 you mentioned on the competitive environment. Can you give us a little more color then on the competitive environment within all-flash arrays? How rational do you think it is versus your expectations, or any other color would be helpful? Thanks.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","I think, first of all, in the competitive landscape, things have not changed substantially. As we said, the major competitor that we go up for the majority of the deals are the large system manufacturers, most notably EMC and the other high-end SAN arrays that we are displacing with all-flash FAS. HP has always been the low-price leader, and they lack the feature set in terms of data management services. So they compete aggressively on price. And the startups are increasingly challenged to differentiate themselves, and so you see evidence of desperation from various different smaller startup players. I'll just leave it there.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Steve. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. If we could just dig into some of the other strategic areas, obviously, the all-flash piece grew pretty aggressively in the quarter. It looks like some of the other pieces of that which you break out in the strategic line are down fairly meaningfully year-over-year. Could you just talk a little bit about what's going on there? Is it cannibalization? What's driving the downside to the other part of strategic? Thanks.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","Overall, strategic products were up 22% year-on-year, so we saw really strong growth. In terms of the strategic numbers, it's only product revenue that comprises the strategic number. Our all-flash array number includes products and services, right?","I think when you think about all-flash versus hybrid flash arrays, I mean, they're essentially solutions we offer customers. Some customers, for their workloads, choose all-flash solutions and some customers choose hybrid solutions. We have a unique advantage in the market that we are able to offer customers choice with the same set of data management capabilities. So if the price of NAND rises unexpectedly, we can always offer them a hybrid solution which no one else in the market can offer.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Tim. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jayson Noland of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. I wanted to ask on NVMe, George. It sounds like a big deal, but I'd love to get your perspective from a timing and NetApp positioning perspective?","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","We have NVMe support in the flash arrays that we introduced to market, so the flat FAS9000, the 8200, 2600 series all have NVMe integrated onboard for a low latency cash. We also have in the A700s a NVMe over fabric ready architecture.","NVMe will become just like fiber channel. It'll take time to get adopted and become deployable widely at customers as a true storage solution. We're working with the industry to make that available, and it will become part of every platform. I don't think there is meaningful differentiation from NVMe. I think, as I've said continuously, proven data management capabilities, integration in the application domain, and delivering business value will be the composition with customers. NVMe will become a check box that all of us will have, us included.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Jayson. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. George, I want to ask you just a high-level action around the cost savings, because the OpEx level that you're running at now you haven't been there since 2011 when the revenue run rate was about 7% lower. So can you talk about some of the areas where the company is able to be more efficient than it was at different revenue levels, especially given that the product portfolio has expanded and the competitive landscape is arguably more intense than five years or so. And then, just as you look going forward, how do you think about balancing opportunities for additional cost savings versus starting to reinvest more of that to ensure that you can maintain the growth that you put up this quarter? Thank you.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","First of all, in terms of the cost savings that we have taken on, it's a transformation across all aspects of the business. I would say in the product portfolio, it is to leverage the capabilities that the supply chain has to not only meaningfully reduce the cost of introducing new hardware platforms, but actually accelerate the pace at which we are introducing new hardware platforms. The recent lineup of FAS hardware platforms were introduced at 3 times lower cost of introduction and three 3 faster. So we're substantially better in terms of the way we build systems and hardware.","The second is in terms of our shared services environments, we've consolidated the operations of many of our back end functions into a shared services platform. There's continuing work to be done to complete that transition, but that offers promise of not only savings for this year, but in years to come by being much more efficient. Things like reporting, payroll administration, various elements of human resources and so on will be delivered from a centralized shared services facility rather than close to the employees, giving us both consistency and operating leverage.","And in the go-to-market area, as you can see, the work that we have done, particularly in the services business, have materially improved the profitability of that line. We've integrated, for example, self-service support, online chat as opposed to human support. And you'll see us integrating advances in machine learning so that customers can both get better satisfaction, but at a lower cost. So we remain committed to doing that.","As we think about the savings that we generate, we'll continue to look at all of the options that are in front of us, right? Returning some of that through improved profitability to shareholders, as well as investing in the long-term growth of the business. One of the meaningful areas that we've invested in is SolidFire. And you can see, we're not only leveraging that investment in the all-flash array segment, but to deliver a compellingly differentiated hyper-converged offering to the market.","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","Katy, you should think of transformation as not an event; it's something we're going to do ongoing. And we'll talk about that more on the April 5 meeting.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Katy. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thank you. First, just a quick clarification. I wasn't clear if OpEx is now at a bottom and will build up from here, or at least stabilize, or do you still expect it to go down? And then, the question I had was on hardware maintenance which came in a bit short of our and consensus expectations. If you can just give us some insight into what drove that and how you see it going forward?","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","Yeah. Let me take the second question first. So, first of all, our install base and our FAS install base continues to grow. We need to exclude PS and training. Maintenance is only down 1% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter. We are starting to see some ASP declines that we're passing on, basically better pricing, as a result of our transformation savings. Coupled with that, we are seeing asset lives extend to five years and beyond which explains the growth in deferred revenue and more specifically long-term deferred revenue. And as product revenue continues to grow, this will lead to service revenues growing again.","With respect to OpEx, if you impute the guide I gave for Q4, there is some seasonality upward. And, again, I'm not going to guide next year, but we still have work to do on our cost structure. So I'll just leave it at that.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks. Just a question on your OpEx outperformance. Throughout the first three quarters of the fiscal year, you've developed a pretty consistent pattern where gross profit dollars are very close to the midpoint of the ranges, which is great. But then your OpEx is substantially lower, roughly $20 million a quarter below the implied guide. So what is that dynamic driving that consistent beat? I know you quickly referenced lower variable comp this quarter. Is there anything kind of...","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","There were a lot of different pieces. The combination of variable comp and FX is only half of the variance. There's a ton of other little things that added up. I would just say that, you're right, year-to-date, we're consistently under spending. I think that points to the culture we're changing around OpEx management and transformation.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks. And the rest my question was that, does your same methodology kind of apply to the April quarter guide? Thank you.","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","I did the best job I can of the guide, so there's no games being played here.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. I was just curious, when you talk about install base numbers, are you talking about number of systems, number of customers? And how does the rate of change today compare to, say, two years ago?","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","It's the number of systems under contract. Two years ago \u2013 I still think we have more systems under contract than even two years. It's probably at an all-time high right now. In fact, it is.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Was the install base growing at a similar rate or faster two years ago?","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","I think the install base of units is growing at a faster rate now. I think in terms of the systems, life cycle continues to expand, right? So I think the continued extension of life cycle is what causes the install base to have legs and growth, right, in addition to the product revenue growth that we're seeing now, so.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Maynard J. Um - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. In the past, you've typically passed along the cost of media price increases or price declines to customers. But based on your product gross margin conservatism commentary, has something changed in your ability to pass along those costs? And any color on when NAND pricing should start to decline and be a tailwind for you? Thanks.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","Okay. Let me take the first one, and Ron will take the second. I think in terms of our approach to media prices, we've generally taken the position that we will pass on whatever cost structure being offered to us, benefit or disadvantage, from the media manufacturers to our customers. I think the caution is really reflecting the dynamic nature of SSD availability and pricing. As we noted, we've put in place the capability to meet a short supply. We're wanting to guarantee a short supply to our end customers, and that has been a priority ahead of specific pricing agreements.","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","And from what we can tell, obviously, this is somewhat an estimate, supply will be tight for the rest of the summer, probably should ease later in the calendar year is what we're thinking. And prices should come back a little bit better later in the calendar year as well.","Maynard J. Um - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Maynard.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. I was hoping you'd be able to help us quantify the headwind from the NAND in terms of how much pressure it's putting on the gross margins. And then, help me understand why your product gross margins traditionally have been lower versus some of your peers. I imagine it's a little bit of apples-to-apples, but help me set the baseline with that? Thank you.","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","Yeah. So in the guide for Q4, I'd say, there's probably a headwind of about a half a point in total gross margin erosion. About seven ticks is SSD COGS increase to some extent. I think if you look at our history of gross margin, it has vacillated over the years. I think it's something we do need to focus on. And the good news is we've offset that with a lot of the increase in the service margins.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Simon. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just had two. Well, I wanted to clarify one thing and then I have a question, I guess. The clarification is, can you guys just say \u2013 you're saying that you've got NAND supply into, I guess, the April quarter. Do you have it on through July or have you only guaranteed it for one quarter forward? Because it sounds like October and January quarters, probably the supply, you think, is going to be back to decent again.","And then, my question is, the Dell EMC channel deal that was announced a couple of weeks ago, I guess it started at the beginning of February, can you just comment on whether you're seeing impact from that in the channel? Do you have to make any changes in your own channel program? And how lucrative is this relative to your existing channel program? Thanks.","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","So with respect to NAND, we've secured supply for the remainder of this calendar year, at which point I don't think this is going to be an issue anymore from a supply standpoint.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","From a channel program perspective, we've started to see the beginnings of an integrated channel program from EMC. I'll just tell you that incentives are just a small part of the total value proposition that a channel partner looks for from their supplier. I think the competitiveness of the product portfolio, the fact that we enable our channel partners to have a rich base of margin-rich services associated with the business that they're doing with NetApp continues to make us a compelling value proposition to our partners. So we're going to continue to attack with the full breadth of our channel, and we are making progress as our results note.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. I just had two accounting clarifications. It seems like the strategic solutions revenue changed slightly, historically, and versus last quarter. So can you just explain what moved into the different buckets? And then, it looks like amortization ticked up. Can you explain why amortization went up? Thanks.","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","So we did make one adjustment to historical strategic for one product that we had accounted for incorrectly. We're experimenting with what's called Express Packs, and that didn't get counted in strategic in the past three (41:08) quarters. So we made one adjustment.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","They are solutions that are fixed configurations of our Clustered ONTAP and all-flash FAS products that make it easy for the channel to procure, and we did include that in a couple of the past quarters. So there's a slight adjustment for that. The second question was on amortization.","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","There's a slight increase in SolidFire amortization for new developed technologies. It's pretty small.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Sherri.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street Capital. Your line is now open.","Eric Martinuzzi - Lake Street Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. I was just comparing the international, the mix versus a year ago. It looks pretty consistent there. Do you see that sustaining? And could you comment, specifically, on EMEA and APAC?","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","We have a broad book of business around the world. I would just tell you our book of business is affected by GDP outlook, as well as the competitiveness of our portfolio and execution against those opportunities. We didn't notice any specific change in pattern through the course of the quarter across the broad base of geographies that we serve.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Eric.","Eric Martinuzzi - Lake Street Capital Markets LLC","Do you expect that \u2013 okay.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","Yeah. We expect the trend to continue the same.","Eric Martinuzzi - Lake Street Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Irvin Liu - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. This is Irvin Liu calling in for Amit. So on your flash business, given that flash is currently running at a $1.4 billion annual run rate, are you guys seeing the margin profile for flash improve versus your mature business? And if so, how should we think about flash array margins, versus disk, or versus hybrid?","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","You shouldn't think of a different margin profile between strategic and mature. They're relatively the same. And I think that's also true with flash, hybrid and traditional spinning disk.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Lucia of JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","John A. Lucia - JMP Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to see if you guys could give us an update on the spending environment in storage, in general? It seems like things have improved over the last couple quarters in terms of the way you're discussing the market. Have you seen sales cycles shorten or are customers more decisive in their spending? Any kind of color would be great.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","I think through the course of the quarter, we saw a strong year-end budget flush. We saw January return to fairly normal patterns of uncertainty across the geographies that we serve and saw linearity similar to normal sort of back end loaded quarters, right? I think in terms of the segments of the market that we serve, I think our pivot is targeting the faster growing parts of the market. So there's a lot more interest as a share of wallet for the technologies that we're offering today, like solid-state, next-generation data centers, object storage, as well as what we're thinking about delivering to market in the hyper-converged space.","I think in terms of traditional environments, you continue to see people sweat assets trying to get longer lifecycles out of that. We're benefiting from the fact that we've got a differentiated portfolio. We're benefiting from the fact that the portfolio is targeting the places where customers are spending. And, frankly, we're benefiting from the fact that Clustered ONTAP significantly and substantially transforms the cost structure for legacy frame array. We can go in there at an order of magnitude greater efficiency and enable lots more software features than they've historically had.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, John.","John A. Lucia - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia of CLSA. Your line is now open.","Louis Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC","Hey, George. Sort of on that same line, but looking at a little bit more into the future. Some very big companies like Verizon, GE, Cap One, all look to close their data centers. Maybe could you give us some thoughts on the trajectory for the next two, or three, or four years of storage, in general? Because obviously you've got a very nice quarter here, so congratulations on that. But just worried if you're running off of a weak compare; in that, when you sort of get to the actual year-over-year compare, it either flattens or goes down.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","We'll give you more details of the long-term outlook at our Analyst Conference. I can just tell you that we are increasingly seeing wins where people are using NetApp Private Storage solutions connected to public cloud providers. And what we've always said is we anticipate returning the company to moderated revenue growth. Our focus on transformation allows that moderated revenue growth to generate substantial returns to shareholders, and we're delivering on that commitment right now.","Louis Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Lou.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian White of Drexel. Your line is now open.","Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Yeah. George, I know you came in here at NetApp as CEO in mid-2015. The company was going through a lot of issues at that time. You've really righted the ship and done a phenomenal job here. What's the next big thing that we should think about that will move the needle for NetApp? And do you think NetApp will gain share over the next few years? Thank you.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","I think if you look at our results today, we are gaining share in the markets that we serve. In the all-flash array market, there's no question we're growing faster than competitors, big and small. I think if you look at the storage and device management market, we took over the number one position from EMC in that market. We've made solid progress in Clustered ONTAP in terms of transitioning our install base, and are doing so with greater operating margin leverage.","As we indicated on the call, we are working on a next-generation hyper-converged solution which we think will allow us to do to the hyper-converged market what we did to the all-flash array market: serve the needs of mainstream customers with a platform that's differentiated with performance, enterprise data management capabilities, and hybrid cloud integration. We think that's what the market wants. And we're focused and going to be delivering that, and you'll see us make some exciting announcements early next fiscal year.","Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Great. Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. George, building on that last comment, I'm just curious of how you currently see the hyper-converged market. Have you seen it compete at all relative to your traditional FAS systems? Or as you push into this market, how do we think about it from being an adjacent or incremental opportunity for NetApp to go after?","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","It isn't a net new market that we serve. It will allow us to serve the system or virtualization administrator at customers rather than the storage administrators. The hyper-converged market today is sort of a first-generation solution. The solutions don't have enterprise data management features. They have challenges with performance consistency, which requires them to become a single workload configuration and are, therefore, addressing the low-end market, the departmental market. There are few solutions that can really serve anything broader than that market.","What we're trying to bring to customers, just like we did in the all-flash array market, is a solution that allows customers the benefits of ease of administration, but with the unique benefits of performance and scalability, enterprise data management and hybrid cloud integration, which really gives us a net new market to address.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Aaron.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini. Thanks so much for taking my question. Some of your smaller emerging competitors use a third-party for system hardware procurement, which appears to be an enabler for higher product gross margin. Is this a potential avenue for you to explore? And it seems like SolidFire does this. Any comment around the potential for this to expand across your core product portfolio? Thanks so much.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","As I've said, as part of our transformation efforts we have continued to leverage the supply chain, the industry supply chain, to build technology for us.

And then, so when you look at just the direction of your product gross margin over the last couple of years, apart from the memory cost maybe rises, has it just been the lack of scale that's been driving that down and pricing pressure into the wrong portfolio, and that corrects itself? Is that how we should think about it?","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","Yeah, mostly. I mean, I've talked about this before. It's mostly discounting. That's what most of the margin erosion is from.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","We've had also been running promotions to get our customer base transitioned from 7-Mode to Clustered ONTAP. As we announced this quarter, those promotions \u2013 we've transitioned 50% of the capacity in our install base to Clustered ONTAP, and so we're seriously evaluating whether we need to continue those promotions.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And so, would you say we're near the trough on gross margins, then?","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","I'd like to think so. Again, what I've said before is, we still want to be competitive. So we're trying to do that in a balanced way, and it's hard to know. I wouldn't want them to go any lower. But, again, we've got to be competitive.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thank you, Kulbinder.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from George Iwanyc of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","George Iwanyc - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you for taking my question. Following up on the promotion and discounting comments that you just made, are those being competitively driven, are there secular pressures that have forced those for the most part?","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","They're in response to competitive, especially the promotions. And one of them was unique to us, which George mentioned; and some of the other ones are in response to competitive.","George Iwanyc - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Could you see the market normalizing on that front?","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","Yeah. And, again, we'll talk more about this when I give the outlook for next year in April, but that would be the thinking.","George Iwanyc - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned operating expenses that you appear to be ahead of goal, progressing much faster. Can you help us, as we look ahead, does the goal move higher, is it you're getting the expenses benefit sooner and we shouldn't project even more savings because now products are doing well? How should we think about the goals and where you're at, because you are ahead of that goal? Thank you very much.","Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.","Yeah. The goal we established was last year, and we said from Q3 2016 to this going out rate of Q4 2017 we'd save a gross $400 million. And then, after some strategic investments, which includes SolidFire, it'd be a net of $130 million. If you impute my guide for OpEx, you can almost get there on an annualized rate between Q3 OpEx of 2016 annualized and the guide I gave for Q4. You can almost get to the whole $130 million. And when you add the savings associated with the services work we've done, you can more than get there. We haven't guided anything beyond that at this point. But, as I said, transformation will still exist as we go forward.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Rich Kugele of Needham and Company. Your line is now open.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good evening. George, if we're going to look at the case study of the all-flash FAS progression, clearly innovating from the ground up with all your feature set, as well as supplemented by acquisitions was the right approach, ultimately. Now, with hyper-converged, you really seem to be trying to go and leverage what you had acquired with SolidFire. And what can we tell investors to give them comfort that this would be the right approach as opposed to what happened with the all-flash?","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","I think in both of those cases, our perspective is the long-term winner, as we have demonstrated in the all-flash array market, is the one that can take an architecture and serve the mainstream customer segment. There have been lots of companies that have gone after the early-adopter segment with a subset of the features that enterprise customers really want and have failed in the long run. And so, first to market doesn't necessarily mean the big winner, right?","I think what we are trying to do with the hyper-converged segment is the same track record that we've demonstrated with the all-flash array segment, which is customers want mature enterprise data management features. They want performance consistency and scalability, so that they don't have to have operationally a siloed environment. And hybrid cloud is really the architecture of the data center going forward, and they want true hybrid cloud integration. And so, we think that by offering those capabilities to customers, we will redefine the hyper-converged market just like we did to the all-flash array market.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","Stay tuned.","Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.","Thanks, Rich.","George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.","The transformation of NetApp is yielding solid results with the return to top line growth and increasing profitability. We're expanding our opportunity by addressing an increasing range of strategic customer use cases. We've completely refreshed our portfolio of hybrid and all-flash arrays, delivered an industry-leading storage efficiency guarantee to the market, expanding our cloud-based services, and soon we will introduce a next-generation Hyper converged solution. All of this underpins our growing confidence in the future. We hope to see you in April at our investor event where we will talk more about the evolution of NetApp to lead in the next era of IT.

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Kris Newton, you may begin.","Kris Newton","","Hello and thank you for joining us on our Q4 fiscal year 2014 earnings call. With me today are CEO, Tom Georgens; and our CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our Web site at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2015, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections.","Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We described some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on the Form 8-K. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2013, subsequent Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our current reports on Form 8-K also on file with the SEC and available on our Web site.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks and on our Web site.","In a moment, Nick will walk you through some additional color on our financial results, and then Tom will give you his perspective on the business this quarter.","I'll now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Noviello","","Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. NetApp delivered another quarter of solid financial performance, driven by our innovative portfolio solutions, competitive positioning and strong operational execution. We achieved Q4 revenue inside our prior guidance range and non-GAAP gross margin, operating margin and EPS all above Q4 guidance ranges.","Before discussing our fiscal 2014 results and future expectations, I'd like to first provide more detail on our performance in the fourth quarter. Net revenues of $1.65 billion were up 2% sequentially, but down 4% year-over-year.","Branded revenue grew 6% sequentially, and as expected was relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. OEM revenue declined further than expected and was down 30% from Q3 and 34% from Q4 last year. Indirect revenues through the channels and OEMs accounted for 83% of Q4 revenue consistent with the last two quarters. Arrow and Avnet contributed 24% and 17% of net revenue respectively.","Non-GAAP gross margin of 64.4% was almost a point better than Q3 and above our previous guidance. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 58% was up almost one point sequentially and two points year-over-year due to a combination of continued operational productivity, favorable product mix and lower hardware warranty costs.","Non-GAAP service gross margin of 62.7% was up almost two points sequentially and more than six points year-over-year due to higher support revenue and lower spending partially related to delayed projects as well as lower headcounts related to realignment actions.","Non-GAAP operating margin of 20.9% was above our previous guidance range driven by a combination of higher gross margins and lower operating expenses resulting from the realignment action we took mid quarter. We made the realignment decision to accelerate key strategic initiatives, while at the same time streamlining certain elements of the business such as OEM.","Overall, this action resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 4% and a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $39 million in the quarter.","Non-GAAP EPS of $0.84 was up 22% year-over-year and was $0.02 over the high-end of our prior guidance range. This reflects solid operational performance as well as an approximate $0.01 net benefit from the combination of realignment activities and lower share counts, partially offset by a higher Q4 effective tax rate versus prior guidance.","Q4 weighted average diluted share counts of 336 million shares decreased by almost 10 million shares from Q3 due to repurchase activity throughout the quarter.","Cash and balance sheet metrics for Q4 remains strong. Free cash flow of $313 million was 19% of net revenue. Inventory turns were at 19 and days sales outstanding increased to 47, reflecting typical seasonality. Deferred revenue was up $141 million versus Q3 and up $91 million from Q4 last year. Finally, we repurchased approximately $374 million of stock and paid $49 million in cash dividend during the quarter.","Now turning to fiscal year 2014, I would characterize the year in much the same way as I characterize Q4. Solid financial performance based on innovation leadership, robust operational execution and strong competitive positioning. Throughout the year we introduced new solutions that enable customers to solve their challenges today while providing them with an innovative architecture for tomorrow.","For the fiscal year, net revenues of $6.33 billion were flat from fiscal year 2013. Branded revenue was up 4% that was offset by lower OEM revenue, which was down 26%. Including the impact of lower OEM revenue, geographic revenues in EMEA and Asia-Pacific were up slightly, offset by lower revenue in the Americas, which was due to challenges in U.S. Federal spending.","Full year non-GAAP gross margin was 63.2%, up 2.5 points from fiscal 2013, and non-GAAP operating margin was 18.3%, up three points from fiscal 2013.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 17.2%, slightly above our prior guidance and fiscal 2013, reflecting the impact of our geographical sales mix and year end true-ups. Non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2014 was $2.78, up 22% from fiscal year 2013.","We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and a continued high degree of financial flexibility to invest in the business and enhanced value of the shareholders. We closed fiscal 2014 with approximately $5 billion in cash in short-term investments, approximately 14% of which is onshore.","Over the course of the year we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow and fully executed our capital allocation strategy, which included retiring just under $1.3 billion in convertible notes and returning $2.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. As expected, we ended this fiscal year with approximately $1.1 billion remaining in our share repurchase program.","Today we are pleased to announce an increase in our next dividend to $0.165 per share to be paid on July 22. This represents a 10% increase compared to Q4 and reflects our confidence in the business, our consistent ability to generate healthy domestic cash flow and our ongoing commitment to generating shareholder value.","Now to guidance; we expect our Q1 target revenues to range between $1.42 billion and $1.52 billion which at the midpoint implies a sequential decline of approximately 11% and a 3% decrease year-over-year. This sequential decline reflects our typical Q4 to Q1 seasonal revenue dynamics as well as conservatism around OEM business in light of our Q4 results and our future expectations given the business conditions impacting certain OEM customers.","With that said we expect to continue to drive strong operational performance and prudently manage expenses. In Q1 we expect to generate consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 63.5 to 64%, and non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 15%. Based on our stock repurchases in Q4 and in the first 10 days of Q1, we expect our diluted share counts for the quarter to decline to approximately 332 million shares and non-GAAP earnings per share for Q1 to range from approximately $0.53 to $0.58 per share.","Overall as we look at fiscal year 2015, NetApp remains well positioned to help customers navigate through their hybrid cloud strategies with market-leading scale out and converged solutions. We remain confident in our strategy and committed to enhancing shareholder value over the long-term.","For the year, we anticipate mid single-digit branded revenue growth ramping over the course of the year and partially offset by declines in OEM revenue of up to 40%. They're ultimately dependent on revenue mix and growth. We expect fiscal 2015 gross margin of approximately 63 to 64% and operating margin of approximately 18%.","As I mentioned last quarter, we are implementing a change in how we report our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be more reflective of our operational results and tax structure and to provide a better comparison with our peers.","For the year, we currently expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate under this new methodology to be approximately 16.5%. Finally, we intend to accelerate our current share repurchases program and to complete it over the course of the next 12 months, a year earlier than originally announced. Bottom line, our plans for fiscal 2015 translate to just under 10% growth in earnings per share and continued strong cash flow generation.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tom for more detail on the business momentum. Tom?","Tom Georgens","","Thanks, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our operational execution again this quarter. We delivered revenue within our guidance range, while expanding gross in operating profit margins to levels among the highest in the history of the company, all despite unanticipated headwinds in our OEM business.","In calendar 2013 we outgrew the market, gained share and increased gross margins, demonstrating our competitive advantage and the value we deliver. With the steep ramp of Clustered ONTAP, the acceleration of our broad flash portfolio and our differentiated approach to the cloud, we are participating in a greater range of customer engagements than in any time in our history.","As we've discussed before, customers have choice in new technology and IT delivery options that enable them to modernize and create compelling business outcomes that were not previously possible. A particular impact is the cloud, which offers a degree of flexibility; and for certain workloads, economic benefits that cannot be achieved with traditional on-premises computing.","For our final workloads where the economics are not advantageous or where regulatory security of performance concerns exist, owned infrastructure is a preferred choice. These factors will result in most enterprises having a combination of internal and external infrastructure primarily known as the hybrid cloud. Ideally customers would like the cloud to be a seamless extension of a internal environment truly integrating public and private clouds.","One of the biggest challenges to this vision is data management. While other parts of the infrastructure are largely fungible and carry no history, once data is created, it needs to be protected and managed for its lifetime. As data grows data and application mobility become increasingly bandwidth and time consuming. The net result is that data management, NetApp's core competency is absolutely essential in the realization of the promise of the hybrid cloud.","Data ONTAP, the number one storage operating system in the world already delivers the industry's richest data management portfolio and Clustered ONTAP is unmatched in meeting IT transformation requirements of both the enterprise and service providers. It is the only enterprise scale at the SAN platform. It is more reliable and easier to manage than other scale on NAS solutions and is able to consistently support multiple workloads with multi tenant management and performance scaling across disk, flash and hybrid storage.","On our Q4 call last year, we talked about the complex development transition to Clustered Data ONTAP being behind us. Over the course of fiscal year '14 we saw a increasing momentum as customers and partners learned about the value of Clustered ONTAP and began deploying it broadly. For the full year fiscal year '14 clustered notes grew 242% from fiscal year '13. The attach rate of Clustered ONTAP increased across all of our product lines with high end platforms approaching 50% in Q4. Most notably the attach rate of our new FAS8000 product line was over 60%.","To-date we have shipped over one Xobite of storage managed by Clustered ONTAP systems. With hybrid cloud as the dominant paradigm, on-premise's IT is not going away. However, due to budget constraints the customer's ability to evaluate, integrate and ultimately deploy solutions is being impacted. This trend is driving a demand that convert solutions that reduce the time of deployment and lower integration risk. By working with other best of breed hardware and software providers, we can offer a compelling business value with reduced risk in ways that cannot be matched by the proprietary staffs at the server vendors.","Our strategic partnership at Cisco around FlexPod Solutions delivers on this promise, and we said FlexPod unit shipments grow 71% from Q4 of last year. With over 18 petabytes of flash sold last quarter, NetApp is the leader in the flash market with the best position portfolio both in terms of what is available today and what is coming.","We are seeing multiple use cases emerging with different requirements balancing price, performance and features. One of the clearest examples is database acceleration. We are seeing rapid adoption in database environments using the EF all-flash array where data management is done by the application.","Given the high end nature of these workloads, exceptional performance and availability are necessary. The latter requirement frequently disqualifies the less mature new entrance to the market. We frequently see EF systems in front of frame arrays sometimes actually replacing them. We are very confident in the competitive position of the EF both now and in the future.","A second less clear set of use cases are those that have to be served by more fully featured flash arrays as customers balance the performance and power saving advantages with the higher cost of flash media. We are seeing some traction highly compressible, less mission critical workloads like BDI.","As mentioned in our last call, we are seeing increased deployment of all-flash FAS arrays with Clustered ONTAP. A customer can create an all-flash node within a cluster and use transparent volume migrations and move less active data to lower cost media as the data ages. Or a customer can distribute the flash throughout the cluster to effectively produce a scale out multi protocol hybrid or all-flash solution.","These are capabilities that no other vendor offers and we expect adoption to accelerate with the introduction of our newly refreshed high performance controller platforms. Units shipped of the EF family grew more than 3000% and all-flash FAS units increased 80% from Q4 a year ago. Beyond the strong growth of the EF family the branded E-Series products also grew nicely. E-Series units shipped exclusive of the EF products grew more than 170% from Q4 of last year. Our high end FAS shipments grew 8% year-on-year. Mid range FAS systems shipped were roughly flat, and interest expense we're down 18%.","In Q4 we introduced the FAS8000 product line, our first generation of clustered optimized systems. We are very pleased with the performance of the new products and have the fastest initial quarter ramp of any systems in our history. Soon you can expect us to refresh the remainder of the FAS product line.","In past calls I've discussed a difficult environment which we are operating in. Budgets are compressed; customers are expending the life of their assets and delaying purchases while evaluating new technologies. In a constrained environment we must hone our competitive edge and capture more than our fair share of the opportunities.","With the re-architected Clustered ONTAP the introduction of the EF, the ramp of the E-Series and the promise of flash array, we are participating in opportunities that would not have previously been available to us. We also need to be sure we are investing in the technologies that will be industry leading as the market transitions and new architectures emerge. Our recent realignment was specifically intended to direct our resources towards our biggest opportunities.","Our investments in the integration of cloud services and open source solutions into our software-defined data management framework uniquely position us to enable our customers to operationalize the cloud and other new emerging technologies.","We expect our branded revenue growth to once again outpace that of the total industry in fiscal year '15 with solid gross margins and strong cash flow. Before opening the call for Q&A I'd like to thank the entire NetApp team for their hard work and dedication. We are focused on innovation and execution, which enables us to meet the evolving needs of our customers and we've strong operational returns. In a challenging environment we are generating operating leverage in our business model supporting continued investment and innovation and yielding strong cash flow.","At this point, we will open up the call for Q&A. As always I ask that you be respectful of your peers on the call and limit yourself to one question, so we can address as many people as possible. Thank you. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Alex Kurtz from Sterne Agee.","Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee","Yeah. Sorry about that guys; I was on mute. Tom, can you just talk about how you see the next fiscal year playing off us around channels in our pipeline whether it's refreshes of new products, new verticals that you are attacking? I think people are looking at the branded product guide for the year and trying to understand how do you get to that number and sort of where you are sort of seeing that play off from a seasonality perspective and new products we expect to have come to the market next phase six to 12 months?","Tom Georgens","Yeah, I think as you look at the market overall, clearly that's a challenging environment as you talked about. We see people extending the life of their assets, and if you take assets from a three or four year life to a four or five year life, that's a pretty big hold on growth rate of market, and I think we are clearly seeing that. There is a couple of things that I think that are specific to us as well. We have a very, very strong federal business. We are number one in market share there. And clearly with the shutdown at the end of the fiscal year, we didn't have that at the beginning of last year. So I think we got top of Q1 and Q2 compared on the federal side of the business that ultimately will age off.","So I think overall we will take a tailwind if we get it, but I don't think anybody is predicting that at this point in time. We are going to try and competing within the market that we are at. But if I look at the business overall, certainly the OEM were disappointing in this quarter and looking forward with the uncertainty and lack of visibility we have deep into those businesses, I think we are just trying to take that down, so we don't have any more surprises and focus on the branded business.","The branded business was up 4% year-over-year last year. And if I look at our portfolio whether it would be the ramp of Clustered ONTAP it would still relatively early days a year ago. If I look at how far we come with EF from effectively a standing start to a compelling position in the market, I think the field is embracing E-Series in a meaningful way that they weren't doing a year ago. And flash only on the way and the other thing is you will hear more about our software-defined and cloud story at Analyst Day, but sharing that with customers I think people view that very, very positively and see that as a reduction of risk by NetApp (indiscernible).","So I think that we've got a set of things even independent in the macro around us that we did not have in our toolkit a year ago. And while we have some tough comparison on the federal side and I don't think anybody is expecting a miraculous turnaround in overall spending, I just think our competitiveness is that much better. And I think that we can leverage those into growth. And like I said in the aggregate we did 4% branded growth this year. So I believe while we are on the side that's really going to be challenging. We want to take that down, so we can stop talking about it for the time being. And the real focus is those OEM businesses that are still growing and likewise primarily around the branded. And that's why we broke out the OEM comparison all along because we knew we would be on this downward trend and we will focus on the go-forward businesses.","Nick Noviello","And Alex, this is Nick, just a follow up on you asked a little bit on seasonality on that branded side of business. We expect that seasonality even for the Q1 to be pretty consistent with what we've talked about in the past, and as I indicated this ramps over the course of the year. We will go through -- Tom talked about federal in Q2, go through year end in Q3 and a ramp up in Q4, but pretty normal in terms of certainly with the Q4 to (indiscernible) branded side and then ramping through the year.","Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Wittine from Longbow Research.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Hi, thanks. The question is on the service provider business, EMC recently came out and framed up the size of the infrastructure, they are selling to cloud SPEs. I think it would be effective kind of lifting the curtain and easing investor concerns on the overall cloud risks. I know you referenced the third-party data in the past, saying you are number one, but are you willing to kind of frame up the relative size of that business for you and really the world of opportunity going forward as well?","Tom Georgens","Well, I think that there is plenty of cloud business definitions out there. We had a vertical market around the service provider community which includes the TELCOs and the traditional service providers. And in fact that's been the fastest growing segment for us. On prior calls we talked about 200 service provider customers and a number of applications that we run there. And so the service provider, you are seeing the data NetApp number one in storage for the public cloud. But are we used to go actually beyond that into the hyperscalers and it doesn't certainly mean that we are going to sell the hyperscaler systems, but the hyperscalers are offering capability that's attracting to our customer set. And what you usually expect to see from NetApp as we rollout, we talked about our strategy is how do we enable customers to realize the benefits of that? How do we enable them to create a seamless extension of their on-premise computing?","So, for us the data management component and the software component that is key and I think in some ways that's effectively the ultimate in unified stores just the ability to create an opportunity to seamlessly extend our data management whether it's on our systems or other people's systems whether it's not a private storage in conjunction with Amazon or whether it's actually in the cloud.","So from our point of view is that all of those are components as the traditional sell-through of the service providers that are providing enterprise services and therefore big consumers of commercial equipment. And I think our position there speaks for itself and like I said even last year in a tough market that was our fastest growing segment. And then beyond that we are also looking to embrace the hyperscalers into our data management framework. So all of those components of the cloud both the traditional service providers and the hyperscalers are integral to our overall strategy.","Operator","The next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Pacific Crest Securities.","Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest","Tom, I wanted to follow up on the strategy side specifically. What's your appetite -- risk appetite to diversify the portfolio, accelerate growth through M&A? And the reason why I ask you generated over a billion dollars in cash flow over the last four years. And each of the last four years you have over $4 billion in cash net of debt, but if I look at that OEM partnering strategy that business has been cut in half, now to $440 million kind of run rate. Your branded business has grown 3% or 4% over the last couple of years, but again has benefited from a tailwind around a new product cycle. So a question here, what's the strategy, the plan that kind of stays the course with what you are doing or are you thinking about different ways to accelerate growth diversify the portfolio through M&A given the strong cash flows, given the cash that you have on your balance sheet.","Tom Georgens","Yeah. I think first on the OEM side, I think one thing to bear in mind on the OEM is probably two facts. One is while we talk about the OEM business and the OEM business declined there is multiple components to that. Part of that is E-Series, but there is also N-Series which is the old ONTAP based products for the IBM relationship which is on a similar trajectory, so the OEM business discussions and specifically in E-Series discussion. On the other hand the branded side of E-Series brought with us the capability to be in the position that we are in with all-flash arrays. In the aggregate you see our flash number, so we are very, very happy with that and likewise the momentum of the E-Series.","And the thing I point out on the EF and the E-Series is the nature of the business that we are competing for and winning there. We in the majority -- the overall majority case we would not have been competing for how we not have those products in our portfolio. So we are very excited about the E-Series component of the portfolio from a technology perspective as we ever have, and clearly the OEM business, we are on a trajectory that it's on. And clearly we are breaking up that separately anticipating the trajectory that it would be moving albeit to stay a step down was a bit of a surprise.","To be more complete on the M&A side, clearly I think we are open to opportunities that are going to drive the growth of the company. I think that we are looking for deals that are executable that are obviously affordable that's shipped within our core competency that we can bring value to that by virtue of having it in our portfolio we can add value to the business and ultimately they are going to drive growth. So I think in a transitioning market whether there is a lot of new technologies and a lot of new alternatives for customers, there is a lot of properties out there to look at. So to answer your question I am not going to signal any intention of any timeframe or any targets. I am surprised to say we understand the dynamics, we understand what customers are thinking and for the right transactions we'd be very much inclined to do M&A.","Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Yes, thanks. DSOs would suggest that it was a backend loaded quarter and others have talked about a stronger April relative to the calendar first quarter. Just curious whether you saw that April strength and if that could possibly deliver some surprise in the July quarter relative to your seasonal guidance.","Nick Noviello","Katy, sure, DSOs at 47 days were a little higher than they were in Q4 of last year. It does talk to certain elements of the business happening towards the end of April, it's all current. So we have no concerns on those and no concerns on collectability. In terms of the guidance again that guidance is based on bottom up, so we do across the business, across the geographies, across the OEMs and bottom up for Q1. So I would point out that what we talked about before that sequential view of Q4 to Q1 is pretty consistent with what we have done in the past. We've remained conservative on the OEM side on top of it, which we think is appropriate given how Q4 went and given the position of some of the OEM partners. And I think the guidance stands and I don't think there is anything to suggest that it should be higher than what we've put out there to you at this point. And the DSOs again are just an element of the business and there is strong execution happening already in Q1 with respect to bringing in all of that cash.","Tom Georgens","Another point I'd add is that this tends to be a highest DSO quarter of the year, so we are up substantially from the prior quarter. It's up from the prior year, but not as much as the few days, so four or five days. Yeah, there tend to be the cyclicality of the business. But I wouldn't try and read anything into the DSO and second guess our guidance.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian White from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Yeah, just a couple of things, number one could you talk a little bit about the relationship with Cisco and ACI was obviously and also inner cloud that was a big deal at Cisco Live this week. I know you are part of it, their announcements around it. So maybe how do you think that will play out?","And just Nick, around operating margins, it seems like there is a much steeper drop in this Q1 on operating margins and we saw last year we had a similar revenue follow up, so maybe you can address that. Thank you.","Tom Georgens","Yeah. I think general on many fronts. We continue to collaborate with Cisco. So certainly the ACI, the inner cloud obviously continued with FlexPods and other things around some other initiatives, OpenStack. So we continue to actually need to be, and continues to be a very multi-faceted relationship. So, in our relation with them I think it's all systems at go. I think we are finding more and more ways to engage. As far as inner cloud and ACI, clearly those are top initiatives for them. So I think being connected to them, being part of messaging, being part of private offering and part of their customer discussion is really important to us.","So I think -- although I think Cisco is pushing pretty hard and I think that collaboration with NetApp is working really well. I think we continue to have momentum where we talked about FlexPod shipments being up 71% year-over-year. So I think -- so very, very much alive and well. And in fact now with ACI and inner cloud I think we just had an appearance with them this week at the Cisco Live Event.","Nick Noviello","Yeah, I think the other point I would make on the in terms of the sequential here, I talked about the sequential revenue declines and when I go back a couple of years and there were sequential revenue declines from Q4 to Q1 of intimate teams. Last year it was 12% which is Q4 '13 to Q1 '14. Those will carry with them, a decline in operating margin of the company, all of them were. We also have gotten some benefits in the fourth quarter from our repositioning activity that we did and quarterly talked about that in terms of the earnings. We will start reinvesting those that's a reallocation activity. So that's all baked into the change the difference in operating margins from Q4 of '14 to Q1 of '15. So I don't think there is anything outside of that. We are balancing investment, we are balancing returns from the business and we are balancing sequential revenue decline that we typically expect from Q4 to Q1.","Tom Georgens","Yeah, in fact we are -- if we go through the guidance we are actually guiding above where we were a year ago and that promising the same trajectory to see we are at almost 21 points at this point by now. So clearly there is seasonality. We think gross margin of the business obviously the revenue fall through the bottom line is actually quite large, so as the revenue is volatile so is the bottom line. So yeah, it's a transition from Q4 to Q1, I get that, but if you do the year-over-year compare I think it leads us in a position to deliver on next full year commitment.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Kaushik Roy from Wunderlich.","Kaushik Roy - Wunderlich","Hi, Tom. So can you help us understand why the traditional storage system vendors IBM, EMC and others start to see negative revenue growth whereas the new hybrid vendors such as (indiscernible) growing so rapidly? Is it because they have a new architecture that's superior? Alternatively does NetApp need to build something from the ground up?","Tom Georgens","Well, I think that obviously you have got much, much different scale. You've got install base. There is a whole bunch of dynamics that separate the smaller players from the bigger players. And when I look at this I mean those cover a fair amount of ground in terms of use cases. I think there are some of those technologies there that are outside of our current space if we were to participate organically we would have to start from scratch, but in the storage systems market, if anything I'd use flash as an example. We certainly heard a lot of this start from scratch new technology, everything we knew about the past is no longer relevant and here we are with EF in a very, very strong position, in a very, very well defined segment of flash.","And then likewise I think the ability to deploy flash not necessarily as a standalone point product, but as a nod in a cluster with all of the data management and the volume migration and all of that that goes with it, it's a pretty compelling offering. So we've heard this, do I need to start from scratch and certainly if it's not in a business that we are currently in the answer to that is yes. And the businesses that we are in if I actually look at where the momentum lies in this business and who is actually driving the leadership position here, it's actually NetApp. And flash is probably the classic example here. I'll just state it flat out. I would not trade the flash portfolio of NetApp with the flash portfolio of any other company we have to start it from scratch or otherwise.","Kaushik Roy - Wunderlich","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Srini Nandury from Summit Research.","Srini Nandury - Summit Research","As you look at last quarter you gave us information about the number of customers you are adding, can you provide this statistic if you can this quarter? And as you look at average deal size over the years, how has that changed most recently?","Tom Georgens","I don't remember a new customer component. We may have talked about in specifically in terms of maybe in EF or E-Series, but suffice to say those numbers were up huge, in fact the E-Series bookings roughly doubled in two quarters with the EF included. So that continues at a big number. So I don't remember that number off the top of my head, but its fine to say it's robust.","In terms of aggregate deal size, in terms of overall transactions, if you look at our mix we are seeing 3000 and 6000 so I should say the mid range and high end platforms doing a bit better than the lower end platforms. So in the aggregate the ASP just on that basis will be going up, but that's individual box ASP. I think more broadly if there is probably one trend that we saw over the course of certainly of Q4 is we actually saw more bigger deals available to us. And if I said there was one thing that we saw in that quarter that was different than perhaps some other quarters is just very, very significant deals. And they come in various varieties. Some of them are Tech refresh and some of them in new projects.","And the other thing is enterprise service and enterprise license agreements. Very, very large transactions are not to mention while I don't have this in a new term in terms of revenue realization you will see it on the differed balances up $100 million from last year. So if I just go to deals overall, I would say more bigger deals available to us, maybe that's a positive development, but too early to tell. But the other thing that we saw a lot of last quarter more so than any other quarters enterprise license agreements, enterprise service agreements. And the value to that of course is while it does have the near term revenue because of the ratability of it. It's a commitment to NetApp over the long term, obviously it's key and in some ways because the software is pretty sold. That's also a commitment to on-premises' computing.","Srini Nandury - Summit Research","Thank you, Tom.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Hi, Tom, I would like to ask on a strategy question as well, particularly related to the OEM business. The OEM business was down 34% this quarter. You are guiding it to decline by another 40%. The margins are lower than the branded business. Why be in the business? It sounds like you are letting customers continue to take their business back. Why not be more proactive in taking the business to its natural state rather than watching it decline?","Tom Georgens","Well, I think that being in the business means a few things. I want to be clear on a couple of points. We could cease to serve products to our OEMs. I guess that's a way to exit the business. If the idea is why don't we just get rid of that business on the technology is that the technology underneath that business is the E-Series technology and the EF that goes with it, which is very strategic for us and there is a lot of momentum? And likewise the N-Series which is also on the same downward trajectory with IBM have ONTAP underneath it. So at the end of the day the technology investments behind these technologies that are driving our branded business are alive as well and we are excited about those as ever. However, they are taking through those through the OEM channels clearly is what we are talking about here.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Yes.","Tom Georgens","There are two things. One of which is the investment in terms of the restructuring that we just did. Clearly the OEM go to market activity around those vendors that are more committed to us long term that's clearly an area that we have taken down. And we get that next size in proportion to where we think this business needs to be. The other question of why we just stop selling to them, I think what that does is just takes the number down fast and that doesn't change the ultimate outcome.","In the meantime there is no doubt that some of those products that are being sold to customers and we were going to get to on our own. Now the broader question for partners that have made choices other than NetApp we are not sitting idle by. We are competing to preserve that business and bring it into the NetApp domain. So the idea that this is a passive where you will sit and watch, I wouldn't say that. We've clearly scaled the business appropriately. We are clearly investing in the technology although targeted primarily for our branded customers. At the same time where the relationship is not good or where they are making choices about other products in that portfolio, we are aggressively pursuing that and competing with our branded product in our existing channels.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","So the inference time just that this business ends up being a 50 million to 60 million run rate business or does it ultimately go to a position where it's at zero. And I understand the technology is important, that not what I am suggesting, but just the OEM slice in particular.","Tom Georgens","Yeah. I don't think it will ever go to zero, because their elements, their relationships in the OEM business that are actually quite positive that are entirely incremental to us and with the right investment very profitable for us as well. So we are not going to get rid of those. But it should be quirky, the reason why we broke this business out in the first place two years ago or three years ago from the very beginning was the understanding that was going to be on a trajectory different than the branded. The rationale of the transaction was not about the branded business. That was nice. That was really about the technology and the opportunity -- I'm sorry, it's not about the OEM business, it's not the technology and the opportunity we can connect on -- we could go after on the branded side.","So if we thought that this business have the same economics and the same run rate we've never broken it out if they are two different categories. It was an understanding that we will be moving in this direction is why we want to be able to carve this off and just view whatever we get out of that as incremental and focus on the momentum on the branded side which on the E-Series has actually been quite strong. So at the end of the day, I think this latest step down was a surprise. We will upfront about that, that's not what we forecasted.","On the other hand, the overall trajectory of down from the first day when we acquired it, that is not a surprise, and that's why we broke the businesses out and report the way we do.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Lou Miscioscia from CLSA.","Lou Miscioscia - CLSA","Thank you. Tom, can you dig in a little bit deeper to the service provider? It sounded it you are breaking them into two different categories, the hyperscale companies, it sounds like you are considering selling your software only to them, and if you are, could you possibly size the opportunity for that market?","And then secondarily, we've talked to a lot of service providers in hyperscale, web hosters and not all of them actually designed their own software, so making it difficult for you to sell any product to them. Where does that break exist? Could you shed some light on that? Is it just three or four that do it all themselves, five, 10, 15, where do you think it might exist? Thank you.","Tom Georgens","Okay. So clearly a few questions in there; I think -- so let's actually start from the hyperscalers and work back. And so the likelihood of our selling or companies like us selling full systems to the hyperscalers to deploy in their environment is pretty low, because they've engineered their environment and written their own tools and in a lot of case they've written their own apps.","So in that particular case, would we consider unbundling our software and selling elements of our intellectual property to them? Absolutely, we would, because the data management problems that they face don't go away. There are still challenging problems. I don't want to signal that that's what we're doing whether there is an incremental revenue stream associated with that, I'd just say that that's something that we will be opened to under the right circumstances. But the difference between the hyperscalers and some of the other service providers, even the large ones is in order to do these roll your own, develop your own solutions and infrastructure takes an enormous amount of R&D.","And the ability of all of the players in that particular space to deliver that level of R&D investment is limited. So not everybody can emulate what the Microsoft and Amazon are doing. And in so doing they will pick other particular dimensions. They will go after integrating traditional commercial products and that's why I was talking about the service providers earlier and as people are trying to provide enterprise services at a very, very high level for very, very sophisticated customers, integrate with our on-premise environment. And that's what we are trying drive with the service providers. And that's a big market opportunity for our standard product. And we are going after that as aggressively as we can, and I think a number to support the success, and certainly it's been a growth market for us.","However, they ultimately will need to compete with Amazon. And it isn't clear or certainly not clear that they've got the R&D to basically engineer all of these things themselves, which is driving a level of collaboration with them, and that drives the desire for such things. Its OpenStack technologies or open source technologies like OpenStack.","So, from our point of view in helping our service providers create services that can compete with those guys we are also collaborating with a lot of the open source community to help them create solutions that they can customize for their environment that leverage the open source community. So it's a whole hierarchy of things. So I think if we are going to sell for the hyperscalers, primarily being intellectual property type of transaction and if we sell to service providers, in some cases depending on the scope and scale and complexity of the services they are offering by standard products, and in addition we will also try and do some element of customized do-it-yourself open source and that's what's really driving our investment in OpenStack.","But the other thing about the hyperscalers is we are viewing this as the hyperscale only as the customer, and I think what you will hear more from us on Analyst Day, too much to go into here is the hyperscalers offer a set of capabilities that are very attractive to the customer and being able to operationilize that and deliver those values to the enterprise customer is still a very difficult problem. And the question is how do you create a seamless extension of on-premise computing into the cloud that can leverage the hyperscalers?","And the key component of doing that is data management. And we will talk about our software-defined strategy and how ONTAP enables us to solve all of that. So the kind of longwinded answer here is that all of the service providers are both also partners. Sometimes we will sell them full systems, sometimes we will collaborate with them around their open source, sometimes we will sell intellectual property, but at the end of the day the end goal is how do we create a set of services that could be consumed by the enterprise and then afterward the seamless expansion of on-premise computing and the data management that goes with it is very, very, very important to realizing the hybrid cloud vision.","Lou Miscioscia - CLSA","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rajesh Ghai from Macquarie.","Rajesh Ghai - Macquarie","Yes, thanks. A lot of commentary on the goal regarding the momentum of the E-Series and EF-Series; I was hoping you could quantify the size of the branded E-Series business. And related to that, I wanted to understand the factors behind the decline of OEM business, how much of that has been caused by OEMs moving to other solutions or their own solutions and how much is related to the macro, secular challenges you are facing in the server businesses? Thank you.","Tom Georgens","Well, I think the nature of the OEM business is first and foremost their ability to compete, and then the other factor is what is the product mix within that account? And I think that they all vary. IBM is probably the most visible and the most common one. They report the storage business separately down significantly in the last few quarters over 20%. Likewise, IBM also has a portfolio of products that they can sell that are alternatives to NetApp. So I think at IBM we have both of those dynamics in play, and that is their ability to sell-through has been challenged and likewise our positioning within their portfolio has been challenged.","Now, the other OEMs vary OEM-by-OEM. And one of the things about the OEM business is you need to be careful about what we disclose about them. But I'd say that amongst our other OEMs I think we are firmly positioned in terms of the products that we offer, so the dynamic of mix shift within the OEM I don't think is in play. And I think most of the OEM dynamic is related to their own sell-through.","Nick Noviello","So, maybe why don't I make a point there, Rajesh. We actually don't go into the specific details on the sizing of each piece of business. What I would say to you and Tom mentioned before around why we did this transaction three years ago and the value of the E-Series to that transaction. So when we go look at how are we doing on the transaction side of the fence and we look at the ramp up and the run rate we are now driving for on the E-Series branded side, we are actually well within, if not, trending above our original expectations of that business. So we are very satisfied with how the E-Series branded business is going and how that technology is working in this portfolio.","Tom Georgens","Probably the other thing I would add on E-Series is that if you look at where EF is moving aggressively which is effectively SAN database acceleration. That's probably not a market that's been a dominant notion for us in the past. And it's probably safe to say that overwhelming majority of the opportunities we're pursuing there are opportunities that would not have been available to NetApp, had we not have that product in our portfolio. And I think likewise, if we look more broadly at the E-Series and where that's been deployed, the type of use cases around pricing performance and capacity optimization, those two are workloads that probably would not have been pursued by our sales force, but we not had those elements in the portfolio.","So if I look at E-Series I think that there is no doubt that E-Series is not substantially overlapping what we currently have that E-Series is truly bringing incremental opportunities to NetApp both within our existing accounts and as a tool to open new accounts.","Rajesh Ghai - Macquarie","Excellent, and thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Hi, thank you. I wanted to get your thoughts on overall enterprise spending as we move into the back half of the year, obviously enterprises have been confused about what they want to invest in terms of their infrastructure, and we are seeing a positive spending. Your guidance suggests there are some acceleration in growth in the back half of the year. I think IDC has updated their expectations expecting an acceleration on the back half, I just wanted to get your thoughts about linearity for the year. Thanks.","Tom Georgens","Well, I think one of the things that's a factor that will be unique in NetApp is really federal. We saw a federal slowdown with the shutdown and the budget activities. And that hit us hard in Q3 and Q4. So we will have tougher compares on the federal side for sure in Q1 and Q2. So that's clearly a factor that's specific to us. I also think that we have got our own dynamics as our own product refresh, but the product's family of the hardware platforms are probably never been newer than they are today. So as we get the laps of those announcements into the market I think we could see some uptick there.","I think a broader sense of overall IT spending, certainly we see equipment aging. We clearly see that. We see some bigger deals that I talked about earlier last quarter, but I think at this point it will be probably a little bit too early to both predict and return and also factor that into our guidance. Our guidance is pretty much based on the NetApp's specific factors and no fundamental material change in the market overall. If we get a tailwind we will take it, but right now we are assuming no change in the market as we think about our go-forward plans.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Craig from Bank of America.","Scott Craig - Bank of America","Hi, thanks, good afternoon. And Nick, I was wondering if you could just discuss the gross margin outlook for fiscal 2015, there is obviously going to be a number of moving parts and that could be mix or whatever. So I was just wondering if you could give us your sort of assumptions as you look at the product and services and then some of the underlying assumptions even within those banks.","Nick Noviello","Sure. I think when you look at the year and you look to the overall guidance of 63% to 64% there is always going to be puts and takes quarter-to-quarter. Over the past year on the product gross margin side we had a pretty substantial ramp up here over the course of the year. We've talked about the productivity we've driven in the system. Right? We have also talked about continued price competitiveness in spite of driving that additional productivity in the system. And in addition there is going to OEM mix. And that certainly was part of Q4. And I talked about warranty and those types of things as well.","So those are all factors that we will work through in FY'15. So on the product side of the fence I'm not specifically pointing out your guidance range for product or service or SEM should be X. I'll potentially talk more about that at the end of June at our Analyst Day, but these types of rates certainly I would expect that product gross margin will be down a bit in Q1. So I wouldn't want anybody to take away that 58%, which is the exit from Q4 is the floor for next year and this will be what it is. It's going to be little bit more dynamic than that. But continuing to work the productivity side, looking at the mix, all of those pieces will play a part.","On the services side of the fence we ended the year pretty substantially up. The services side is little fundamentally different from the product side. And why is that, because on the services side of the business we invest in front of the revenue that is to come, because in many respects big chunk of this business is us servicing contracts that we have entered into for periods of time. So we will from time-to-time make significant investments in that infrastructure and then take advantage of those investments as we go.","So certainly when we look from a Q4 to a Q1, I'm expecting that services gross margin to come down. I expect the services gross margin to move around a bit over the course of the year, but again be within those types of guide posts of the overall margin guidance I gave at 63% to 64%. Last point on that service is 62.6%, which is a Q4 exit is a high watermark, and I'm looking at four years of history here. So I don't think you should take away -- that's the type of rate we would expect on services gross margin certainly in Q1 and likely for good part of the year and 2015.","Tom Georgens","Yeah, I'd like to actually add a little bit different -- an additional commentary on the gross margin side. The gross margin side in terms of where we've been, it's actually up three points year-over-year in each of the last two quarters. And I think that's a function of several things. Nick went through a number of the elements, but on the product side, clearly we spend a lot of time this year working through the COGS side of the equation driving efficiencies in the business, and I'm really pleased with the work of the team on that front. But at the end of the day, the competitiveness in gross margin goes through the competitiveness of the product. And I think there is a lot to be said in that number in terms of the competitiveness of products than we were a year ago.","So one of the questions that we get a lot in forums like this or in callbacks later is are you basically letting growth go in favor of gross margins? It's just simply not the case. I mean one of the things that I want to be really clear about is that in this environment there are not a lot of big deals running around and we have a lot of capacity chasing too few deals and nobody can afford to walk from deals. So we are competitive, we are aggressive, particularly in trying to break into new accounts. And NetApp is not walking away from business based on price.","On the other hand, within a reasonable set of bounds at the other day price is not the primary driver, ultimately functionality, not with that limit, but within bounds functionality ultimately determines who wins and who loses here. I think what NetApp has proven over the course of this year is that with the training of our partners, the training of our people and the understanding of our customers of the value proposition that we can win on function that we don't have to the price leader to be successful here. I think that's what you are seeing, three points of gross margin increase for NetApp and you are also seeing declines in gross margin of our competitors. I don't think that's a coincidence that's directly tied to the competitiveness of products in the face of the customer.","Scott Craig - Bank of America","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from Maynard Um from Wells Fargo.","Maynard Um - Wells Fargo","Hi, thank you. Free cash flow as a percentage of net income over the past four years in the fourth quarter has been really in the mid-high 20% to 30%. In this quarter it's at 19%. I think some are obvious, but can you just talk about the puts and takes and then how we should think about free cash flow in Q1 and fiscal '15? Can this drive back up to sort of the 19% to 21% type levels? Thanks.","Nick Noviello","Yeah. Maynard, I'll go into cash flow certainly at our Analyst Day. When we look at cash flow we certainly think about the high-teens types of numbers, and that's what we model out. And we are thinking through what we need in the business and what runs through on the net income side, but we are going to have to think about DSOs. Obviously we've talked about that earlier on this call; CapEx and a number of other factors.","So when you think about free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, those types of high-teens is where we aim for that. Certainly it doesn't happen quarter-to-quarter. And Q1s are usually lower in terms of cash flow performance as a percentage of revenue. And then we look at capital allocation and I'll just reiterate we're going to expect again a year where we generate over a billion. We had very strong performance each year of the last several, and this is a cash flow generating company and at a high-teens as a percentage of revenue I think is very, very healthy. And then we go and talk about capital allocation. I think what we've done there over the past year and what we plan to do for this coming year is also very strong.","Maynard Um - Wells Fargo","Great, thank you.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Georgens for final comments.","Tom Georgens","Thank you, and thank you all of you for your interest in NetApp. I think as we finished Q4 and we finish the fiscal year, if I had a high level theme it's that NetApp was very, very strong on the execution front on the operational perspective driving very, very high gross margin, very, very high operating margins. So, on a tough environment I think the ability of the company to execute, drive value to our customers and ultimately deliver compelling returns to our shareholders with EPS up 22%, I think that came through.","In calendar year 2013, where we had market share gains above the average of our last 10 years, and we continue to look forward to the upcoming year where we have things we did not have a year ago, we've got Clustered ONTAP, and that was true momentum. We've got the E-Series. We've got the momentum of our flash. We've got new platforms. We've got flash array on the way. And we also look forward at Analyst Day recognizing that this is also an industry in transition, but now we can compete for on-premise computing and the elements today. We are also talking about where we are going as a company, our vision for software defined, our vision for the cloud, and NetApp continues to be relevant and continues to be successful.","So thanks all of you for your time today, and I look forward to seeing all of you at Analyst Day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

We describe these factors in our accompanying press release, which we have filed on an 8-K with the SEC, as well as in our 10-K and 10-Q reports also on file with the SEC and available on our website, all of which are incorporated by reference in today's discussion.","All numbers discussed today are GAAP, unless otherwise stated. To see the reconciling items between the non-GAAP and GAAP, you may refer to the table in our press release, our supplemental commentary or on our website.","In a moment, Nick will walk you through some additional color on our financial results, and then Tom will walk you through his perspective on the business for this quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas R. Noviello","Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. NetApp delivered financial results in line with our expectations for fiscal Q2. Revenue of $1.54 billion was roughly at the midpoint of our guidance range. We achieved gross margins of 60.6% and exceeded our prior guidance with operating margins of 14.4%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 exceeded the high end of our guidance range, and we generated $269 million in free cash flow in the quarter, about 17% of revenue.","Revenue increased 7% sequentially and 2% from Q2 last year. Year-over-year growth was negatively impacted by 1.5 points from FX. Branded revenue was up 8% sequentially and 4% year-over-year despite the continued challenges in the macroeconomic environment.","OEM revenue was flat versus Q1 and down 9% versus Q2 last year, the result of a reduction in demand from OEM customers. Product revenue was up 11% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Both software entitlements and maintenance and service revenue were within expected ranges.","All geographies showed flat to modest year-over-year revenue growth with the exception of Asia Pacific, which was up 14%. On a constant-currency basis, EMEA revenue was up 7% year-over-year.","Versus Q1, we also saw flat to modest revenue growth across the geographies. In the Americas, we saw a 12% sequential increase, comprised largely of expected growth in the U.S. public sector and corresponding to the fiscal year end of the U.S. government.","Non-GAAP gross margins of 60.6% were slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range and benefited from the strength of our product gross margins. At their highest rate since Q2 last year, non-GAAP product gross margins of 53.6% were driven primarily by increased sales of more highly configured systems. Software entitlements and maintenance and service margins were within normal ranges.","Non-GAAP operating margins of 14.4% exceeded our guidance range and increased almost 2 points over the previous quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 3% sequentially and 9% year-over-year as a result of our typical annual employee merit increases, moderately higher headcount and targeted investments across the business. We expect to continue to be judicious in spending going forward, given the current business climate.","Our Q2 effective tax rate remained constant at 17.3% based on our geographic distribution of revenue and profits. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 exceeded our prior guidance range by $0.01.","Our balance sheet remains robust with approximately $5.57 billion in cash and investments growing over $900 million since Q2 last year. Deferred revenue of $2.77 billion grew 14% year-over-year. Accounts receivable day sales outstanding of 36 days was slightly better than Q1 as well as Q2 last year. And rather than rebounding as expected, inventory turns remained low as we opted to keep inventory at higher-than-normal levels, consistent with the limited visibility we have into orders in this challenging environment. We expect inventory levels to return to a more normalized level next quarter.","Cash from operations was $336 million, and free cash flow was $269 million, about equal to Q2 last year. Our overall cash reflects approximately $200 million of stock we repurchased during Q2.","Diluted share count decreased in Q2 by approximately 3 million shares. The accounting for the shares associated with our convertible notes had a minimal impact of approximately 1 million shares, and the warrants had no impact this quarter. As you may recall, 80% of the convertible notes are hedged. You can find a table on our website which shows the impact on diluted share count for a range of stock prices.","Regarding capital allocation, I'm pleased to announce that we are continuing our share repurchase program with an additional $1.5 billion authorized. The return of capital to shareholders through our repurchase program is an important part of our ongoing capital allocation plan. We repurchased approximately 6 million shares of stock during the quarter and ended the quarter with approximately 148 million remaining of our prior repurchase authorization. Since inception, we have returned just under $4 billion to shareholders through our repurchase programs.","Separately, our convertible notes become fully convertible in March and are due in June 2013. We are actively evaluating our options for retiring this debt. These options range from paying off our notes by drawing from available cash to issuing new debt, which may be in the form of convertible notes or conventional debt.","Turning to guidance. Our target revenue range for Q3 is $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion which, at the midpoint, implies 5% sequential growth and 4% year-over-year growth. We expect consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 60% to 61% and non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 15%.  We expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 17.3%, bringing our non-GAAP EPS estimate to approximately $0.53 to $0.58 per share.","Diluted share count is projected to decrease to about 365 million shares in Q3 based on our average stock price of $27.66 for the first 8 days of the quarter. This does not include any shares from the convertible notes, since the average stock price is below the $31.85 strike price.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tom for his thoughts. Tom?","Thomas Georgens","Thanks, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. In what is unquestionably a challenging environment, NetApp produced a solid quarter. As Nick described, we are roughly at the midpoint of our revenue guidance, and our EPS was above the range. We saw meaningful sequential increases in revenue, gross margin, product margin, operating income, operating margin and cash flow. Our branded business was very strong this quarter, driven by the power of the value proposition and the momentum of cluster Data ONTAP. We have been making selective investments to drive growth, the results of which we have started to see this quarter.","We continue to make strides expanding into large accounts, growing our Storage 5000 presence in both new customer acquisition and driving larger NetApp footprints within existing accounts. We saw an almost 20% increase in deal sizes over $1 million from Q2 of last year. Data ONTAP enables NetApp to provide unique innovative capabilities to the largest data storage installations in the world. And we now have more than 150 customers over 10 petabytes, and our largest customer exceeds 1 exabyte.","We continue to see momentum in Data ONTAP 8.1, deployment of which almost doubled in Q2. Of particular importance is the acceleration in units of clustered ONTAP, which has more than doubled sequentially, and we now have both well over 1,000 clustered nodes. Clustered ONTAP combines the richest data management functionality of ONTAP, the industry's #1 storage operating system, with clustering to enable nearly unlimited scale, performance and non-disruptive operations. Clustered ONTAP has clear advantages and traditionally strong NetApp segments like virtualized private cloud environments and large-scale NAS, as well as being disruptive to legacy solutions and workloads where NetApp had previously not been considered.","Clustered ONTAP is the only architecture that can unify both structured and unstructured data at scale, as well as move data transparently in the cluster, eliminating the need for complex data migrations associated with data growth and hardware refreshes.","Our Flash solutions continue to demonstrate strong customer traction. Our offerings enable IT administrators to deploy controller-level, disc-level and server-level Flash with the same enterprise data management tools used to operate the rest of their NetApp storage infrastructure. Our controller-based option, Flash Cache, continues to be a strong seller. In Q1, we introduced Flash Pool the ability to optimize price\/performance through the innovative deployment of solid-state disk and the hard disk drives. The demonstrable customer benefit and ease of deployment are generating tremendous customer interest and hundreds of deployments.","In the second quarter, we announced Flash Accel to enable customers to utilize server-based Flash to accelerate application performance. We also announced an expanded alliance partner program to include server-caching partners and a resell agreement with Fusion-io. To date NetApp has sold 22 petabytes of Flash as a cache, accelerating over 2 exabytes of hard disk.","Turning to platforms. The recently refreshed FAS2000 family remains a strong performer, with units shipped growing 54% year-over-year. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we always see a migration towards newly announced products when they overlap older product families. We continue to see this in Q2 as some of the low end of the 3000 family moved to the 2000. The upper end of the 3000 was flat with last year, and last week, we announced the refresh of that FAS3000 product line with the introduction of that FAS3220 and FAS3250. Compared to previous systems, the new systems improve performance by up to 80%, increase storage capacity by as much as 100% and offer more than 30% better price performance. Our flagship FAS6000 product line performance was also robust, growing units 20% from Q2 a year ago.","Our branded E-series product line continues its ramp, with unit growth more than doubling from last quarter. The branded E-series business showed a healthy diversity of application workloads and sizes in the second quarter. We also took advantage of the outstanding E-series performance characteristics to win a large all-Flash array deployment in a highly competitive bake-off against all the usual suspects. The price\/performance and density profile of the E-series makes it a good foundational building block on which to build dedicated solutions that meet the requirements of extreme workloads. We are pleased to see the booking and pipeline progress over the last few quarters.","Achieving broad account coverage through partner leverage is also key to our strategy, and we have a long history of commitment to the channel. Our OEM and channel business increased 5% from a year ago, growing to 82% of total revenue. Together, Arrow and Avnet grew 12% from Q2 a year ago, contributing 34% of total revenue, an all-time high.","Over the past couple of years, we have had a specific focus on telcos and service providers, and today, our partners offer more than 200 cloud services based on NetApp technology. While our telco service provider business is growing in all geos, the Americas stood out in the second quarter with the telco service provider business almost doubling from Q2 a year ago. Our OEM business was flat from Q1 but down 9% year-over-year, in line with the announcements of several of our OEM partners.","Go-to-market leverage extends to our alliance partners as well. Our focus as a best-of-breed storage provider enables us to create complementary and sustainable strategic relationships with our ecosystem partners. During Q2, we participated in VMworld, Oracle OpenWorld and Citrix Synergy and announced integration with each of these company's latest offerings.","Also in the second quarter, we expanded our FlexPod solutions to include Express pod, an entry-level version, as well as support and validation for VMware Vsphere unclustered ONTAP. Our FlexPod business continues to grow rapidly. November marks the second anniversary, and now we have more than 1,500 FlexPod customers, almost quadruple the number a year ago. The idea behind FlexPod is to lower the barrier to acceptance of new technology through deep integration of technology and support with other best-of-breed vendors. Beyond just infrastructure, FlexPod extends to applications as well with notable integrations with Microsoft, VMware, Red Hat, Citrix, SAP and Oracle.","Overall, despite a different macro backdrop, we demonstrated progress on each of the strategic elements of the business. The acceleration of clustered ONTAP enabling an agile data infrastructure demonstrates the impact of our strategy of having a single operating system serving a broad and ever-increasing set of customer workloads. A single OS for a large set of workloads reduces complexity in customer environments and gives us tremendous development leverage, enabling ongoing organic innovation. For specialized but rapidly growing workloads that are not served by ONTAP, we now have E-series, which is starting to show traction.","To maximize the monetization of our compelling innovation, we have chosen a partner-centric strategy, and we have seen our indirect business grow both in size and as a percentage of our business. Similarly, we are building a set of growing and sustainable ecosystem relationships with NetApp as the core storage provider. Execution on each one of these items will enable us to grow our market share.","Finally, I would like to extend my thanks to the entire NetApp team for, despite the economic headlines, remaining focused on things that we can control: innovation, execution and serving customers. I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to the over 12,000 employees of NetApp for our strong placement in the World's Best Multinational Workplaces list by the Great Place to Work Institute. NetApp's unique culture is a differentiator that helps us produce great results for NetApp customers and partners, and we strive to be a great company with which people want to be associated.","At this point, I will open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shebly Seyrafi of FBN securities.","Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","You did pretty well on the product gross margin. I think you said it was due to more highly configured systems. Can you talk about the outlook going forward? Do you expect that to continue? Maybe you can also touch on tried pricing back at LPU? Specifically can you, for example, stay above 53% going forward?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Shebly, Nick Noviello here. Good to talk to you. So thanks for the question. So on product gross margin, recall that we were at 51.4% last quarter, up to 53.6% this quarter. There's always going to be a combination of things going on. Absolutely, more highly configured systems in the quarters will drive product gross margins north. We've talked in Q1, Q4, Q3 into last year about the impact of drive pricing and the fact that we would expect that drive pricing impact to start mitigating. And it did start mitigating this quarter. There is still a little bit there, but it's nothing like what was there in the prior 3. So there's a combination of things that had impacted us. In addition, I would point out that the branded business was up this quarter, the OEM business was not. So you've got a combination of what we're selling to customers, be it highly configured. You've got OEM versus branded, you've got drive pricing. All of those work together. In terms of what we would expect to go forward, the guidance would anticipate that our product gross margins are at or a little bit above this type of level. So the 53s are in the math, if you will, for the guidance range for the quarter 3. So -- and versus what we showed at our Financial Analyst Day, which was an approximate 55 over time, we feel like we're making progress and expect to continue to make progress towards that over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe a question for Tom, just -- with respect to capacity growth, I think that was still about 16% this quarter, which is way below the long-term trend. And how do you -- I assume the industry is growing much faster than that. How do you explain that? Can you give us any insight as to what's going on? It's just a weird comparison. That would be helpful.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I think -- I don't think that we're an outlier, so I wouldn't be so sure that the industry is growing faster than that. We didn't see a dramatic mix in the type of systems that we sell or in pricing. And you can see in gross margin that, that held up. So I don't see really anything really dynamic in that mix. So I just think that we're looking at a growth rate in this industry that's not as high as it's been in a while. None of the major player storage businesses. In fact, most of them are underwater. So I think growth is lower, and I think you're seeing it reflected there. But I wouldn't say that there's anything specific about our business that has changed that would indicate those -- that you should expect to see something different in that particular dimension. I think the product mix stayed substantially the same, probably more of a skew towards the lower end, which might have a little bit lower capacity, but we've had that skew before. So I think nothing dramatic has changed. Probably just a little bit more of a mix of the lower-end units is probably -- for what impacted the number, that would probably it. But I would say nothing fundamental is different about our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On the product cycle discussion, you talked about the high end of the 3000 series being flat year-over-year. Was there any kind of pause in front of the launch from last week? And also, on top of that, how do we think about the 6000 product cycle, as that would be kind of next in line to be refreshed over the coming quarters or month?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I'm not going to preannounce any products. I really don't think that there was a pause in the revenue, in the face of the new products coming along. I would venture to guess that there was probably some partners and some accounts that may have held off, but I wouldn't say it was material. So I wouldn't bake in some type of depression of last quarter's numbers and some uptick in this quarter's number. I think we see a product refresh. Product refreshes are good for the business. We've certainly seen the impact of the 3000 family refresh as favorable to us, and that's reflected in our guidance going forward. So overall, I don't think that there was a pause. I don't think it had that big of an impact. Probably some, but I wouldn't change the numbers as a result of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray.","Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just wanted to get a little bit more color on the Flash side of your business, particularly since your new hardware has much more Flash integration. So first, is Flash Accel on your resell agreement with Fusion-io driving growth at existing customers? Or are you seeing it gain traction in new accounts?","Thomas Georgens","So Flash Accel, I think, is something we're talking to customers about now, but Flash Accel is not shipping at this point in time. So what we see is the other elements of the portfolio, which are indeed robust. Flash Pool, which we announced last quarter, I believe, and Flash Cache before that. So clearly, the challenge in front of us is how do we optimize price performance. And the way to optimize price performance is put the high utilized data on the Flash and the less utilized data on less expensive disks, typically serial ATA. And I think that's really what we're trying to do. And it's how do we do that, whether it be server-level cache, which is where Flash Accel will fit in; controller-level cache, disc-level cache and the data management to optimize the data placement. So you can have true discrimination of price\/performance between the highly valuable, highly in-demand data and the less important, more archive-oriented data. I think that's the value add that we provide. So as I think about our Flash strategy in the long run, I do believe that Flash will exist at every level of the hierarchy, including perhaps even more levels than currently exist. But overall, I think that in order to not be just a niche product around specific individual workloads, the real challenge is how do I manage the full hierarchy across my enterprise? And from NetApp's point of view is that no matter where the storage lies, whether it be on Flash or hard disk, we want Data ONTAP to be management tool to manage that ultimately and basically optimize the price\/performance infrastructure-wide and ultimately enterprise-wide. So it's kind of how we see it. I think we're excited about Flash. I think we have a lot of momentum, and I think it's actually been a key selling point. And of a lot of our products at this point, it\u2019s in every unit item.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Marshall of ISI Group.","Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It looks like Cache IQ's website, unfortunately, is already being directed back to NetApp, so a fast move on that. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your strategy with respect to how you're going to integrate their appliance, with respect to your NAS offerings and as part of the bigger picture with respect to getting more market share and revenues with respect to your -- the overall company coming from basically the Flash architecture.","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think you should think about Cache IQ as more of a technology tuck-in. We got a talented, proven engineering team, and we have some interesting technology that we want to integrate. So as we think about that technology going forward, it's really more about the intellectual property and how it can be integrated to what we currently sell to really go after certain use cases that we currently have. So as far as a stand-alone product, our primary focus frankly is integration to our broader IP set. So I think -- think about this is a technology tuck-in and a proven, talented engineering team.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Could you maybe just touch on your expectation for the 5% sequential growth in Jan quarter? And specifically, I'm just trying to misunderstand, what do you see in terms of an IT budget flush, and how do you see the public vertical tracking after a fairly good seasonal October quarter for you guys?","Thomas Georgens","Yes. Overall, I think we see the same thing that you see. I think we're fully pleased about how the quarter played out for us, but that doesn't mean that we are seeing the same dynamic that everybody else is seeing. Difficulty getting big deals trends -- closed, obviously. Lengthening of sales cycles. But I think that we haven't been sitting idle. We've been working very, very hard over the last 6 months really to build pipeline, to expand our channel relationships. So I think the macro is the same for everybody. I think that your guess is probably as good as mine. We've got a fiscal cliff, we have Hurricane Sandy rebound. We have all those things, so we took our best guess and rolled it into our forecast. But the other component here is clearly what we see in our own business relative to pipeline, the breadth of our channel. We clearly had very, very strong acceptance of the new product. Our alliance partnership with Cisco has been very, very successful for us. FlexPod, obviously a lot of momentum, and the expansion of our channel. So for us, I think we worked very, very hard on all of those fronts and just plain execute better as a company. So when I look forward, I wouldn't say that we are predicting any better macroenvironment than anybody else. I just think that there are things under our control that we're doing better now than we were 6 months ago, and I think that's what's reflected in the guidance we just gave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes of Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Hey, Tom. Can you just talk a little bit more about the differences in the U.S. and the APAC? I think U.S. government was very strong. How sustainable is that? And then commercial looked like it was kind of weak. And what are you expecting there? Maybe that would pick up with new products. And then APAC, was that below your expectations? And can you discuss that segment as well and what you're thinking for the future? So those 3 segments and the puts and takes.","Thomas Georgens","Yes. I think if you just look at the geographic bookings, last quarter we were up in APAC and down everywhere else. This quarter, from a booking perspective, we were up everywhere. So I think generally modest increase across the board. As far as APAC is concerned, I don't think it's possible to make a general APAC statement. We've got countries that are doing very, very well; Japan, China, good growth rates. We have other regions that are not doing as well. So I think Japan -- Asia Pac is actually very, very uneven for us. And frankly, even in the U.S. I'd say the same thing. I think that there are segments -- I talked about the telco service provider business that has been doing well for us. But beyond that, I would say it's not really that sector-specific. We've got companies in sectors that are doing well with us and companies that aren't doing well. So it's very, very uneven. And I'd say that's probably the trend around the world. As far as government spending, I think U.S. government spending was better than a lot of people had feared, but it wasn't like it was up 20% either. So I think we'll stay in this range. We'll see how this fiscal cliff plays out. But I'm not really expecting it to get worse than where it is today. I think government spending is going to be aggressive across the board no matter how the fiscal cliff plays out, and I don't think it's going to take another step down from here. On a global basis, I would say that government businesses globally are probably a little bit more challenging and probably not as little -- not as stable as the U.S. government. So overall, I expect unevenness. I expect to see our big accounts to have an account-by-account story. The telco service providers remain strong. I think Cisco said something similar last night. And Asia Pacific, similarly, I think country-by-country. And I'd say the same about Europe. I think one of the things that helped us is while the Southern European countries are important to our strategy in the long run, they are not big contributors to the number today. And I think we've been doing better in the mature environments, U.K., France and Germany in particular, and I think that's helped us ride it through. On a constant-currency basis, we were up 7% year-over-year in EMEA. And I think under the circumstances, that's a pretty strong performance.","Nicholas R. Noviello","And Ben, it's Nick. I would add to that, and Tom talked about several areas. Consistent with what we've done here, we forecast a go forward at a very granular area-based methodology around the world, around all of those sectors, around all of those selling geographies that we present to you, build that up and then look at it as well from a top-down perspective with the macro. So we bring all of those pieces together in terms of the guidance we give and the guidance we gave you this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Was wondering, is there any reason that you saw, for the more rigidly config-ed systems this quarter, any change in customer behavior of note?","Thomas Georgens","No. I wouldn't say anything had really changed. I think some of our -- I could see a few things in the mix relative to certain customer activity, but I wouldn't say that anything dramatically has changed. And I'd say that's probably within a statistical range. I think it bounced back next quarter. But all things considered, I think that the product mix was typical of our Q2.","Operator","Our next question comes from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo.","Maynard Joseph Um - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If you could just talk a little bit about your M&A strategy, particularly in terms of how aggressive you expect to be, maybe over the next year or so? And then how do we think about the revenue generation model for any potential acquisitions? Are they more IP, acquisitions that you talked about like Cache IQ, to help drive differentiation of the existing products? Or should we think of acquisitions as being more materially revenue generating?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I think in the original category of the technology tuck-in, I think you should expect to see -- do those and do those continuously. In fact, just as we get bigger, you'd probably see them at a modestly increasing rate. So I think as we get bigger, you'll continue to see us do technology tuck-in-type acquisitions and things to kind of expand our portfolio and integrate with our core technology. I think that will continue at a roughly regular pace, probably slightly increasing over the past, simply because of our size. As far as bigger acquisitions that are material to the revenue flow, I think those are going to be asynchronous events that are going to be very opportunistic in nature. That'll be a function of availability. That'll be a function of price. That'll be a function of executability. So I wouldn't say that the pace of those will either pick up or decline. I just think there they're going to be very, very opportunistic in nature, and our stance regarding those has not changed. So tuck-in acquisitions, I think you should continue to expect them perhaps at a slightly increasing pace. As far as bigger deals that are material to the revenue stream in the near term, I would expect those to be very opportunistic and they could happen or not happen. And I wouldn't put any frequency number on that, nor would I assume that our strategy has changed if we don't do one in a while.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Shope of Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So can you give us a little more color on demand linearity in the quarter? As you know, many of your enterprise peers have noted considerable incremental weakness in the month of September. I guess first of all, did you see that in the month of September? And in October, did you see any signs of stabilization or rebound that helped you to put up the numbers you did?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I'd say first -- well, I look at the numbers constantly. And constantly means many, many, many times a day. And we primarily look for, at least what I look for, is basically year-over-year performance. But I would say that I would not apply too much science to that methodology, and there's still a lot of variability at deal timing and calendarization and things of that nature. If I had just a general trend, I would say that the quarter started a little slow and finished stronger. But I probably would not want to put any more color to it than that. And as far as a specific slowdown in September, we did not see that. But like I said, I would not apply too much scientific rigor to our data points. But generally, we finished stronger than we started.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Craig of Bank of America.","Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Tom, can you delve into the channel a little bit more? Like when you look at Arrow and Avnet, they're obviously outperforming the sort of other partner, so to speak. Are they doing anything specific that you can work on with the other partners? Or is it you directing more funds to them? How should we think about that channel dynamics there between Arrow and Avnet and the others?","Thomas Georgens","So I think there's a few things at play. One of them is their investment in the business. As they seek for growth engines to their business, they need to look who in their partner base they believe they can get some leverage from. And then how could we work together to go after that? So I think that we've put together some activities with both Arrow and Avnet. And as a result of what we've been seeing, that I think they're starting to pay dividends for us. I think -- from another point of view, clearly, some of that business is business that they generate. Some of it is migration of existing partners to them. So there's a balance of that as well. I think that overall, we're completely committed to the fact that our business is looking to get leverage and leverage out of our partner community. And I think that there's a lot of trust that's been built up over the years, and there's a lot of ability to co-invest over the long term with those guys. So I think as we look to what are we going to do to expand our channels, clearly we've seen competitive threats from other people that we needed to respond to in a constructive way. And I think we've been a lot of that. And our big objective last quarter was to build pipeline. And one of the ways we do that clearly is in our direct accounts, but also just getting more leverage through our channel partners. So I would say that it's not a coincidence that it's increased. It's been an area of focus. It's been an area of investment, and they certainly have done a good job with us. And as we look for opportunities to grow, clearly their coverage helps us. And likewise, as they look for opportunities to grow, they're looking for a technology provider that they can basically be successful with, with their account base. So I think both of those have happened. And it's not just there. Clearly, internationally as well, working on expanding our channels and our channel relationships. And clearly, the OEM business as well. So I think overall, it isn't a statistical anomaly. I think we've worked very, very hard on a number of fronts over the last 6 months, and I think we're starting to see some impact.","Operator","Our next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Tom, you grew capacity, shipped about 16%. You commented earlier that you don't think the industry growth rate was that different. But customers are talking about 30%, 40%, 50% growth in data. So at some point, they need to catch up with the growth in their business. Do you have a sense, based on history, how long they can delay storage hardware orders before they just -- they have to spend to catch up?","Thomas Georgens","Well, I don't want to say forever. But I think the simple fact of the matter is, is that storage spending at the end of the day is budget-limited. It's not capacity-limited. I don't know if I've ever met a company that stored every bit of storage they wish they could store. They store what they can afford to store. And when they're under budget pressure, they will make other trade-offs, one of which is to turn on more of our storage efficiency technology. We certainly saw that to a great extent in the last downturn, and I'm certain we see it to some extent this downturn. So that would be one of the things, is basically fully leverage the technology they've already bought. The other side of that clearly is that they keep data around for less periods of time or keep data on top, keep less copies of the data. And the consequence of that is the utilization of the data, whether it be for data warehousing or decision-making or decision-support or things of that nature. So at the end of the day, I think that yes, there's a natural data growth of the creation of new data. But that doesn't mean that spending goes up automatically. I can speak from a CEO's perspective, we don't sit around and say we love to invest in R&D, we love to invest in sales and marketing but we can't because we have to spend money on storage. What's more likely is we invest in our priorities and then hand the budget down to IT. So I do believe that storage is a consumable. And as a result, it puts enormous pressure on IT in that scenario. So I do expect that storage will outperform the other sectors within IT, but I wouldn't pretend that storage can overpower IT spending indefinitely. So I do believe that IT spending does modulate storage spend. But I do also believe that storage would be a disproportionate amount of the IT spend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When we look at your commentary about you're seeing kind of what everybody else is seeing out there for IT spending, can you just comment a little bit about -- is that consistent with some IT professionals deferring or delaying some Q2 purchasing? And on the same vein of the last question, is it just a matter of time, like 2 quarters, where historically they have to come back to spend? Or are you seeing any deferrals? And if so, could that help your forward guidance maybe in a quarter or 2?","Thomas Georgens","No doubt that there is deferrals of deals, particularly big deals. And to be fair, we certainly had deferrals last quarter into the quarter we just recorded. So there is clearly some of that flow going on. And the other dynamic is people will buy the minimum necessary to continue to advance their business, and that will drive some migration towards smaller systems. And I think we've seen that also. So as I think about the business, clearly, IT people are under pressure, storage being a consumable. I think utilization rates are going up. And I would agree that eventually, that pressure has to be released. And the question is, will it be released all at once or a little at a time? So I think that will be a function of the overall IT spending umbrella. So I see a lot of scrutiny on big deals and a lot of delays in deals and a lot of movement towards buying just incremental capacity and keep doing what we're doing. So I think all of those things are in play. So I think at some point, that we'll have to relax. And then certainly, when we see some light at the end of the tunnel from a macro perspective, I do expect a lot of pent-up demand. But I believe that we're going to have to see some economic vitality before that becomes a material impact on the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian White of Topeka.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Tom, last night, Cisco highlighted a closer relationship with NetApp in the future. And I'm just wondering, how do you see this relationship evolving over the next 12 to 8 months? And I just want to be clear; today, you're really focused on FlexPod with Cisco. Or is there something else?","Thomas Georgens","I think the most visible thing clearly is FlexPod. There are other products in the Cisco portfolio that NetApp is working with. But what Cisco -- but FlexPod is primarily the big public one that we see. I think we said from the beginning that -- first of all, Cisco and NetApp, I think, are more aligned on technology around storage than some of the other players. I think clearly we see Ethernet-based storage as something that's one of our core competencies and something that we want to promote. And likewise, the same with Cisco. So I think in that perspective, from a technology perspective, we're very, very much aligned. I think from a channel perspective, being that both companies have substantial partner relationships and were primarily indirect, I think we have a lot of synergy in terms of our go-to-market. And I think we've helped them with channel partners that we've had that are now stronger with Cisco. And certainly, the reverse is true where our previous Cisco channel partners who didn't have a lot of interest in storage are now big parts of our go-to-market strategy. And I think the last piece, which we can't be lost on this either, is that I think our focus and our domain is not overlapping with Cisco's strategic intent for a fair period of time. So I think the likelihood of conflict is lower. And therefore, I think there's more sustainability in this relationship also. So I think we're better aligned from a technology vision. I think we're better aligned from a channel vision. And I think there's also sustainability simply because of our different areas of focus. So I think all of those things are not lost on them. But all the strategy talk is all well and good, but I think having 1,600 customers in 2 years and quadrupling year-over-year with FlexPod, that gets a lot of people's attention. So I think more than anything else, I think just a raw business motion says that there is an affinity between the 2 companies and that together, we can make business happen that we couldn't make happen on our own. And I think that's driving this very, very strongly. So I'm excited about where we're going with Cisco. I expect to see more investment from both of us on this. I expect to see us integrating with even more software vendors to basically deliver more complete solutions. And yes, there are other elements of Cisco's portfolio that we're working with them on, on the media space and things like that, that I think will be interesting as time goes on. But in the near future, it's really about FlexPod and expanding that ecosystem.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Alexander of Raymond James.","Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Nick, could you talk about your appetite to increase the pace of the buyback, given the $1.5 billion authorization and your healthy cash balance? I think about $2 billion in the U.S. as of this quarter, how should we think about the cadence relative to last year, which was really front-half loaded? And if you do refi that convert next year, would you get more aggressive on the buyback or is that really mutually exclusive?","Nicholas R. Noviello","Yes, okay. Thank you, Brian. So a couple points just to keep in mind. 6 months year-to-date, we've done just under $350 million in share repurchase. Our authorization was down to about $148 million, so we re-upped with the board the authorization. And I made -- I mentioned in the prepared remarks about a substantial amount of repurchase over a period of time. In terms of the go-forward, repurchase is one of the things we do in our capital allocation strategy and philosophy. I went through in our Financial Analyst Day in June the approach we've taken from the periods FY '07 to '12 and shown balance really in capital allocation, with the most important piece being investing in the business. And then investing through capital purchase and acquisition and then repurchase and return of capital to shareholders. We want to be able to do all of those things. This repurchase authorization is just another part of the puzzle. Our primary strategy is to ensure that we offset any dilution from employee issuance and employee plans, that is the primarily strategy. However, we reserve to do more or less as value or time permits or other things happen. So we want to be able to do all those things. Your point on the debt, that is something that's coming. We know that the period ends in June, and we know that we have -- we will be retiring that convertible note. And then we have a variety of options, basically retiring it as is and\/or then going out and re-upping debt. Frankly, every one of those things are available to us. We're going to maintain that stance. And as we move forward, we'll let you know what our plans are.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","As you know, there have been some concerns about the company recently, and I wonder if you'll take this opportunity to perhaps refute some of these concerns or even myths. And just to pick a few, one would be that EMC is giving you trouble on the channel. So people are concerned with their mid-range week this quarter, you would see it, which you didn't particularly. Another would be a concern about Flash. Do you feel disadvantaged in your Flash products portfolio or not? And third would be that a number of these start-ups would seem to be going after you first because it's a lower SAP, they tend to sell through the channel. Some of them are former NetApp executives. Just curious if you\u2019d care to respond to some of these concerns.","Thomas Georgens","Okay. And yes, I guess I could add a bunch more. Certainly, it was a complicated quarter in terms of derivative indicators on NetApp, whether it be partners or suppliers or channel relationships, as we go through those. So first and foremost on the channel, I mean clearly, EMC has entered the channel primarily to basically manage the unwind of the Dell relationship, right? The Dell relationship was key to that strategy. EMC had to basically claw that business back somehow. We clearly see them in the channel, and we push in that direction. On the other hand, if you look at the channel momentum and the product cycle through the channel, that's really where the volume and the \"big wolf\" has been. So do we see them? Absolutely. Are they slowing us down? Clearly, there's a competition out there. But at the end of the day, I think the numbers speak for themselves, and I think we're doing quite well in that particular dimension and I think we're more than holding our own. The Flash strategy, frankly, I guess I would come back to what is exactly is it that they think -- you think they have that we don't. I think that we opened up early about our belief that the primary deployment of Flash in the storage system is in the form of a cache, and I think we opened with that. And we saved ourselves, going down some paths that didn't pan out for our competition, and we turned it into an every unit item and a key differentiator for us. So I think we were right on the technology, we're right on the strategy. I think we executed well. I think more broadly, Flash in the host. I think, just to be really clear what our goal here is, our goal here is to bring things into the data management framework of Data ONTAP. So I think selling PCI plug-in boards at that level, we will do that if necessary, and we will partner with people to do that if necessary. But our end game here is that storage, no matter where it lives, whether it be solid state or hard disk drive, wants to be part of the data management portfolio. And clearly, you'll see other innovation for us going forward. You've seen Flash Pools, which now has hundreds of customers, and that's working out really well for us. So for us, I don't think that we're losing any business because of the Flash story because I don't see what the competitor has that we don't. There will be more instantiations of Flash as time goes on. I think you should expect us to participate in those. And we expect Flash to be an integral part of the story, and it'll be a key for us is integrated with everything else that we do to create a compelling data management that's enterprise-wide for the end user. And I forgot the last one...","Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Oh, start-ups.","Thomas Georgens","I think the start-ups are out there. I think that, not surprisingly, given NetApp's history and entrepreneurial culture, that some NetApp people will go to those. Some people need to scratch that start-up itch, and I get that too. And they're out there and we see them, and we're fighting them aggressively. But I think in the grand scheme of things, though, as we think about how the near to intermediate term plays out, I think winning and gaining share against the traditional market share players is really what's going to determine the trajectory over the next several quarters, and that's really where our focus lies. So you understand the little guys are out there. We certainly have an understanding of what their strengths and weaknesses are, and we are fighting them and taking them seriously. But it's really the major mature players that's really where the battle is and that's where we intend to gain share.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jayson Noland of Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Tom, you mentioned a couple hundred cloud services now on NetApp. I wanted to ask about cloud gateways, Microsoft SPOT recently in this category would NetApp offer at gateway? And I recognize it's early days, but kind of your thoughts on Tier 2 data, et cetera, going off to the cloud on the back of the gateway?","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I think let's start with the telco service providers in general. And probably a couple of years now, we went out and we formed a vertical, very, very field-focused team to focus on the telcos and the service providers as a fundamental strategy for us. And part of that is to sell into those accounts as typical end users. But the other part is really to go after the service provider business. And in some ways, that has a bit of a OEM feel in that you basically work a while to actually achieve a design in, basically get the design into their architecture, get design into that product set in parallel with their intellectual property development. And that eventually moves to a sell-through where actually they generate paying customers and the volume actually picks up. And I think we're seeing some of that with the 200. It isn't like they all happened last quarter. They've been a long time in make -- in the process. And now they're out in the market. Some will be successful and some aren't, but we're actually seeing material volume from quite a few of those, and those are helping our business. But the seeds of that business were sown quite some time ago. And I think that the work that we've done around creating a telco service provider vertical and field-focused team was really to kind of set the stage for that early on. I think we're starting to see that result. And it's a long lead time, and fortunately we're patient enough to see it, and I think we see some momentum there. As far as the role of the cloud, I think that we're looking at all different types of options, whether it be backup to the clouds, disaster recovery to the cloud, managing the hybrid cloud, some combination of on-trend off-trend data. So I think there are a lot of models that are emerging, including cloud gateways and the store simple case that you talked about. I think it's safe to assume that the cloud will be part of the storage hierarchy of every major customer eventually. And I think it will be to varying degrees, whether it be for proof of concepts or surging or archiving or backup. And I think that being able to work with specific NetApp products and also with our service providers to bridge that, with NetApp content on both ends, is an actual part of our server provider strategy, and is a big part of those 200 design wins that we talked about. So I agree with you that the cloud gateways are going to be important, but I think they are one of many integrations with the cloud to create a hybrid cloud for end users.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rajesh Ghai of Craig-Hallum Capital.","Rajesh Ghai - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on this answer and understand the strength in the telco service provider vertical that you earlier alluded to and related to the slowdown that you have seen in the overall storage market in 2012. With workload for the enterprise increasingly migrating to the cloud, are you concerned that the demand for this service provider vertical is not completely replacing the demand that may be lost on the enterprise side? And now to an association with OpenStack Foundation, does that help you with that vertical, especially given that your top competitor is not involved in that right now?","Thomas Georgens","Yes, I wouldn't say -- as I -- as we look at the service providers and we look at the business that they're providing, I wouldn't say that that's a direct siphoning off of our enterprise business in that direction. I think if we were a dominant market share player, then it would be sort of a conservation of storage, and if it goes one place or the other. But I think that most of the service provider activity that we're doing is incremental to our enterprise business, so I wouldn't make that linkage necessarily. I think that overall, the amount of activity for our enterprise providers, particular around traditional business applications, is still primarily an on-premise activity. I think if they look to the cloud, they're looking for proof of concepts, they're looking for speculative projects, they're looking for bursting of capacity and to the extent that they're going to the cloud today, it's really around archiving and other types of things. So for us, I think that cloud is part of the hierarchy, but I don't necessarily think it's straining off the NetApp workloads. The NetApp workloads, which have high I\/O capability, those are going to tend to stay on-premise at least to the big enterprises at least today. So overall, I think that the service provider business is substituting some of the enterprise, but I don't think it's anywhere close to a 1-for-1, or even worse than that is actually generating some subtraction of capacity. I just don't think that that's the case. As far as open stack, I think clearly it's in our best interest as an ecosystem developer and also working with these other players to embrace that technology and also to enable it. I think NetApp has always been a standard space player. And I think as people build cloud services, if we can integrate tightly with that and enable them to accelerate to bring in their products to market, that makes sense for us. I think we can debate where OpenStack is in its maturity curve and how ready it is for prime time. But I do know that a lot of the service providers and a lot of the co-development activity we are doing with service providers, a fair amount of it is, in fact, with the OpenStack framework.","Operator","Our final question for today will come from Bill Choi of Janney.","William H. Choi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Can you address the weakness in the direct business that we've seen in the past 2 quarters? I found it particularly interesting that you talked about building the pipeline with the direct. Do you have a much bigger confidence about the direct business coming back? And is there any sort of bigger, unusual backlog build that occurred here into the next quarter?","Thomas Georgens","On the backlog question, no.  And -- backlog and all those things sort of calculated into the guidance that we give. One thing I would say about the channel is a substantial amount of our business that goes through the channel is demand created by our own people. And probably the classic example of that would be our U.S. Public Sector business. So on the federal side, just about every bit of that business is actually fulfilled through a channel partner. So that business is almost 100% channel, yet in terms of the big transactions, our people are involved. So I wouldn't associate the direct and indirect with touch and low touch. We're involved in a lot of accounts, we engage channel partners, and our expectation for them is that they will take that help and ultimately leverage it in other deals where NetApp is not involved. But March transactions, whether they get fulfilled or not through the channel, have a substantial amount of our own direct people here. So in terms of weakness of direct, I'm not quite sure I would convey that terminology. I don't think I would agree with that. I will say that the big accounts in general are going to look like the macro overall, which is not that impressive. So I think that the growth of the big accounts will tend to be slower than the rest of the business, certainly in the areas where we can do substantial channel expansion. So overall, I think we're probably better covered in the big accounts, so therefore, the commerce expansion there is probably not as great for us. But on the channel, I know that there's substantial numbers of accounts that are out there, particularly in mid-sized business, that have no contact with NetApp or NetApp agents at all, and that's one of the things we want to go after. So basically, I don't really necessarily look as much at the direct versus indirect business. I basically look at the performance of the individual accounts in the large account program and I look at the performance of a broad portfolio of accounts in mid-sized business. And that's more or less how I look at the business, independent of channel.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time.
