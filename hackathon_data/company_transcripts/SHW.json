With us on today's call are John Morikis, President and CEO; Sean Hennessy, CFO; Al Mistysyn, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Bob Wells, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications.","This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at sherwin.com beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes and will be available until Thursday, May 12, at 5:00 PM Eastern Time.","This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. Federal Securities Laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the day on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions.","I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Jessie. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. In the interest of time, we provided some balance sheet items and other select financial information on our website, sherwin.com under Investor Relations, April 21 press release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the first quarter 2016 compared to the first quarter 2015, and then comment on each reportable segment.","Consolidated net sales increased 5.1% to a record $2.57 billion, driven primarily by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and Consumer Group. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 2.8% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $129.3 million in the quarter to $1.26 billion.","Our consolidated gross margin increased 280 basis points in the quarter to 49% of sales from 46.2% in the first quarter last year. Most of the gross margin improvement in the quarter resulted from the positive mix effect of Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, outpacing the growth of the other segments, coupled with increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume.","Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $73.2 million over the first quarter last year to $1 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 38.9% in the first quarter this year, from 37.9% last year. Roughly half of this increase was from acquisition-related costs.","Interest expense increased $13.3 million compared to the first quarter last year to $25.7 million. This increase resulted from the shift to long-term debt from short-term that occurred mid-year 2015 and acquisition related interest expense.","Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $23.1 million to $216.4 million, due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $9.4 million or 4.9%, compared to the first quarter last year.","Our effective tax rate was flat at 32% compared to the first quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the low 30% range.","Consolidated net income increased $15.7 million to $147.1 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 5.7% compared to 5.4% in the first quarter last year. Finally, diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 13.8% to $1.57 per share from $1.38 per share in 2015.","Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2016 increased 10.5% to $1.62 billion from $1.46 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 9.4%. All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic paint and equipment sales across all end markets. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter.","Regionally in the first quarter, our Eastern division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division, Southwestern division and Canada. Sales and volumes were positive in every division.","Segment profit for the group increased $77 million or 43.6% to $253.5 million in the quarter, as higher paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 15.7% of sales from 12.1% in the first quarter last year.","For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales stated in U.S. dollars decreased 24.7% to $125.2 million due to unfavorable currency translation and negative volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases.","Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 22.2% in the quarter. Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to a loss of $900,000 in the quarter from a profit of $9.5 million last year.","Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs, and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased Latin America's segment profit $6.2 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was a loss of 70 basis points in the quarter compared to a profit of 5.7% in the first quarter of 2015.","Turning to the Consumer Group, first quarter sales increased 7.5% to $378.1 million. As a reminder, in March, we annualized the start of the initial shipments of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program to Lowe's stores, which was completed by May 1 of last year.","Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $8.6 million to $64 million in the quarter from $55.4 million in the first quarter last year. The profit improvement in the quarter was due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and higher sales volumes. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 16.9% from 15.8% in the same period last year.","For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 3.3% to $454.2 million in the quarter as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 4.7% in the quarter.","First quarter segment profit stated in U.S. dollars increased $9.7 million or 24.9% to $48.6 million, due primarily to decreasing raw material costs and good cost control, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which decreased segment profit $3 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 10.7% from 8.3% in the same period last year.","That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I'll now turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. John?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. First quarter 2016 was a good quarter for Sherwin-Williams from both a revenue and profit perspective. Architectural paint volume growth in North America was the strongest we've seen in the past 10 years or longer. Industrial coatings demand also picked up some momentum in North America and Europe. Even with a 2.8% drag from unfavorable currency translation in the quarter and continued soft market conditions in Latin America, our consolidated sales growth exceeded 5% for the first time since third quarter 2014.","To get a clearer picture of our profitability, you need to back out the acquisition-related costs we recorded in the quarter. Ex acquisition costs, diluted net income per common share increased 31% on sales growth of just over 5%. As a percent of sales, gross profit expanded 280 basis points year-over-year.","Operating profit improved 300 basis points and profit before tax improved 190 basis points. Our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was 48.6%. SG&A was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way as a percent of sales, the result of higher SG&A spending by our Paint Stores Group and the acquisition-related expenses.","Both our domestic operating segments delivered strong results in the quarter. Paint Stores Group recorded double-digit revenue growth in four of the five customer segments we track, led by residential leasing, new residential and DIY. Comparable store sales growth of 9.4% was the strongest comp performance we've seen in the few years. Our optimism is fueled further by our professional contractor customers reporting very healthy order book trends that extend well into the year.","During the quarter, Paint Stores Group opened 20 new stores and closed seven redundant stores. But plan still calls for full year store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada, and Caribbean stand at 4,099, compared to 4,010 a year ago.","Consumer Group's 7.5% sales increase and 110 basis point improvement in the segment profit margin in the quarter, primarily reflected strong results from our national account customers. Sales to commercial, industrial and MRO customers also showed good progress in the quarter. Strong sales growth and volume-driven productivity gains by our global supply chain organization resulted in a very healthy 32% profit margin on incremental sales from our Consumer Group in the quarter.","Unfavorable currency translation continued to weigh on sales and profit performance in our Global Finishes Group and our Latin America Coatings Group. Global Finishes Group did report positive volumes and positive sales in local currencies, driven primarily by improving marketing conditions in North America and Europe. They also managed the expenses very well, resulting in an impressive 240 basis point expansion in segment operating margin.","Sales volumes in most Latin American countries continued to decline, with Mexico standing out as the notable exception. The impact of currency devaluation once again was worse than anticipated in the quarter.","Our net working capital increased in the quarter due to the strong upward inflection of our business in the first quarter, evaluated over the trailing 12 months of sales. This increase in working capital resulted in a net operating cash use of approximately $80 million in the quarter, compared to a use of about $55 million in the first quarter last year.","Our capital expenditure in the quarter totaled $52 million, depreciation was $42.9 million and amortization was $5.8 million. In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million, and amortization of about $30 million.","Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016, as we complete some facility renovation projects. During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On March 31, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares.","As we indicated on our call announcing the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal. This along with the cash required to service the debt after the close, will significantly curtail our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Yesterday, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year.","As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, North American architectural paint demand is strong, driven by a steadily increasing level of residential construction and remodeling activity. As we move into the prime painting season, we're also encouraged by growing signs of a more robust non-residential recovery and improving demand for many industrial products. This growth will continue to be offset to some degree by challenging conditions in Latin America and currency headwinds, particularly in the first half of the year.","Our outlook for second quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase low to mid single-digits percent compared to last year's second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.15 per share, a 9.5% increase at the midpoint compared to last year's record $3.70 per share.","For the full year 2016, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2015 by a low single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are raising our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $12.50 to $12.70 per share compared to $11.16 per share earned in 2015.","Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and now we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Good morning, Ghansham.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, in recent quarters you called out some of the non-architectural end markets within PSG is being challenged. Just curious as to how these markets performed during the first quarter? Just wanted to understand why there was such a meaningful acceleration in 1Q sales trends in that Paint Stores Group have been?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We've spoken about the commercial side that we feel pretty good about that, Ghansham. The area that we've spoken of having some pressure would be the Protective & Marine business. Particularly in the Protective side here, if you break down the areas that are impacted by the oil and gas, that's probably had no significant impact. We have seen other areas that we've increased our focus on start to pay greater dividend, and we are excited about the results that we are experiencing as a result of those impact, of the actions we are taking.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then in terms of full-year sales guidance, I guess, why not raise that higher given your big first quarter and also strong sales guidance for the second quarter, particularly with FX easing as the year progresses. You expect any sort of moderation during the year in PSG?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","No. I think that what we expect is the Paint Stores Group will continue to lead the sales gains for us. I think second quarter is going to be in the same situation we're going to see the Paint Stores Group. I think that the first quarter, many years, we don't even change the guidance after the first quarter because it is the smallest quarter. We did raise the EPS. I think that we'll review it at the end of the second quarter. I think this year, if you remember, I think that Consumer had a very nice first quarter. We'll finalize the load-in -- anniversarying the load-in of the HGTV program, and I think that \u2013 so we've got that sort of a headwind a little bit in the second quarter, specifically about the second quarter, but make no mistake about it. I think the Paint Stores Group is where we've \u2013 as John said in his comments, I think the Paint Stores Group will lead us in the sales gains each and every quarter.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say the customer base that we enjoyed relationships with inside their stores organization are feeling pretty bullish about the outlook this year.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Perfect. Thanks so much, guys.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you, Ghansham.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you. It obviously appears the spring season is already off to a solid start on reconstruction R&R. But can you also comment on the competitive environment in the big boxes and also any preliminary expectations for Infinity?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The big-box environment is always competitive. We expect that our role there is to continue to add value to all of the customers that we serve, and our job is to make sure that we're aligned with their goals and driving customers into their stores. Regarding Infinity, it's our practice to let our customers speak to what their expectations are. We have very high hopes. It's a really terrific quality product in that can, and our expectations would be that's going to be very strong. But, we don't want to get ahead of our customers.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you. And then just a quick follow up. Obviously, it's still early, but do you have any new color on the Valspar approval timeline, now that the process has begun, just any reminder there will be appreciated? Thank you.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we've begun the review process, and when we announced the acquisition, we committed to provide you with updates, and we had material \u2013 if we had material news, we really have no material news to update right now. And I think it's only fair to say that, our thoughts are that when there is a material update that we'll provide that, but given the day-by-day or play-by-play will be a bit much. Our thoughts are to keep you up to speed with material actions.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's appreciated. Thank you very much.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the gross margin? You mentioned the incrementals as they flow through the P&L statement, but the gross margin particularly is pretty fantastic. What should we expect as you go through the rest of the year there?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Bob, this is Sean. I probably should have said that last time I answered, but this is Sean. And when you take a look at how our gross margin was last year, and if you look at the second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter, how strong it was, if you think about the way the raw materials were moving last year, we felt that at the beginning of the year was really where we were going to have to make most of our improvement in the gross profit as a percent of sales and the improvement. We were \u2013 last year we were at 46% in the first quarter, we jumped all the way to 48.8% and then we got to 49% and then over 50% in the last three quarters.","So, we feel good about where our gross margin is. We think that the raws will continue to \u2013 the raws goodness will continue to shrink and we're going to hit at length somewhere later in this year where we expect that that will be negligible, so. We felt that we had to have this kind of an improvement in the first quarter to have improvement throughout the year and we feel good about where we are with the gross profit.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then, maybe related to that, I think last year you talked about in some of the contractor bids there was a little pressure, but you've articulated today some building momentum in those markets as well. Can you characterize how the pricing dynamic is in the professional painter market at the moment?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'd say it's very similar to what we've always expressed and experienced. We have spoken about those larger projects that typically go to bid and are a little more aggressive in pricing. But outside of that I'd say it's always a competitive market and it continues to be and we continue to try to differentiate ourselves, not only with the quality of the product, but the services that we provide. But, we expect that our competition will be out there and we've got to earn every gallon that we sell.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, John.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, fellows.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Duffy.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Question just around raw materials. Could you split them out a little bit, talk about the organic and inorganic side? Obviously with oil moving higher, has there been a material change in how you're thinking about raw materials throughout the rest of the year?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","On the petroleum-based side, we primarily priced off propylene and chemical-grade propylene has averaged around $0.30 a pound for a while now. Barring no major outages in propylene or monomer production, we anticipate a relatively flat polymer pricing market for over the balance of the year probably.","On the titanium dioxide side of the equation, we said on our year-end call that we saw prices kind of flattening, but we didn't see a lot of pressure in supply demand balance. Those fundamentals have pretty much played out as we expected. There is obviously a December price increase announcement that we think may be gaining some traction amongst smaller customers, another price increase announcement has been stacked on top of that. We do believe that it's going to take tight market conditions, or tighter market conditions, for those price increases to gain significant traction. But I think it's safe to assume that we're not going to see further declines in TiO2.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then just on the back of that, if let's say oil moves a little higher and you get a little pressure on raw materials, philosophically as we get into next year, would you guys be able to go out with price increases do you think if raw materials were moving higher?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Duffy, our practice has always been to talk to our customers first. So, if we do that it will be \u2013 we'll talk to you about it after we've shared that with our customers. I think the band that gross margin chart that we often talk to that demonstrates our ability to operate in that band, I think is where I would point you. In areas or times where we've had significant pressure, we've been out with price increases, and I think it also demonstrates the discipline that we have when there haven't been raw material increases for us, not to go out with price increases. And so, our first effort is to mitigate or drive more efficiency and drive down the costs, anyway we can to avoid having to put price increases in. But if we find ourselves in that situation, I think we've also demonstrated our ability to put those effective price increases into the market.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, fellows.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you, Duffy.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Good morning.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just a question on weather. If you look at the last four quarters, particularly the first three, we had some challenges, and then 4Q last year was helpful. This first quarter seemed to be, the feedback we got, was somewhat mixed. So, against all that sort of sequential rollercoastering, where do you think things are now? Do you think the quarter and the performance in the Paint Stores Group is really reflective of sort of state-of-the-art instant demand? Or do you think we're still making up lost gallons from last year, or is there any risk that we pulled some forward from later this year?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think demand in our stores clearly improved from fourth quarter to first quarter. How much if any of that was due to the mild weather in the first quarter is really very difficult to determine. I would say this that we're very encouraged about the comments that we are getting from our customers. They're very bullish about the paint season. As I mentioned in my comments that the discussions that we're having with them, they're feeling very good about the market, and that keeps us very excited and focused on growing with them. So it's hard to say how much if any, but most importantly, their outlook for the year is very positive.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just as a follow-up, the guidance you gave at 4Q presumably included some share repurchases. Is that correct? And if so, could you quantify how much do you think you took out in the new guidance?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I will just tell you that at the beginning of the year we did have share repurchase. I think, the guidance \u2013 when we take a look at \u2013 I'll go back to some of the comments John made in his comments. Our plan has changed. Our plan is to accumulate cash. In prior years, we always utilized that cash, our plan was to utilize 100% of the cash. And this if you think about what we're trying to do with the acquisition and acquire and accumulate cash for that closing of the Valspar deal, implies very little cash is going to be used for buybacks and \u2013 versus you probably \u2013 we're looking at spending another $700 million, $800 million, $900 million on stock. So, it probably was significant. And you can pick what you think the average purchase price would have been for the year.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. We'll do that. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Thank you. John, I just want to go back to your views on the architectural paint market. I know, last year, we had subpar growth about 2%, 2.5%. So, as you look at what your customers are telling you, what kind of gallonage growth do you see for the industry in the U.S. this year? And given that outlook, I'm wondering why you only have mid \u2013 low to mid single-digit sales growth expectations for Q2? I know you're running some tougher Consumer Group comps, but it would seem that, especially with the weather snapback in Q2, that that PSG should have a very strong performance?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And this is Sean and I'll let John talk about the market in total. And I just go back to some of the comments I made earlier about the guidance. I think when you look at the second quarter, we've got other things moving; currency is still going to be a little bit of a headwind. We're going to finally have 100% of the load-in from the HGTV program completed. But, we want to make sure you know that Stores Group is going to be the driver in the second quarter, just like it has been for the last many quarters or so.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And, Don, just, so I'll make sure I get your question right, were you referencing first quarter or second quarter?","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I was referencing second quarter just low to mid single-digit revenue growth, but just wanted to also get your comments on your outlook for the industry architectural volumes for the year as a whole, how much \u2013 we had subpar growth last year, what kind of a growth are you seeing this year?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. We don't forecast those gallons specifically, but I would tell you that in speaking with many of our customers around the country, there is a general sense of confidence and a bullishness that is very exciting to us. Many of them are looking at the book of business that they have and are excited about the outlook for the year. So we're going to be very responsive to them and try to ensure that we're the benefactors of that, but our customers are feeling very good, very good.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Don.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Arun.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. I guess I just wanted to ask that question again. You had very impressive same-store sales growth in the first quarter. You guys have been comping kind of 1.5 times to 2 times the industry, so would you say the industry was up 5% or 6% in the quarter? Or was there something specific that drove you guys well above the industry? And then, do you expect your numbers to kind of continue in that range?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Arun, this is Bob. When we do \u2013 when we estimate industry volume, we typically do so in part by listening to the reports of our publicly traded peers, and along with our volume growth, and triangulating to get what we estimate to be the market growth. For one quarter \u2013 for first quarter, it's a little too early to tell because we haven't seen enough market data yet, how much the market grew in the first quarter. Going forward, our expectations are based not on any macro assumption for market growth. But as John indicated on the feedback that we're getting from our contractor customers on their order book volume.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. We're working very closely with them on the projects that they're looking out and estimating, and many of them have already booked, and they're feeling, as I said, very positive about the year.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","It appears that the industry growth accelerated in the first quarter, but I think it's \u2013 ours certainly did, but it's a little too early to make a call on the industry at this point.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. And maybe you can also just give us an update. Are you seeing the price increases in TiO2? I know you described it's safe to assume that prices aren't going to go any lower. But, why are the producers actually having any success with increases if supply demand is still in your favor? Thanks.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","I think the simple answer to that is because they may be getting some price increases justified solely on the poor financial health of the industry. We do not believe the supply demand fundamentals support the increases that are in the market today. But I \u2013 at the very least I think it's safe to say that the increases in the market \u2013 the announcements that the producers have made have stopped the downward trajectory in TiO2 pricing. We said a few quarters ago that it felt like TiO2 was approaching a bottom and clearly there is a bottom in the market and we think we're there. We would expect flat pricing as probably the best case scenario and whether these price increases gain traction as we go forward, time will tell.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Our TiO2 costs are still down significantly year-over-year because of the downward trajectory over the course of 2015.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. If I could just one more just on the non-paint sales in your Paint Stores, could you just describe what you're seeing there in the spray equipment and so on? Thanks.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Very positive numbers. We're having \u2013 in spray equipment, ladders, applicators, across the line we're having a very good performance. It gives us the confidence about the future.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Arun.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes, good morning.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","John, you mentioned that the contractor order book is quite strong. Is that driven by a residential business with repair and remodel or is it more driven by commercial side of things?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's actually both sides.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Can you drill down a...","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sorry P.J. I thought you were done.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","No, no, I'd just say, can you drill down a little bit on the commercial and industrial side? Thank you.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I'd say that it's on both sides of the business, both the residential and the non-res. The confidence in our contractors and the discussions that we have going with them are very positive on both sides.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","And just as a reminder from previous calls, while it certainly appears that non-residential starts are slowing in late 2015 and early 2016, we are \u2013 our business tracks more closely with project completions. So, we're painting project that were started more than a year ago and the pace of starts in 2014 and the first half of 2015 were very healthy. Those are the projects we're on now. And looking forward if you believe the Dodge forecast, non-res starts should be healthy this year and for the next couple of years.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And a quick question for Sean. Sean, you always said that your costs tend to lag oil prices by two quarters to three quarters. So with this recent move in oil price, do you expect maybe later in the year that you begin to see your costs sort of begin to inch up? Thank you.","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And I think that was what I was trying to imply when the question came up about the gross profit and the incremental profit in the first quarter versus the remainder of the year. Again, we \u2013 gross margins in the first quarter was benefited from the paint volume and our North American supply chain and the mix towards paint service group. The raw material deflation was a material factor, and we think that material factor will continue to diminish as we go throughout the year, and I think a lot of \u2013 the basket in total, which the oil is part of.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","I was curious if you could comment on what impact the timing of the Easter holiday may have had on your sales? Presumably that would have been a drag year-on-year on contractor sales, but maybe a positive for DIY?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think that's a pretty good thought. The DIY I think was probably strengthened by the change from the second quarter to the first quarter, and the contractor and that period we had a couple of days where it was probably depressed because of the Easter holiday.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","And then, I was also wondering if you could comment on the efforts that you're making at Lowe's to get the paint department employees a little more familiar with the HGTV HOME product line? Can you maybe give a little bit of detail on what your expectations for underlying volume growth will be adjusted for the load-in that we're lapping here?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I can certainly talk about our efforts there in Lowe's. We're choosing not to talk about the gallons or forecast or our customer. I think it's only appropriate that we let them speak to those expectations. But that said, our efforts are I think right on track. We have continued to work on training the Lowe's associates and making them familiar with our products. We had a terrific opportunity with the introduction of the Infinity product that you mentioned to get some of the product out into the hands of the Lowe's associates applying some of it, and making them familiar with the product. The process of training them on our entire product line as well as colors continues, and we're feeling pretty good about the momentum that we have there.","Our goal is clearly to \u2013 and has always been to focus on driving customers into all of our customers, and you're asking specifically about Lowe's, our goal is to drive customers into that department, make sure that the employees there are very familiar with every aspect of our product and our color systems, and we think we're well on our way.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious about Consumer, I know there's been some moving parts in there besides Lowe's in the past. But when you break out Lowe's and the load-in and the new products, is there a reason that it's not seeing any sort of organic growth?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually our experience in organic growth, if you \u2013 in Consumer, we had January and February sales this year with no history from Lowe's. As I mentioned in my opening comments that we are experiencing a good traction in many segments within that business unit. So, we're actually feeling very good about the momentum that that business unit has.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","The entire national account category is doing very well. And John also mentioned industrial MRO customers are up year-over-year.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. Thanks. And then, in your 9% or so same-store sales in Paint Stores Group, how much of that was the new SKUs being pushed through the legacy Comex stores?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We feel very good about those stores, and what we said and have said is that, we believe we're going to have a 100% of our purchase price cash and all that would be cash neutral. And actually I think we're going to beat the third quarter. We probably said in the third year anniversary, which would have been this September, we're going to have a 100% of our cash back. We're probably going to be quicker because those stores are doing very well. It's \u2013 but now they're fully integrated, and it's hard for us to breakout results, Comex stores and non-Comex stores, but I can tell you, when you look at the markets they're in, they're doing well.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And I would add to that though, I think it's getting specifically to your question, bringing those high-end products into those stores has been a definite win to those stores in the market and our customers. In many cases, the portfolio of products that they were offering to many of those Comex stores were more focused on the new residential side, less on the DIY side. So, to your point, as we introduce the residential repaint and DIY customers into those stores at the higher end band of our product line, it's certainly helping us as Sean has discussed there.","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And one final point on that Nils. Just keep in mind when you're asking the impact on comps, you're talking about roughly 275 stores on a base of 4,100. So it's not really that significant.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah. Fair point. Thanks. I'll pass it along.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning guys, and congratulations on a solid start to the year.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you, Dmitry.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Couple of questions that I want to follow-up. First of all, when you talk about your Latin American business and obviously it's challenged by all kinds of things. But, I'm interested in sort of which raw material pricing has been going up, I knew that impacted margins. And also, sort of what's your outlook like for the volume performance of that business, it's been comping down volume for a couple of quarters now. Is it sort of industry related or are you deemphasizing growth in that market, sort of kind of what's going on with the volumes there as well as raw material costs?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd like to just talk about the deemphasizing growth question, and then I'll turn it over to Sean. The answer is no. We're not ever deemphasizing growth. There are some things to your point in the market that we can't control and there are a lot of things that we can control, and we're working very hard on those things that we can control to better position ourselves in the market. I'll turn it over to Sean to answer the rest of your question.","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, back to the \u2013 one of the parts you asked about the raw material cost and the cost of goods sold going up in Latin America, it's 100% currency and I'll tell you why. The Global Finishes Group is doing a great job looking for efficiencies and we're doing fine there on the conversion cost. But, Latin America buys the majority of its raw materials in U.S. currency and dollar denominated, and when you look at it, the currencies devaluation has the same effect on the raw materials as inflation.","So the raw materials really are negatively affected by that currency. When you ask about in total what are you thinking about on the conditions down there. We don't expect to see improved economic conditions in the region in 2016. I think we've been consistent with this for a long time. I mean, we think that applies to currency and volume demand. We're starting to see currencies change a little positively. The Brazilian real went from about R$4.10, we thought it could get close to R$4.25, now it's down in the R$3.50, R$3.60. But in U.S. dollars, are very close to the breakeven levels. And so, our plan for 2016 calls for this segment to report a profit, but lot is done outside the realm of possibilities, and there's a risk of negative results for one or two more quarters just like the first quarter.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got you. That's helpful, Sean. Switching quickly to Stores Group. Since you've increased your Canadian exposure there, there's been a little bit of a foreign exchange headwind there. Can you talk about sort of what the magnitude of that was in the first quarter?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I can tell you exactly. I think that \u2013 just give me a second here, Dmitry. I thought I had it right here. All right, yeah. It was \u2013 it's very small, it was just over $4 million, three-tenths of a percent of sales, but...","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay.","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So we're pretty happy the way Canada is going, Bob in his remarks, so Canada is coming on for us pretty good.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We've got a good team up there, dedicated on Canada, Western Canada with the influx of the acquisition of General [Paints] has given us a new platform up there, a lot of competition up there as well. But we're working hard in earning our space there.","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Got you. Thank you very much, gentlemen. That's all the questions I had.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you, Dmitry.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.

Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you, Chuck.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","I'd like to just revisit the Paint Stores Group performance a bit, 9% comps growth. Any help in price per gallon there either from a few price increases getting through or the average price per gallon sold, improving maybe because the industrial is getting stronger?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You know, Chuck, when you look at it, just want you to know we haven't really had a price increase in Paint Stores Group since 2014. So the price did not help us at all. The deterioration of what was happening to us last year because of the Protective & Marine, John's comments earlier told you, we didn't have as much of a headwind there. But it was just solid volume growth there.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","All right. Do you think any of that's market share growth, could the market have been growing that strongly?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We believe, I think we believe if you take a look at it, I think we'll know later in the year. Bob mentioned when some of the other public companies may \u2013 we'll get there and look at their results, but we feel pretty good about the way that Paint Stores Group has developed with the products, the distribution and people. We feel pretty good that we're taking market share.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There's some pretty good programs, Chuck, that we're executing on very well. And I have to hand it to our leadership team there as well as our team in the field. They're doing a terrific job of really by market finding those customers that offer opportunity and really earning their business. And we're proud of that team and expect that it's going to continue, that momentum will continue.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","John, are you speaking of the field reps, and is that reflected in the somewhat higher SG&A spending, I think Sean mentioned earlier?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we do have some stores that have an annualized and reps. So, we're investing in there because we're feeling very good about the momentum that we have. So, yeah, I'm speaking to the new reps and new stores, but that's a big base. We've got a lot of stores and sales reps that have been out there for some time, and they're really embracing the new programs and initiatives that we have to grow market share as well as introducing our new products to our customers, who are responding favorably.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","All right Thank you.

Please proceed with your question.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking. Real quick, what were the gross profit changes in the segments?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Give me a second, I got it right here. Paint Stores Group was up $122 million. Consumer was up $15 million. Global Finishes was up $5.2 million and Latin America was actually negative $12.7 million.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then environmental costs were bumped up. Is there anything special in there or is it just sort of the timing of how these things flow through?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Actually, we had an accrual for the Passaic River, it was specifically the Passaic River, there was, I think, negotiations going on between the EPA and the consortium of companies that will be involved in the clean-up. We're a very, very, very small piece, and there was a major change in what the clean-up on the Passaic River is going to be. So even though we're less than 5% player in this Passaic River, all of a sudden we have increased our accrual by $17 million. So you could imagine the total cost went up dramatically. And so the plan is now in place and we'll start doing it, and we believe we have the majority of the expense for the Passaic River now covered.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And you may have said this in the beginning of the call and I may have missed it, I apologize if I did, interest expense. Are you planning on issuing any debt before Valspar closes, and do you expect the interest expense to sort of maintain where it's at right now, or how do you expect debt to go up and down?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right. I think that we do not plan on issuing debt before the close. We've put our bridge in place. We've put a term loan in place; so our acquisition financing is in place. The first quarter, you see the expense was really more involved with the bridge financing. But the second quarter and beyond, we're going to have the term loan in there also. So that's why acquisition financing is in place.","What we have done is put some interest rate swaps, I mean treasury rate locks and so, in the Q, you're going to see that we've entered into a series of treasury rate locks on a confined notion amounts of $1.7 billion. We will go higher than that. So we have taken some of these interest rate changes risk off the table and throughout the year depending on the say, you'll see us take some more off the table.","Ivan M.

Good morning, everyone.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Good morning, Rosemarie.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","If I \u2013 Sean, if I understood you properly, you have made up the gap in the gross margin in the first quarter, and if we keep the following three quarters at a flat level with last year, then we should be higher for the full year. So do you \u2013 is that more or less the trends you're expecting or do you think that Q2 gross margin will still be above last year?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think that we should have a slight positive, we will be positive in the second quarter. I think for full the year, I think that we \u2013 your characterization of flat to \u2013 we in that area, I think that after the second quarter, after we see some raw materials I think we can give you a better picture on what we think the gross margins, we'll narrow it down. But, I think, your characterization of the full year is probably pretty good.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thanks. And you mentioned that you were focusing on other areas outside of the oil and gas industry and were successful. Could give us a better feel for what you are doing and where?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would just say that we look at the industrial business regularly and we try to find those opportunities that offer us both the \u2013 opportunity to move gallons, but also bring solutions to our customers and we've really identified some of those that that we really have some unique technologies too that help provide solutions in getting the assets back in service quicker, to provide protection against various ambient conditions and we have good momentum. Rosemarie, I'd rather not get into any of the specifics of where they are, we'd rather just put the points on the scoreboard right now.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Sure. And if we look at your existing customers in that category and, I'm thinking the Deere, the Caterpillar type of companies. Are you seeing an improvement there or are we still in the doldrums?","John G.

So, exterior were strong.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","So, Sean, within the guidance maybe just help us to see that, that \u2013 potentially that normalizes, how do you guys think about that? Is there still easy comparables through the balance of the year or is there some risks that some of that got pulled forward?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We've been talking about this and it's interesting. You go back to after last second quarter last year, if you remember, because of the weather in the second quarter and so forth and we saw a really nice comp gain in the fourth quarter, and people talked about the weather there, this quarter, you've heard different customers say that they had the opportunity to catch up and including builder. So, we're sort of interested in that situation. I think the second quarter is going to draw \u2013 give us a complete vision of that.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But I would say, going back to the comments I made earlier, Scott, that the takeaway that I have, or the confidence that I have revolves around the book of business that these customers are referencing as to going forward. So, to Sean's point, we may have had some that got pushed back, we may have had actually some that got pulled forward, but they are feeling good about what they're looking on the pipe and they're saying, it looks good.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Great.

Our next question is coming from the line of Jay McCanless with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","Good morning, everyone. Just one quick question. With the flooding that we've seen in Huston and some of the heavy rains we continue to see in Texas, what impact have you all seen from that yet, and could you maybe quantify what Texas in that part of the world means for the Paint Stores Group?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it's impacted our business as we've had stores and customers impacted naturally. Texas is a good part of our business. We've a good representation there and good distribution of stores. I don't know right now what the \u2013 how to quantify that for the years. There will be some slowdown in the near term, and then there will be a pick up on the other side as repairs are done. So it's hard to say in a year how that will impact us. Obviously, in the very short-term when you have stores closed, Jay, the obvious that those stores being closed will impact it, but on the other side, we'll pick up some business as repairs are done.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Robert J.

Please proceed with your question.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions. I just \u2013 if you could update us on your guidance for raw materials. If I remember how \u2013 at the beginning of the year, you thought for the full year, the industry will be down. Do you think that's still the case and have you changed at all as part of your updated guidance? And then I have a follow-up.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Greg, this is Bob. We have not changed our outlook for raw materials. As a reminder, to put a little finer point on it, we expected raw materials for the full year to be down low mid-single-digits. So below \u2013 less than 5%, but in the mid-single-digit range. That's for the full year. And 1Q was at the high end of the mid-single-digit range, because we're annualizing full year declines from 2015. So, actually most of the savings year-over-year are already locked in based on the history that we're going up against last year. We think the price of many of the raw materials that we've used have stabilized, but the benefit \u2013 and so the benefit will diminish as we go through the year, but the benefit is already locked.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI","Got it. And then the \u2013 I guess two other questions, one on Global Finishes, and a little bit of housekeeping. Remind me how you do leap day? Is that in the comp, not in the comp, is it in the total sales? And then Global Finishes, I know you took some great cost out there, but how much longer can sales not grow and profits grow?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think, first of all, you know the comp stores are the Paint Stores Group that we don't report any type of comp metric for the Global Finishes Group. I think that again we feel very good about, operationally, what we're doing there. I think that what helps there, and I think it goes back to John's comments, we've \u2013 if you compare it to the Latin America group, our volume has been good. When you look at the total, the volume has been good, and so when we get volume, we get the opportunity to basically increase that margin. So, I would say it's not going to be \u2013 we definitely and we've talked about over the years, we need some more market share in the Global Finishes Group to really get it kicked and going, but because of the volume gains, they've been able to get margin improvement.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI","And so basically FX took sales down a little bit, but you had some sales growth, and that was enough to get that nice margin expansion?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. Yes.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI","Okay. And just to be clear, was there an extra day in the quarter because of May or February 29?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","When you put everything together, the February 29, was there, but we also had Easter and we \u2013 going back there was an extra day, but Good Friday, just because of the way things are, never, never that week is Friday is never the same as a normal Friday. So moving that Good Friday into the first quarter here is why I answered the question earlier. Yeah, we got a day, but it just felt like it was negated by the Easter move.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI","I got it. Thanks a lot. Great job.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. I had a longer-term question. The Valspar SEC filing indicated that there was a second company that whoever acquired Valspar might also be interested in acquiring the other company as well, but it indicated Sherwin-Williams wouldn't be able to acquire the other company. Would that simply be size or do you think maybe after you pay down some debt from the Valspar deal, you might have an opportunity to do another significant transaction?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think \u2013 first, we don't know who that company was and that's not something that we would want to comment on without having that information, John.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I was fishing, obviously, but since it's out there, I apologize, I'll give it a try...","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks for your honesty.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thank you. Good quarter, guys.","Robert J.

[Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Chris Connor.","Christopher M. Connor","Thank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. The company finished 2011 on a very solid footing, and 2012 was off to a strong start. We're looking forward to sharing these results with you and taking your questions. But before we get to that, let me take a moment to comment on an important change in our reporting structure. ","This morning, the company filed an 8-K announcing the change in our reportable operating segments. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2011, we increased our reportable operating segments from 3 to 4 due to the continued revenue growth, geographic expansion and end-market diversity of our Global Finishes Group. The Latin American Coatings Group, previously aggregated within the Global Finishes Group, will now be reported as a stand-alone segment. The remaining Global Finish Group businesses, mainly automotive finishes, our OEM product finishes, and protective and marine coatings will make up the Global Finishes Group reportable operating segment. ","This change will provide better visibility into the operations and financial performance of these businesses. The segregation makes sense in that our Latin American Coatings Group sells primarily architectural products in a specific geography, whereas the businesses on our Global Finishes segment service industrial end markets worldwide. Information about the composition of each of our reportable operating segments is included in the 8-K filed this morning. ","For comparison purposes, the 8-K filing also includes updated results for each calendar quarter of 2011, as well as full year results for these new segments for 2010 and 2009. All this information can be accessed through our company website under the Investor Relations\/SEC filings tab. ","I'll now turn the call over to Bob Wells to review our fourth quarter and full year results, then I'll be back to comment on our performance in 2011, as well as give our outlook for 2012. Bob?","Robert J. Wells","Thanks, Chris. In order to allow more time for questions, we've provided balance sheet items and other statistical data on our website at sherwin.com, under Investor Relations 2010 Year-end Press Release. Summarizing overall company performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2011, consolidated sales for the fourth quarter increased 9.2% to $2.07 billion due primarily to selling price increases, acquisitions and higher paint sales volume. For the full year, sales increased 12.7% to $8.77 billion. Sales from acquisitions increased consolidated net sales 0.7% in the quarter and 4.5% for the year.","Currency translation rate changes decreased consolidated net sales 1.2% in the quarter and increased sales 0.7% for the year. Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter decreased to 42.8% of sales from 44.6% in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the year, gross margin decreased to 42.7% of sales from 44.8% last year. The decrease in gross margins for the quarter and year was primarily due to higher year-over-year raw material costs.","Selling, general, administrative expense in dollars increased $33.6 million in the fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter last year, but decreased as a percent of sales to 36.4% from 38% in the same quarter last year. ","For the full year 2011, SG&A expense increased $232.7 million but also decreased as a percent of sales to 33.8% from 35.1% in 2010. Incremental SG&A from acquisitions and new stores accounted for the majority of the SG&A increases in the year.","Our fourth quarter 2011 asset impairment charge of $5.5 million compared to a fourth quarter asset impairment charge last year of $4.5 million. Interest expense for the quarter decreased $11.8 million to $9.6 million. For the year, interest expense was $42.5 million compared with $70.6 million in 2010. ","And as a reminder, fourth quarter and full year 2010 interest expense included costs associated with the repurchase of long-term debt. The incremental interest expense related to the repurchase of this debt reduced 2010 diluted net income per common share by approximately $0.04 in the fourth quarter and $0.12 for the full year.","Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2011 increased to 88.8% from 29.7% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our fourth quarter '11 income tax expense includes a onetime after-tax charge of approximately $75 million to satisfy our settlement with the IRS. For the year, our effective tax rate was 40.4% compared to 31.8% in 2010.","Consolidated net income for the quarter decreased by $58.4 million to $14.5 million. For the year, net income decreased $20.6 million to $441.9 million. Net income as a percent of sales decreased to 70 basis points from 3.8% in the fourth quarter last year. This decrease was due entirely to the IRS settlement. For the year, net income as a percent of sales decreased to 5% from 5.9% in 2010 for largely the same reason.","Diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter 2011 decreased to $0.14 per share from $0.67 per share in the fourth quarter 2010. For the year, diluted net income per common share decreased to $4.14 from $4.21 per share in 2010. The IRS settlement reduced diluted net income per common share in the quarter by $0.71 per share and in the full year by $0.70 per share. ","Now I'd like to review our performance by segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter 2010 increased 13.5% to $1.13 billion. For the year, net sales increased 9.1% to $4.78 billion. Sales increased in the quarter and year resulted primarily from selling price increases and gradually improving architectural paint sales volumes across most customer segments.","Comparable store sales increased 12.7% in the quarter and 8.3% in the year. Regionally, in the fourth quarter, our Eastern division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division and Southwestern division. Sales by all 4 Paint Stores division increased by double-digit percentages in the fourth quarter.","Segment operating profit for the Paint Stores Group decreased 1% to $133.7 million from $134.8 million in the fourth quarter last year due primarily to higher raw material costs, increased SG&A expense and the impairment charge. For the full year, Paint Stores Group operating profit increased 4.2% to $645.7 million due primarily to higher selling prices and volume growth that more than offset higher raw material costs and SG&A expenses.","Segment operating profit margin for the fourth quarter decreased to 11.8% from 13.5% last year. Profit margin for the full year 2011 decreased to 13.5% from 14.1% in 2010.","Turning now to Consumer Group. Fourth quarter external net sales decreased 1.1% to $252.1 million from $255 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, Consumer Group sales decreased 1.8% to $1.27 billion from $1.3 billion in 2010. Consumer Group sales in the quarter and the year were adversely impacted by the loss of a portion of a paint program with a large retail customer that was partially offset by selling price increases. ","Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter increased to $30.2 million from $26.1 million last year, primarily due to the selling price increases and good expense control that were partially offset by higher raw material costs. For the year, segment operating profit decreased to $173.7 million from $204 million in 2010. The segment profit decline in the year resulted primarily from higher raw material costs that were only partially offset by higher selling prices and good expense control. ","As a percent of net sales, Consumer Group's operating profit in the fourth quarter increased to 12% from 10.2% last year. For the year, operating margin decreased to 13.6% from 15.7% in 2010. ","For our Global Finishes Group, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 8.1% to $463.3 million due primarily to selling price increases, acquisitions and higher sales volume. For the year, Global Finishes Group sales increased 32.5% to $1.88 billion due again to acquisitions, selling price increases, higher sales volume and favorable currency translation.","Acquisitions increased the group's sales in U.S. dollars by 3.2% in the quarter and 20.7% in the year. Currency translation of rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 1.7% in the quarter, and increased sales by 1.4% in the year. Global Finishes Group segment operating profit in the fourth quarter increased to $13 million from $9.3 million last year. ","For the year, segment operating profit increased to $90.3 million from $64.7 million last year. In the quarter and year, higher selling prices, volume growth and good expense control more than offset raw material cost inflation and dilution from acquisition. Currency translation had no significant effect on segment profit in the quarter and increased profit $4.5 million in the year. Acquisitions reduced profit for the segment $2.8 million in the quarter and $6.4 million in the year. As a percent of net sales, Global Finishes Group operating profit was 2.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 2.1% last year and 4.8% for the year compared to 4.6% in 2010.","For our Latin America Coatings Group, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 4% to $20.1 million due primarily to higher sales volume and selling price increases, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. For the year, sales increased 22.7% to $828.5 million due primarily to acquisition, selling price increases, higher sales volume and favorable currency translation. Acquisitions had no material impact on segment sales for the quarter, but increased sales in U.S. dollars by 8.7% in the year. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 6.4% in the quarter and increased sales by 3% in the year.","Stated in U.S. dollars, Latin America Coatings Group segment profit in the quarter increased 34.6% to $26.4 million. For the year, segment profit increased 27.9% to $75.4 million. In both the quarter and year, segment profit improvement resulted primarily from higher sales volume and price increases, partially offset by raw material cost inflation.","Currency translation decreased segment profit $1.9 million in the quarter and increased profit $1.9 million in the year. Acquisitions had no impact on profit in the quarter, but increased segment profit $1.1 million over the 12 months. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 12% in the fourth quarter compared to 9.3% last year and 9.1% for the year compared to 8.7% in 2010.","Let me conclude by commenting briefly on our balance sheet items. You'll find more balance sheet information on our website under sherwin.com, Investor Relations Press Releases. Our total debt on December 31, 2011, was $993.4 million including short-term borrowings of $346.3 million. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $32.7 million compared to $58.6 million at the end of 2010. Total borrowings to capitalization were 39.6% at year end compared to 39.4% at the end of 2010. Long-term debt capitalization were 25.8% compared to 24.7% on December 31, 2010. ","For the full year 2011, we spent $154 million on capital expenditures. Depreciation expense was $151 million and amortization expense was $30 million. For the full year 2012, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. Appreciation will be about $150 million, and amortization will be about $30 million. ","I'll conclude with a review -- 2 brief comments on the status of our litigation. In California, the Santa Clara case involving 8 cities and counties in California and 5 former lead pigment manufacturers continues to move through the discovery phase. Discovery will continue for the next 4 to 6 months, at which time the parties will have the opportunity to file depositive --  depositive pretrial motion. The court has set a tentative trial date of September 10, 2012. ","In Wisconsin, the Gibson case involving a single plaintiff was recently argued before the Seventh Circuit Federal Court of Appeals. The trial judge found that risk contribution rule established by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in earlier in the Thomas case to be unconstitutional. The plaintiff appealed, and we expect a decision within the next 30 to 60 days. ","That concludes my review of our results for fourth quarter and full year 2011. So I'll turn the call back over to Chris who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2012. Chris?","Christopher M. Connor","Thanks, Bob. We began 2011 with a cautious sense of optimism, and on our year-end call last year, we predicted that we'd look back probably on 2010 as a transition year for our company, the domestic paint coatings industry. We described the outlook at that time for many of our end markets as stable to improving. And as you recall, we tempered this outlook by saying that raw material cost inflation was likely to remain a challenge. ","I think it's fair to say looking back, the conditions we faced over the past year in both of these fronts were more challenging than we anticipated. U.S. market demand for paint and coatings continued to trend downward, following the exploration of the 2010 home buyer tax credit stimulus. Department of Commerce buying estimates for the architectural market in the first half of 2011 were down 8% from 2010. Most Latin American markets fared better than the U.S, but European markets likely fared worse. I don't think I need to belabor the point too much on raw materials. ","Our outlook at the beginning of 2011 was for industry-wide market basket of inflation in the high single to low double-digit range for the year, and the actual inflation rate, as we all know, was probably double that. Yet, against the challenging backdrop of depressed market demand and unprecedented raw material cost inflation, Sherwin finished 2011 with record sales and record earnings per share. ","We continue to invest in new stores and branches, and we made great progress towards integrating the 4 acquisitions completed over the past 2 years. We generated strong net operating cash that was reinvested in the business, used to buy back our stock and pay a record dividend. ","By most measures, 2011 was a successful year. But I'd like to comment briefly on the progress we made in a few specific areas because I think they best underscore the strength and focus of our organization. First, our ongoing commitment to expanding our store base and maintaining appropriate service levels on our stores despite the difficult market conditions is clearly paying off. Paint Stores Group achieved positive gallon volume growth for the full year 2011, and the rate of growth accelerated significantly in the second half and even more so in the fourth quarter. This growth was broad based with nearly every customer segment showing positive volume. More importantly, in a flat to down market, we are confident that our volume growth during the year translates to market share growth. ","In 2011, our Paint Stores Group added 60 net new stores, bringing our store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean to 3,450 locations compared to 3,390 a year ago. Our plan for 2012, again, calls for net new store openings in the range of 50 to 60 locations."," ","Looking beyond the Paint Stores Group, our company achieved a noteworthy milestone in the fourth quarter, as we surpassed 4,000 total company operated stores and branches across all operating segments worldwide. The same competitive advantages control distribution brings to our Paint Stores Group namely direct customer interaction, responsiveness and the control over brands, pricing, inventory and growth are equally applicable to our Global Finishes and Latin American Coatings Group. For these regions, control distribution will continue to play an important and expanding role in these segments going forward. ","Second, I'd like to take a moment to comment on our continued progress in working capital management and cash performance. At year end, our working capital ratio had dropped to 10.9% of sales compared to 11.9% at the end of 2010, convincing evidence that the integration of the acquisitions completed in the past 2 years is on track. ","This tight working capital management contributed to higher cash generation. For the year, we generated $736 million net operating cash or about 8.4% of sales. If we add back the cash settlement paid to the IRS during the year, cash from operations for the year rose above 9% of net sales. ","Free cash flow, operating cash minus CapEx and dividends, finished the year at $428 million. In the fourth quarter, we acquired just under 0.5 million shares of the company stock for treasury, bringing our full year total to 4.7 million shares purchased at an average cost of $78.16 per share, our total investment of $367 million. ","At year end, we have remaining authorization to acquire another 21 million shares of the company stock. Over the past year, we've returned more than $153 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends. 2011 marked our 33rd consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a string we intend to continue in 2012.","The third and final area I'd like to touch on is our earnings per share performance for the year. $4.84 before the IRS settlement is a record for our company and a solid performance considering the stiff headwinds we faced in the market. If you believe the old expression that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, emerging from 2011 a much stronger company than we were a year ago. And while we still have work to do in offsetting the raw material inflation we incurred this past year through a combination of productivity and price implementation, I believe that 15% earnings per share growth in this environment proves the resilience of the business model.","Looking ahead to this year, there appears to be a growing sentiment in the market predicting better times ahead. Many see early signs of the housing recession that's finally nearing an end, while others forecast moderating rates of raw material inflation. From a demand side, we too see early but encouraging signs of improvement in the residential markets. Time will tell whether this momentum is durable and whether it will ultimately lead the U.S. housing market back to more sustainable levels in the coming years. ","On the raw material front, however, we still expect significant cost headwinds in 2012, primarily from titanium dioxide. Couple this with the annualization of inflation from 2011, and we would expect the average year-over-year raw material cost increases for the paint and coatings industry to be in the high single to low double-digit percentage range in 2012. ","With these factors in mind, our outlook for the first quarter of 2012 is for consolidated net sales to increase 9% to 14% compared to last year's first quarter. With sales of that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.74 per share compared to $0.63 per share earned in the first quarter of 2011. ","For the full year, we expect net sales will increase by a high single digits to low-teens percentage versus 2011. And with annual sales of that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2012 will be in the range of $5.37 to $5.67 per share.","Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question's coming from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Chris, just wanted to know what your assumption was for the U.S. architectural market behind your guidance range for next year and of course, the DOC getting away with it with their reporting. But you're talking about an 8% decline in the first half of '11, what's your assessment for full year and again, what's sort of your base case for calendar 2012?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Don, I think in terms of our expectations for the year going forward for the industry, if we build it up from the pieces parts. We would expect that the housing market is going to continue to show a moderate gain. We think all in on both single-family and multifamily this year, we're going to end somewhere in the mid-to-upper 600,000 units. We think that's going to potentially grow to the low to mid-700,000 units. That will be a little bit of a lift, and we think that the repaint market has also been improving moderately. So all in, I think our kind of expectation for the industry will be that we'll see flat to low single-digit volume gains for the architectural market.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then a question on your new segment reporting, the old Global Finishes Group with so many acquisitions you were thinking of margin improvement from sort of the 6% range to maybe 11%, 12% by 2014. How does that change as you strip Latin America out, and what do you see is the margin potential for Latin America, which I guess is running around 9% now?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, why don't I ask Sean Hennessy, our CFO, to jump in with that, Don.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, Don, again we used to talk about the 12% when we talked about the Global Group. We still believe that both pieces will still be shooting at that 12%. I think that you can see Latin America Group is over 9%, which means that they're a little closer. We expect them to reach that 12% prior to the Global Group. But as we continue to do more things in Latin America with controlled distribution and so forth, after we hit 12%, we'll probably reevaluate that.","Operator","Our next question's coming from Chris Nocella of Barclays Capital.","Christopher J. Nocella - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Your same stores growth is 12.7% in the quarter, what's the split there between price and volume?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, pricing for the stores group, Chris, was in the upper single-digit range. So that's the majority of it, however, we would note that the volume performance in the quarter really was strengthening for that business.","Christopher J. Nocella - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And based on the already announced price increases, do you think you'll still have the greatest benefit in the fourth quarter, or could be -- first quarter be actually a little bit higher?","Christopher M. Connor","In terms of pricing or...","Christopher J. Nocella - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. Yes, for the pricing, do you think the flow-through will be higher in the first quarter than it was in the fourth?","Sean P. Hennessy","For the store group?","Christopher J. Nocella - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Correct.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, yes. In the fourth quarter, which has the second smallest EPS when you look at the absolute dollars, the adjustments that go through there, we had the impairment of some trade names and so forth that -- but, if you took a look at some of the inventory adjustments that go through in the fourth quarter, the flow-through is acceptable. But when you take a look at the fourth quarter, we should -- first quarter, we should not have that, those headwinds.","Christopher J. Nocella - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, on the Latin America business, organic sales growth was about 11% 2011. What is your expectation for that business in 2012?","Christopher M. Connor","In the business, we'll continue to tuck along pretty well. We're going to have some FX issues in Latin America next year with the REI [ph], so I don't know if we've given guidance yet per se in the pieces parts, but it'll be a positive year for Latin American Coatings next year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In your Paint Stores Group, you had double-digit sales and flat operating profits, whereas in the Consumer Group you had flat sales and if you adjust for some non-recurring items last year, you had 50% improvement in operating profits. So why is it that in the business where you had all the sales growth, you didn't really have any operating profit growth, whereas the opposite took place in consumer?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, Jeff, this is Sean Hennessy. When you take a look -- if I can remind you the third quarter, and when you looked at the third quarter the Consumer Group was 11.7% versus 17.5% in 2010 third quarter. And at that time, what we've said is if you looked at our -- the way our inventory was coming down, usually we started to reduce our inventory in the third quarter. And when someone asked why was our margin in Consumers down as dramatic, we said that the reverse will happen in the fourth quarter. That was you take some of that inventory off your balance sheet that's debit going through the P&L because we're producing less. That occurred in the third quarter this year versus the fourth quarter in 2010. So as you can see 11.7%, we're at 12% in the fourth quarter, and the 17.5% was 10.2% in 2010. So that's how -- a lot of different things are happening in the quarter-by-quarter that sometimes the quarters are changing as you manage your inventory and the balance sheet and so forth. So that's why the 2 quarters in the third and the fourth quarter of Consumer were that way. And again, as I mentioned in the Paint Stores Group, with $133 million last year, second smallest quarter, and with the fourth quarter with inventory adjustments, LIFO and others and the trade names, that really would caused the reduction in the flow-through but without it, they showed acceptable flow-through.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just while we're on the subject, what was your gallon inch growth in 2011?","Christopher M. Connor","We said the gallons were positive for the company in 2011. And we said that, that had been trending throughout the year and are more favorable with the fourth quarter being our best gallon quarter.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, there are some -- or possibly there are some properties that are on the market with exposure to the auto repaint and auto OEM markets, is that something that if they were available at attractive prices would be of interest to Sherwin-Williams even though they may be of relatively large size?","Christopher M. Connor","Jeff, we've never commented on a specific M&A opportunity that's out there. I'm familiar with the property you're talking about. I think strategically you've heard us speak to the investment community about our interest in the automotive aftermarket segment but not the automotive OE segment. We'll just leave it at that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from P.J. Juvekar of Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Chris, you mentioned that you gained share in your Paint Stores business, so are you taking share from other independent store chains? And is that more than offsetting any share loss that you may have had to the DIY segment?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, P.J., I think that our comment here is broad based for the industry as opposed to any specific channel segment. Although I think you're right to talk about the smaller, independent paint store operator that struggled in this downturn. I think it's easy to see share gains from there, as well as some of the other regional paint store chain operators that we think we've made progress against. There's not been an offset for our DIY business. We've commented throughout the year last year that our DIY performance was strong. In fact, on all the consolidated numbers that we've given you both on sales revenue and gallon performance for DIY, our numbers were there or slightly higher. So a strong DIY year for the company through our store's organization offset a little bit by the loss of DIY business through our Walmart account. But overall, a pretty strong performance as we've commented. Looking at all the industry data we can get our hands, in order the gallon performance were pretty confident across all segments, there were share gains here.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, can you update us on your efforts to reduce your TiO2 usage in paint? And do you have any volume market expectations?","Christopher M. Connor","We have a number of initiatives underway to address the titanium issue. And we've talked about them in the past with the investment community relative to replacing titanium with either lower-grade sulfite type titaniums, internal formulations to reduce the use of it in sourcing perhaps some emerging technologies from other parts around the world. All of those activities are underway. I think we've given guidance that were those to all come to fruition, we'd be somewhere in the 5% to 10% range of our total titanium tonnage usage that could be replaced. And I'd say we're in the early days of making progress towards that.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just quickly for Sean. Sean, you mentioned you think some FX headwinds from Latin America. And given that industrial production, IP has been slowing down in Brazil lately. Are you seeing any impact on volumes there?","Sean P. Hennessy","Slightly, but not dramatic enough to not give us confidence that we're going to have improvement in Brazil, as well as Latin America.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ivan Marcuse of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question I have is, you've always been sort of conservative on your housing outlook, is there a sign in the market now or something in the market that is more directly related to the repaint business or your store business that maybe is more positive now than it was, than it had been in the past? Or is it just the general market that you're looking at that gives you some optimism going to 2012?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, I think the housing is more positive than it's been on the last 2 to 3 to 4 years. We hit bottom somewhere in the 400,000 to 500,000 units, and we're seeing 600,000 and change starts this year. Most of the economic forecasters that we look at, and we think this makes sense, show a number slightly better than that next year. We see that from permits that have been pulled and projects that are being bid on by our painting contracting customers. So that outlook looks a little bit brighter to us. And we've also just been watching the trend guidance. The residential and the commercial repaint markets, as a reminder, still account for approximately 80% of all the gallon inch that our industry sells. And that tends to kind of start to move and stay on the trend line. And it's been a really -- a good trend line the last couple quarters. And as we said briefly in our comments, the year's off to a good start, really driven by this maintenance painting project. So heading into the year with a fairly optimistic outlook about what we're going to see through that architectural volume through our stores this year.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, Sean, in the Consumer Group, are you -- are operations and the inventory build, is that going to sort of move back to historical operating patterns? Or is it going to be similar to the first half of this year where it was -- a buildup inventory and then as you talked in the second half were sort of a -- you worked out the inventory?","Sean P. Hennessy","Right. I think we're going to go more to the historical. And I think that's why when you look at the improvement that consumer had in the first quarter as they built inventory last year, we'll still build inventory. But I like your description, more of historical. And I think the bell shape curve will be closer to historical. So we probably will not see the changes by quarter that we did this year.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then lastly, what was that FX gain related to? And then, what do you expect your 2012 tax rate to be?","Sean P. Hennessy","I think our tax rate is going to be in the lower 30s like we have been for the past. If you take the change out in the tax rate with leveraging [ph] settlement, we're in the low 30s also. But the FX gain and really the gain in the quarter was really driven in Brazil and Mexico, but the FX plus year-to-date was really Mexico. And then the Venezuela, what happened at the beginning of the year with Venezuela.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Greg Melich of ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to dig a little bit more into SG&A. Now that we cycled a lot of the acquisitions, is that -- that 4% year-over-year growth, I guess it's $25 million, $30 million year-over-year, should we think of that as a normalized run rate now that we've cycled the acquisitions and other things?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, I think that when you take a look at it, 4%, 4.5%, the 4.5% increase in the fourth quarter is more normalized. If you think that we've annualized the major acquisitions in Europe through the first 3 quarters, that's why the full year is probably a little different but I think you're right on with that analysis.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Chris, maybe a bigger picture question. In the past, you've seen over many years your -- the range of the gross margin that the business could do used to be sort of 42% to 45% and then sort of shifted up to 43% to 46%, but you've also been making acquisitions, you've been growing overseas. Do you think that 43% to 46% is still the right range? Or just given the acquisitions, given the business mix that maybe it goes back to 42%, 45% for a few years?","Christopher M. Connor","No, we still feel good about that range, Greg. And I think, of note, we've announced yet another price increase for calendar year 2012. As you know, we give full transparency to The Street regarding the pricing activities taken by our stores group. And we announced an 8% price increase effective February 1 of 2012. So we're going to continue to move pricing into the market place. A great deal of it will depend on what happens with titanium for the rest of the year but if it holds in kind of the range that we have given for the year, for the industry for our basket going up, and we fully expect to be back to in the 43% to 46% range.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","First question is regarding impairment charges, Sean. I'm looking at the P&L and you got trademark impairment charges, which you talk about in the text of the press release, but you're also mentioning asset impairment charges. Are we talking about 2 separate line items or 2 separate types of impairment charges?","Sean P. Hennessy","No, I think we're talking about the same thing. It's really related to trade names. As you know, when we acquired [indiscernible] and the store group, you're looking at MAB, Duron, some others, [indiscernible], some of these trade names we keep for quite a while. But when you -- as you continue to stop using those brand names, you're doing the mark to market on your balance sheet, so you're doing it. Last year those impairments actually went to global and dealt with a long time acquisition from prior years.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Well, the reason I'm asking or focused on this, Sean, is the P&L. The amount for 2011 is bigger than $4.5 million of 2010, yet in the text, it's talking about a $0.03 hit this year versus $0.04 last year. I was wondering if you could reconcile that.","Sean P. Hennessy","That is -- I'll get back to you on that, Chuck, the question on the $0.03 versus the $0.04.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Yes, that's what had me confused there. All right. Got you. Now when we're looking at the new segment reporting, Sean, it's been astounding, at least to me, spread between the operating margin of the Latin America Group versus Global Finishes, and I'm wondering what accounts for that. Is it some allocation things or just the nature of the products? But regarding the latter, you'd think some of these protective coatings would have higher margins than architectural?","Sean P. Hennessy","Chuck, I think it really has to do with the scale of the businesses. We've been in Brazil for many, many years, a lot longer than we have been in China. And some of these acquisitions that we did complete in 2010, as you know, when you take a look at the purchase price versus sales, it was lower than the dollar per dollar that we always -- that we refer to every once in a while. We've continually said those were at lower operating margins. So I think that it's a good change. You're going to see that, but I think that, that's really the reason why.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Okay. Could you be a little -- give us any precision on what the volume growth in the fourth quarter was in paint stores?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think as we -- the earlier question when we talked about the revenue in the 12% range and that the pricing portion of that was in the upper single digit, not the high single-digit, the rest of that is going to be volume. So by mathematics, Chuck, that's going to get you in the mid-single digit range.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Okay, so similar to the third quarter?","Christopher M. Connor","Stronger than the third quarter.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","A little stronger?","Christopher M. Connor","Stronger than the third quarter.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","All right. Now when you look at what your paint stores customers are doing, both the contractors and the DIY, when they're in the store, are you seeing anything that indicates less sensitivity to price increases or a willingness to build the market basket? For example, a contractor finally getting past the hump on buying an incremental piece of equipment or whatever it may be.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think as the volume comes, and we were commenting in the last couple of quarters that has been coming. And don't forget, that volume is building on the backs of essentially fixed price increases announced in the last 20 months. So there's a concern that pricing is having a chilling effect on demand? Once again proving that to be the case is more of the broader market issues that are causing painters to get going again. We'll see the lifts in the associated product sales and really the equipment sales are more of a end of first quarter start of second quarter. And we'll be able to comment a little bit more on that side of it going forward. But in terms of product mix and continuing to move up to better quality products, all those levers which are historically at play here, Chuck, are still behaving as they have historically.","Sean P. Hennessy","Chuck, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to jump in here and answer that question on the $0.03 versus $0.04. The dollars that you quoted which is right from us is what hits the SG&A. Last year, in the $0.04 there was also a $2.1 million impairment that went to cost of goods sold. So that's why it was $0.04 last year and $0.03 this year.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","So $0.04 -- go that by me again, there's a...","Sean P. Hennessy","Included in last year's $0.04, besides the amount that we -- that you quoted is also a $2.1 million that went to cost of goods sold. And so that's what's in the $0.04. We didn't include it in the absolute numbers that you quoted earlier.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","So the $2.1 million is not in that EPS amount, but it is in the $5.49 million.","Sean P. Hennessy","No, no. We're talking about last year's when the number is higher. It also -- the $0.04 included a $2.1 million impairment hit into cost of goods sold. The other number you quoted is the SG&A piece.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob today. First, just a question on the raw material guidance. If I heard you right, I think you said high single to low double-digit raw material cost for 2012. I think on the third quarter call, you might have mentioned that if prices stayed where they were then, you'd be looking at more like low- to mid-teens. And I think we've since gotten a price increase in TiO2. So we're just wondering if something has changed since then, or maybe you're seeing something in the organic side of the bucket or the metal side of the bucket that you're expecting a decline there next year just due to the components of that raw increase.","Christopher M. Connor","Great question, Brian. And that's very intuitive to pick that up, because you're right, there has been a little bit of a change. And I want to ask Bob just to comment on what we're seeing here.","Robert J. Wells","Sure, Brian. The question that we answered on last quarter's call was if you took -- if you straight-lined raw material cost where we finished the quarter, in third quarter, what would it bode for 2012 as it annualizes. It's a little different question asking the same question at the end of fourth quarter because a good portion of the raw material basket eased somewhat during the fourth quarter. So we're starting from a slightly lower base in the fourth quarter. Annualized 2011 cost going through '12 today would amount to mid-to high single-digits for the industry. And then on top of that, we anticipate continued inflation in TiO2 as we indicated.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So was it mostly the resins that gave you some of the release in the fourth quarter?","Robert J. Wells","Yes.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the SG&A, I think it sounded like you're expecting continued kind of 4% to 4.5% growth year-over-year. And contrasting that against your high single to low teens sales growth guidance, that implies a lot of leverage in 2012. Do you think that will be enough to offset any gross margin compression that you might have from a raw material price increases?","Robert J. Wells","All right. I think that when you take a look at it, we really -- we try to give you sales and EPS guidance. I mean, we don't go down each component whether it's gross margin and give guidance especially at this time. But I think when you look at the high point to midpoint and the low point, I think that it bodes that we're going to have operating margin improvement next year.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then I think I heard you mentioned that the Eastern regions led the way on the same-store sales growth in the paint stores. Was that a change from what you've been seeing recently? Or is there anything kind of in the composition of where the same store sales growth is coming geographically that gives you some increased confidence that this housing recovery is meaningful and we're going to -- you'll actually have a recovery in 2012?","Robert J. Wells","This is Bob, Brian. I think the eastern division has kind of been lagging on the new construction side simply because there's not as much you new developments and space to develop in eastern geographic regions. I think the strong performance by Eastern division in the fourth quarter really suggests that the repaint market in the Eastern division were outperforming those in the other divisions. Although as Chris pointed out, all 4 -- or as I pointed out, all 4 divisions had double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. So we're kind of splitting hairs trying to determine difference between the 4.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's pretty broad based then?","Robert J. Wells","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Chris, you mentioned in response to a previous question that you thought you might be able to reduce your titanium dioxide requirement by 5% to 10%, as one of your major global coatings peers has made similar remarks within the last 6 or 8 weeks. Just want to drill down a little bit on that. You mentioned it was early days, can you give us a feel for where you are today relative to that target range? Also, the timing that you would envision to achieve the range and how much you can get from new technologies versus, let's say, just diminishing the content on lower-end products, if that's an option.","Christopher M. Connor","We're not in the range today. We'd be below that. The expectation would be that over the next years, we would work to get in there. And I think that's about the breadth of what we'd be comfortable commenting on. We recognize that given the choice of a poor performing product or a consistent product at a higher price, the vast majority of our customers would opt for the latter. And so any decisions we make to replace titanium, reduce titanium, formulate titanium out go through a very rigorous field testing process. So we're going to lag a little bit perhaps our peers ability to move in this range. Nevertheless, it's work worth doing, and there's opportunities there and I feel that we're on target of where we should be.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then shifting gears, Sean, Brazilian currency and a lot of other currencies for that matter have been quite volatile since Labor Day of last year, can you remind us how you're approaching hedging, especially now that we have the separate Latin segment there. How should we think about your activities or lack thereof?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, I think that we continually look at, again, cash flow. We're doing -- we're borrowing in country. We borrowed in country when we've been to Europe, as well as some of the other acquisitions that we made. And this operating income is being created -- or cash is being created, we continue to pay down. While these companies are bringing cash back to us here in the United States, we're doing some forward contracts and so forth. But we're also doing things between one country and the other, so that we have inter-companies that are protecting us.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. Chris, I think you mentioned in the fourth quarter, you said the volume growth that you saw was across every customer segment. I was just curious if there's a meaningful spread between top and bottom. So any color I guess you could give on which segments are at the extremes. And then if there's any meaningful discrepancy, maybe give us the order of magnitude.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think the trend line there, Dennis, have been that the DIY business and the residential repaint business through our contractor segments were at the high end. That's been consistent with kind of the year's performance. The news in the quarter is that the new residential, and some of the commercial markets which had been lagging turned positive for us as well, and that's a really good sign.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. And then just big picture I guess, in hindsight when you look at the paint store performance for the year being up in dollars and margin pressure being pretty minimal despite the volume challenges that you talked about and the raw material [indiscernible]. Can you give any more confidence about what the recovery could look like or where margins could return to if you do get the volume growth and the return to normal?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, I think when you take a look at one tank [ph], the high points for the Paint Stores Group was 15%, 15.7% operating margin. I don't see anything structurally different. We see that as a possibility in the future.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A lot of my questions have been answered, but just to follow-up, you did discuss the -- or at least directionally the volume performance of the stores group. Assuming kind of similar levels of pricing for the Consumer Group, it looks like your volumes were down significantly and significantly more than would be suggested by the loss of the Walmart business. So anything happened in the Consumer Group in the fourth quarter to give you that result?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well first of all, our selling price -- effective selling price is a little longer. The cycle is a little longer in Consumer Group than it is in stores. So they were not as -- it wasn't as high as it was in the stores. I don't have that number exactly but having said that, I think we were pretty happy the way the fourth quarter came out with Consumer Group.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So 4% to 5% volume loss I guess was at the high end of your expectations, is that what you're saying?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I mean, I think without the Walmarts -- I think in the Walmart, this was the last dramatic quarter we had to go through. And I think that without that, I think it was right where we -- where was our expectations.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","All right, very good. Secondly on talking about margins and kind of the way to think about that for 2012 and beyond. Clearly, if raw material inflation stays as benign, and I don't know if that's the right word to use, but say ass benign as you think it will, which is high single digits, low double-digit type of inflation, given high single-digit pricing that you pass through and the traction that you already got with your existing pricing, it sounds like you should stay on par, or maybe you can get ahead of raw materials a little bit. So the gross margin side of the business looks like you're okay. But what concerns me about your comment about margin improvement and year-over-year after 3 years of decline is that your fastest growth is happening in your Global Group and your Latin American Group, both of which are lower-margin businesses. So is the improvement you're seeking in your North American business is going to be sufficient to offset the negative mix, if you will, from the lower margin businesses growing faster in the external markets, international markets?","Christopher M. Connor","Well first of all, Dmitry, isn't it wonderful to be talking about benign raw material cost increases in the high single, low doubles. I mean, where have we gotten to in this industry? I think you make a very good point about the faster growing segments over the past couple of years. But I think what you should be reading into this guidance that we're giving today is that our stores business is clearly back on track and moving in a really solid direction here with the pricing leverage that we need. We're giving guidance that we expect the gross margins to bottom and turn, in fact to go the right direction. As Sean commented, we expect with that, that the SG&A numbers will continue to go the right direction as well and that the operating leverage for the entire company, this year will be positive.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, very good. And then finally, you talked about the Global Group having the ability to reach 12% operating margin at sometime in the future. It's almost a 10-point improvement that you're looking to gain there. What's going to take you there and, how long is that going to take?","Christopher M. Connor","We have a couple of acquisitions that were significant in this business that were 1.5 to 2 years into the integration of it. We talked last year, I think, on a number of the calls about the need for pricing in those businesses, that we had not been as aggressive as we should have been, given the careful stance we were taking as new owners of this business. I think all of the kind of traditional work that we do here on pricing, on the operating side of the business, on the cost side of the business, on the asset side of the business helps build these businesses in the right direction, and all those things are as quick here. To Sean's point, we have been consistent about giving guidance that these businesses will constructurally get there. There's nothing that's changed our opinion about that. And if scale comes up on these countries, we fully expect to get that accomplished.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Let me see if I can have this a different way. How much of the profit improvement you're looking to get out of the Global Group is going to be improving the profitability of the 2 wood coatings businesses you bought in Europe versus just a maturation of already nice unit margin businesses you have in automotive aftermarket, marine and productive and some other mid shift business that are part of the global group?","Christopher M. Connor","I think we would expect to be getting slightly higher percentage operating lift from those businesses than they would play for their volume. I mean, they're early in their cycle, and they should be ramping up quicker. We gave you some guidance in terms of the size of those business when we acquired them, relative the entire new size of the global group now that you have that data point. But I think what's important to note is that all of the businesses, both the domestic parts of those businesses, as well as the other corners of the world, we all expect those things to improve this year.","Sean P. Hennessy","And I think that in the short term, Chris is absolutely right. But to answer your question a little differently, just because of the size differential between the acquisition versus the core, the absolute dollars will grow faster from the core just because that's 70% of the sales approximately. And so the acquisitions that are 30%, 35%, a little higher than 30% -- our percentage will grow faster, but the absolute dollars will grow faster in the core.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research Company.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","The volume numbers on the stores in the fourth quarter was also something we haven't seen in quite some time. I'm curious, Chris, on the confidence that you have. And I know that visibility is never great in this business, but things you're looking at to give you some confidence on the sustainability or where that goes and what you're assuming what your guidance implies for that in 2012?","Christopher M. Connor","Nick, on that opening comment there -- you made a point that the 2012 was off to a solid start. So we're seeing the kind of gallon numbers that we experienced ramping up in the fourth quarter, continue on that same trend line into the first quarter of this year. Of note, we've just returned from Nashville, Tennessee where we had 7,000 of our employees gathered in one room, all of our store managers and field sales folks, and it's always a terrific time to be with our team. And the sense from their face-to-face contact with their customers would indicate that we're expecting that this industry is going to have a better gallon growth this year.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","And the better is you commented when you went through the details that it's commercial and new resi, is that sort of where the inflection is taking place?","Christopher M. Connor","I think it's across the whole volume. I think that was the question about kind of the range from Dennis, at Delman [ph] about what's the high, what's the low. And we commented that both the res repaint and the DIY gallons continue to move up, and the new commercial and new residential have gone positive. So really across all these kind of breakout segments. There was movement up by hundreds of basis points in the demand for gallon. Not one went more aggressively than other, but we got the negatives positive which was a really a good sign.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Nils Wallin of CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","This year seems to be -- or at least this winter, it's where we're probably running about 7% warmer than last year, have you noticed any seasonality in the order patterns that you're seeing, that you saw assuming in the fourth quarter and you're seeing so far this year in the first quarter?","Christopher M. Connor","The first quarter is always a weather quarter. Fortunately, it's our smallest quarter of the year. So there may be a little bit of that happening. As we've had warmer weather in the upper Midwest and upper Northeast, we've been getting wiped out in Texas and other places. Per the earlier comment, I guess was with our 5 Alaska store managers, they've got 18 feet of snow in Alaska. So I think there's marginal impact on weather, but for the most part it's not that big of deal for us.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. Now I think in your guidance regarding the raw material basket, you spoke mostly about TiO2 going up, but some of the organics or resins getting some relief there. Certainly there's an expectation in some parts of the market about propylene prices moving back up because of the ply [ph] constraints and what have you. Now I know obviously, as in propylene but it translates into downstream resins that you're buying. What are you seeing or what are your expectations in that regard? And are you -- do you expect your resins -- do you expect there could be some resin increases later on in the year?","Sean P. Hennessy","The short answer is yes. I think the rate of increase is likely to moderate compared to last year, but our expectations for the raw material basket for the industry being up high single digits to low teens does incorporate some inflation on the non-pigment side of the raw material basket.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just more of I guess a broader look, your control distribution model in North America is certainly envy of the industry, but then it's probably a little bit different of how you would approach it in South America. Are you looking for the same type of expanse and density of your distribution model in South America? And what type of investment do you think you'll need to make to get there?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, good question. Not every country and every market within the country fits the model, as well as perhaps it does in North America. So just to give you a little more clarity to that, for example, in Brazil within the southern part of the country, around S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio, traditional and very, very strong independent paint dealer network that we sell our products through and want to continue to support those folks. In the northeastern part of the country, not so much and that's really  where we focus our store growth from an architectural neighborhood paint store. Yes, we would need the same kind of density in that geography within the country of Brazil and the economics are very similar to the U.S. economics in terms of what it costs to open a store. We rent these facilities, we put about the same amount of inventory, fixing, et cetera, into them. So I don't think that we need to get to the 3,500 store count density model in the United States for Latin America to start showing the same kind of operating margins. But suffice it to say, there'll be pockets where we can run at that same density. I hope that's helpful, Nils.","Operator","Our next question is coming from John Roberts of Buckingham Research Group.","John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Did you leave all of the automotive refinish in the new global segment?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes.","John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So you're going to keep that, U.S., everything all in that one place?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, those businesses are, on the industrial coating side, global by nature. So there still will be U.S. businesses included in that global business.","John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Right, and Latin America refinish as well.","Christopher M. Connor","Latin America?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes.","Christopher M. Connor","The automotive refinish is in that global group.","John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then secondly, as a leading indicator, sometimes in the past you've talked about spray equipment, ladders, et cetera, have you seen anything in your distribution sales to some of that stuff to give you encouragement as well?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, the volume there is solid. Sales are up double digits in those segments and just as a reminder though, this is kind of the off-season for that when we get back to our first quarter call, we'll really be in the second, then we'll have a better feel for that. But even in an off-season, to be up solid double-digit sales gains on those types of things would be an indication of better confidence for our paint and contractors, John.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jeti Pandya [ph] of Berenberg Bank.","Unknown Analyst","A couple of questions, really quick. You alluded to you are taking market share in a shrinking market. Now thankfully and hope, you are right. The market is sort of starting to turn. Now when it does turn, I mean, what sort of market share do you envisage? I mean, do you expect to grow faster than guys with sort of stores and similar distribution network? And I'm referring to basically TPG [ph] [indiscernible]Valspar, and that's the first question. And then the second question is with regards to TiO2 per se, I mean one of your very big suppliers is putting capacity in, in a more midterm situation, and they were saying that paint companies are trying to talk to them with regards to longer-term contracts. Have you developed or have you had any longer-term contract with regards to securing supply for TiO2 per se simply because they were also alluding to the fact that TiO2 market in the U.S. could become a bit tighter as the year progresses?","Christopher M. Connor","Sure, Jeti [ph]. I'll take the first question on the market share and ask Sean to comment a little bit about our titanium contract structure and how we think about that market. Our expectation on market share is exactly to your point against the other operators of regional paint for a change. And as a reminder, we've shared with The Street frequently the kind of customer mix shift between painting contractors and do-it-yourself. And as we start to see a little healthier economy, i.e. the housing starts increasing, some of the commercial projects increasing, we expect to see a rebound in the role of the painting contractors will play in the total purchases of these products, and that bodes well for us. We have a commanding lead on store count. We're widening that gap on an annual basis. All those things make sense that they should in fact deliver the higher market share for the company and typically that comes against those that are also providing products and services to painting contractors. So that's where we expect to get it. Having said that, the DIY still is a sizable portion of the business in the market. And again from earlier comments, you know that we've been talking about really solid double-digit sales teams in our DIY business for a while. So at least holding our own, if not gaining a little bit of share from a small base to the stores platform on DIY. So all in, we think another solid market share opportunity year for us is coming up. Sean, you want to comment on the titanium for Jeti [ph]?","Sean P. Hennessy","Sure. I would say that in the last few years, this decade's really been one of the most volatile decades in raw material, in all of raw materials. But I would say that the word contract is sometimes overused. I would say no, we don't have contracts per se but probably have more agreements. We will probably and we're always looking to make sure that we can take care of our customers. We'd like to have only one price increase a year. We've gone above that many, many times. So in the -- right now we're watching -- years ago, we wanted to have a contract -- we were -- but we'd never buy a 100%. You'd always want to be somewhat in the spot market. I think the way these raw materials have been rising in the last few years, they've been less optimistic about -- or less wanting to do a contract with us on a firm price. I think that what we're doing as we're watching the market and if we see an opportunity to buy a longer-term contract, we might do it. But I would say it's more in the state of flux right now.","Unknown Analyst","Maybe just a quick follow-up, x TiO2, your raw materials bill, is it fair to assume that it goes up maybe between 0% to 4%, 3%, 4%?","Sean P. Hennessy","I don't know if I'd put it in a range, Jeti [ph]. I think that -- I think it's -- suffice it to say, we do expect inflation on that side of the basket and it's one of the reasons why we give a range for raw materials in general is because rather than pinning it down to a specific inflation percent, we know that, that side of basket will go up.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jeremy Brunelli of Consumer Edge Research.","Jeremy  Ridder  Brunelli - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Just a couple of quick questions. I wanted to validate some of your comments versus what was in the press release. I think you said in the Paint Stores Group that you saw improving volumes across most segments, but it sounds like what you're saying is you saw it across all segments. Should I interpret that, that there were some segments that were kind of a flat growth pace from third quarter to fourth quarter? Is there any read into that?","Christopher M. Connor","I think you for the fourth quarter, it's all segments; for the year, some segments. And when we talked about the new residential piece of that really being the segment that improved, that was the good news in the fourth quarter.","Jeremy  Ridder  Brunelli - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Got you, okay. And I think you said that you saw ramping volumes, does that mean like the pace of growth through the quarter was accelerating in 2012?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes.","Jeremy  Ridder  Brunelli - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay. And then, do you have any sense in the, I guess, in the repaint market if there's been an inflection point between kind of strength and maintenance versus infection more towards bigger [indiscernible] capital improvement?","Christopher M. Connor","We don't have a good feel for that one. We don't give that perspective on a repaint job if it's because of a major remodeling job or commercial capital expenditure to your point. We get great visibility between new constructions and maintenance, but that is a fine line in fact that we don't really get that visibility, Jeremy.","Jeremy  Ridder  Brunelli - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Great. And then one last question, can you just remind us what the lead time is from when, either from a permit or from a housing start to where the pro painters start to buy paint from you guys?","Christopher M. Connor","On average in the residential market that would be about 6 to 8 months lag.","Operator","Our last question is coming from Jeffrey Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do you worry that there's adequate TiO2 supply over a multiyear period if the coatings industry globally grows, I don't know, 3.5%?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, Jeff, that's certainly a topical question for discussion, and you have to go beyond the titanium producers to the ore producers to get your arms wrapped around that. And I think there's been a lot more focus from the paint manufacturing side to do just that. I certainly paid a lot more attention into the various minds and capacity around the world than we would have in past decades as we've been dealing with the titanium for some time. And I think that it kind of depends on who you're talking to and who's trying to push pricing, whose going to indicate what the availability is. We are convinced that the core earth ore required to make titanium is an extremely plentiful ore in the world. We're not worried about a shortage of that at any time in the future. However, the ability to mine it and get it out and have it ready to be converted is of some concern. Just as we commented and the industry has commented on some of the capacity expansions that the producers are generating, we see the same thing coming from the mining side as well. Time will tell over how all that kind of comes together, and if we end up with more shortages than not. We've also talked regarding our ability to maybe offset some of this demand, as well as some of our competitors are perhaps as aggressive, if not more so than we are in that space. So I think it's really early to comment on that. We are quite confident that as we look out to 2012 and short term beyond that, but that the availability of supply will be sufficient to fund the company's growth.","Operator","I'd like to hand the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.","Christopher M. Connor","Thank you, Jackie. Let me conclude this morning's call by asking you to save the date of Wednesday, May 23, 2012, on your calendars.

With us on today's call are John Morikis, President and CEO; Al Mistysyn, CFO; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Bob Wells, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications.","This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com.

All comparisons in my remarks are to the third quarter of 2017, unless otherwise stated. Consolidated sales in the third quarter 2018 increased $224 million or 5% to $4.73 billion. Currency translation rate changes decreased net sales in U.S. dollars by 1.1% in the quarter and revenue reclassification related to the newly adopted ASC 606, which reclassifies certain advertising expenditures previously in SG&A as a reduction of revenue, decreased consolidated net sales approximately 0.8% in the quarter and nine months.","Consolidated gross profit dollars in the third quarter increased $109 million or 5.7% to $2.01 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the third quarter was 42.5% compared to 42.2% in the same period last year.","Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $34.3 million or 2.6% to $1.27 billion in the third quarter and also decreased as a percent of sales to 26.9% from 29%. The revenue reclassification standard decreased consolidated SG&A by approximately $34 million in the quarter.","Interest expense for the quarter was $92.3 million. We also incurred a pre-tax charge related to the California public nuisance litigation of $136.3 million or one-third of the amount of the abatement fund as recalculated by the trial court. I will provide an update on our lead pigment litigation in a moment.","Including the litigation charge, consolidated profit before tax in the third quarter decreased $11.8 million or 2.8% to $416 million. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 14.9%, well below our anticipated rate due to the impact of share-based payments accounting standard, the litigation reserve and purchase accounting expense.","Third quarter effective tax rate on adjusted income was 18.5% and we now expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate on a comparable basis to be in the range of 19% to 20%.","Diluted net income per common share in the third quarter increased 11.7% to $3.72 per share from $3.33 per share. The current quarter includes charges for the California public nuisance litigation and acquisition-related costs of $1.09 and $0.87 per share respectively.","The prior year third quarter includes acquisition-related costs of $1.42 per share. Excluding these charges, adjusted diluted net income per common share increased 19.6% to $5.68 from $4.75. We have summarized the third quarter earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our third quarter 2018 press release.","Let me take a few moments to break down our performance by segment. Sales for The Americas Group in the third quarter increased $126.4 million or 5% to $2.67 billion. Currency translation decreased net sales in U.S. dollars by 1.4 percentage points in the quarter. Comparable store sales in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months increased 5.2% in the quarter.","Sales growth was positive in all divisions in the quarter led by Southeastern division and followed in order by Southwest, Canada, Midwestern and Eastern divisions. Third quarter segment profit increased $52.2 million or 9.9% to $577.7 million. Currency translation decreased segment profit $7.5 million in the quarter. Third quarter segment operating margin was 21.7%, an improvement of 100 basis points over last year's level of 20.7%.","Turning now to the Consumer Brands Group, third quarter external net sales increased $47.2 million or 6.5% to $770.5 million. The revenue reclassification standard reduced net sales by 4.7%. Segment profit for the Consumer Brands Group in the third quarter increased $13.5 million or 19.2% to $83.9 million.","Segment profit for the quarter includes a $26 million charge for purchase accounting expense compared to $54.6 million last year, and approximately $20 million in unanticipated supply chain costs required to keep pace with load-in of a new retail program while also supporting what is traditionally the peak architectural paint sales volume quarter in North America. Reported segment operating margin for the quarter increased to 10.9% from 9.7% last year.","For our Performance Coatings Group, third quarter net sales increased $52.2 million or 4.2% to $1.29 billion. Currency translation rate changes decreased net sales in U.S. dollars by 1.1 percentage points in the quarter. Segment profit for the Performance Coatings Group in the third quarter increased $45.3 million or 75.9% to $104.9 million. Currency translation decreased segment profit $3.3 million in the quarter. Segment profit for the quarter includes a $55.5 million charge for purchase accounting compared to $102 million last year. Reported segment operating margin for the quarter increased to 8.1% from 4.8% last year.","I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. On Monday, October 15, we were informed that the U.S. Supreme Court declined our petition for review. It is important to understand that this decision was not based on the merits of the case and we will continue to press our federal constitutional rights in other lawsuits as we continue to believe the California decision is an aberration.","The next steps in the California case will be for the trial court to appoint a receiver and enter a final judgment for the abatement fund. The court has set the amount of the abatement fund at $409 million. ConAgra and NL are also jointly and severally liable to pay that amount along with Sherwin-Williams. There was a hearing on Monday. We believe the judge will appoint a receiver shortly.","Recently we learned that Lehigh and Montgomery counties in Pennsylvania have filed public nuisance lawsuits against the company and four other defendants. As we understand it, these counties were recruited by contingency fee attorneys, who are actively recruiting other counties. Based upon what we have seen these counties are not receiving complete or accurate information concerning the facts or the law.","On Monday, Sherwin-Williams filed a federal declaratory judgment action in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This action specifically seeks to declare that the counties' contingency fee agreements with outside lawyers violate the due process clause and that the counties' claims violate the First Amendment and due process clause. We are seeking an injunction to stop Pennsylvania counties from bringing cases in violation of our constitutional rights.","That concludes our review of the operating results for the third quarter. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the remainder of 2018. John?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before I comment on our third quarter results, let me briefly address the elephant in the room. You've seen it in the business press over the past month or two, an increasing number of stories suggesting that the peak of this economic expansion may be behind us. And it's not hard to find evidence in the form of economic data to support this thesis.","We pay particularly close attention to the U.S. construction and remodeling markets, which have also shown signs of weakening. But whether or not an economic downturn actually materializes, we'll continue to focus our time and effort on moving with speed to improve aspects of our business that we control rather than worrying about things we don't.","Integrating Sherwin-Williams and Valspar into a leaner, faster-growing, more profitable enterprise, while maintaining our momentum in The Americas Group remain our top priorities and we continue to make solid progress. Our synergy targets for both 2018 and longer term remain on track. And while we still have work to do, each business in our portfolio is growing at or above the rate of their respective markets and implementing the steps necessary to improve profitability.","Despite this progress, third quarter results fell somewhat short of our expectations. Consolidated revenue growth of 6.9%, adjusted for the negative FX impact and revenue reclassification slowed from the pace set in the second quarter, which appears to be symptomatic of the industry. Excluding all acquisition-related costs and purchase accounting, third quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 30 basis points sequentially and 130 basis points from the third quarter a year ago, which illustrates the fact that pricing continues to lag raw material inflation in some parts of the business.","We incurred significant incremental supply chain costs in the quarter to support the load-in of a new customer program while also supporting what is traditionally our peak volume quarter. These unfavorable impacts reduced consolidated gross margin by 40 basis points, but were offset by a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate in the quarter. Adjusted diluted net income per share improved 20% in the quarter compared to last year, a respectable result in this environment. That said, our entire organization understands, we still have work to do.","In The Americas Group, a slower pace of sales growth in some end markets, most notably DIY and a stiffer currency headwind resulted in total segment revenue growth at the lower end of our expected range for the quarter. Once again sales to residential repaint contractors in the U.S. and Canada grew at a double-digit pace. That's 18 of 20 quarters for those keeping track. Sales to property maintenance customers grew at a slightly faster rate in the third quarter compared to the second.","In protective and marine coatings, sales in the U.S. and Canada grew at a high single-digit pace, but this was slower than the double-digit growth we generated in the second quarter. From a product line perspective, exterior paint and stain sales slowed meaningfully compared to second quarter, while interior paint and primer sales grew at a similar pace to last quarter. Sales in Latin America were down low-double digits due entirely to unfavorable currency translation.","TAG segment operating margin expanded 100 basis points compared to the third quarter last year, reflecting our progress in implementing price increases to offset persistent and challenging raw material cost inflation and managing SG&A expense. Both gross margin and SG&A contributed to the improvement in segment operating margin.","During the third quarter we announced an additional price increase in the range of 4% to 6% to our U.S. and Canada customers, which took effect on October 1. The Group opened 21 net new stores in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date net store openings to 43 and our total store count at the end of the quarter to 4,663 in The Americas.","We expect to open approximately 80 to 100 net new stores during the quarter. Sales by our Consumer Brands Group grew 6.5% in the quarter or 11.2% if you adjust for the impact of the new revenue recognition standard.","As Bob mentioned, our global supply chain, which is reported as part of the Consumer Brands segment incurred approximately $20 million in incremental operating costs to support the strong load-in demand during what is typically our peak architectural paint sales quarter. These incremental costs were not included in our earnings outlook for the full year. Excluding the $20 million in incremental supply chain costs and $26 million in purchase accounting expense, Consumer Brands Group adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16.9%. On a comparable basis, operating margin for this segment was 15.4% in the second quarter of this year and 17.3% in the third quarter a year ago.","Before moving on, I want to take a moment and express my deep personal thanks to the many members of our global supply chain team, who supported our effort throughout the summer, often sacrificing evenings, weekends and vacation times with their families. Your dedication is inspiring and a great source of pride to all of us.","In the Performance Coatings Group, third quarter sales, reported operating profit and reporting operating margin all improved compared to the same period a year ago. The pace of sales growth slowed compared to recent quarters as continued strength in our general industrial, packaging and coil divisions were partially offset by softer sales in our automotive refinished businesses, primarily in Latin America and industrial wood business in China and Europe.","Excluding $55.4 million in purchase accounting expense, adjusted operating margin for the Performance Coatings Group was 12.4% in the quarter. On a comparable basis, adjusted segment operating margin was 14% in the second quarter of 2018 and 13% in the third quarter a year ago. We were disappointed by the lack of sequential and year-over-year margin improvement in the quarter. While we have been aggressive in implementing price increases over the past year, raw material inflation has been unrelenting and accelerating.","Over time however, we remain confident in our ability to capture sufficient price to offset inflation. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes transaction and integration costs and the litigation accrual increased 25% to $2.2 billion in the first nine months compared to the same period last year.","Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 16.5% versus 16.1% last year. Net operating cash year-to-date was $1.43 billion compared to $1.26 billion a year ago. Net operating cash in the first nine months last year included a benefit of approximately $88 million from settlement of the Treasury lock hedge.","On September 30, the company had $182 million of cash on hand that will be utilized to reduce debt and fund operations. During the quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.86 per share or $81 million in cash.","The balance sheet reflects total debt of approximately $9.7 billion. We intend to reduce our net debt to EBITDA ratio to approximately 3:1 by the end of 2018. Through nine months, we've reduced debt by $850 million and remain committed to a total of $1 billion in debt repayment by the end of this year.","Our capital expenditures year-to-date totaled $166.2 million, depreciation was $211.5 million and amortization of intangibles was $239 million. For the full year, we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $265 million, which is about 1.5% of anticipated sales.","As we continue to invest in productivity improvements, systems and new stores, depreciation should be between $280 million to $290 million and amortization will be about $320 million.","In January, we committed to open-market purchases of company stock during the year at a level sufficient to offset dilution from options exercises. In the first nine months, we purchased 925,000 shares at an average price of $398.20 per share. On September 30, we had remaining authorization to acquire approximately 10.7 million shares.","Let me turn to our outlook for the remainder of the year. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase a mid-single-digit percentage compared to last year's fourth quarter. For the full year 2018, we expect our consolidated net sales will increase by a high-teens percentage, including incremental Valspar sales of $1.85 billion for the first five months of 2018 compared to the full year of 2017.","Incremental supply chain costs incurred in the third quarter make it unlikely we will reach the higher end of the full year adjusted diluted net income per share range we provided last quarter. We are therefore narrowing our full year 2018 adjusted diluted net income per share which excludes acquisition, litigation and environmental expense provisions to be in the range of $19.05 to $19.20 per share, a 27% increase at the midpoint compared to the $15.07 on a comparable basis last year. We've included a Regulation G table with this morning's press release to reconcile adjusted diluted net income per share to GAAP amounts.","With that I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I see your SG&A expense was lower year-over-year. Is that a new trend for you? And how do you see that going forward?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","No, Jeff. I think, the SG&A expense being down year-over-year is a function of tight management and control of SG&A across all the segments trying to offset the inflationary raw material environment. Also you see the impact of synergies hitting that number, and I would expect the fourth quarter to be down year-over-year as well.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then for my follow-up after you made all of the adjustments to the Consumer Brands Group year-over-year, the extra costs that you bore, the margins were still lower even though the sales were higher. Can you talk about what the dynamic is behind that?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, there's a couple of things. First, as we've talked about as raw material costs had accelerated in the quarter both in the third and in the second, we're chasing it with price. And we'll be out with price again in the coming quarters and in fourth quarter, first quarter to offset those. We also have the impact of the Lowe's program as a reminder that is depressing our margin year-over-year. And if you adjust for the $20 million that we called out in the service costs, the 16.9% operating margin is compared to 17.3%. I think, if you back \u2013 if you neutralized the impact of Lowe's program, we'd probably be flat to up slightly.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. So to what do you attribute the slower sales growth in the stores business? Was it in particular geographies that you saw a slowdown? Or was it weather-related? Or what can you attribute it to? You mentioned lower exterior paints. Was that weather-related?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, Steve. I'd say the most significant factors were DIY sales which slowed from a mid-single-digit to a low single-digit; and our protective and marine business which slowed from a low double-digit pace in the second quarter to a high single-digit pace in the third quarter.","From a product perspective you mentioned our exterior results. Growth rates for our exterior paint and stain were both down significantly on a sequential basis. So we clearly felt the impact of some of the weather and storms.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And within the Lowe's store paint aisle now it's simpler than it used to be. But you still have Valspar Paint on one side and you got Sherwin-Williams paint on the other side.","What's your longer-term strategy there for establishing those two brands within the DIY and to some extent the do-it-for-me channel there? What \u2013 which one is a higher value or a higher-quality product versus the other? Can you elaborate on that?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. I'd say first and foremost we're going to support our customer. And so our customers' decision on placement of our brands and positioning is very important.","To your point it's been much simplified and we don't believe having an HGTV by Sherwin and a Valspar in the store is confusing. We're going to have different qualities at different price points that are easy and simple for sales associates and customers to understand.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I'd add to that, Steve, that the brand perceptions are different. The HGTV HOME appeals to the design audience whereas Valspar has really been a work horse brand covering a pretty broad cross-section of the DIY market.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","And the last thing I would add on to it, you mentioned right at the end of your question, Stephen, about the professional or the pro side. We do feel as though there's a terrific opportunity there particularly with the Valspar brand to attract the handyman and help our customer grow there as well.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Stephen.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, thank you. Can you just talk a little bit more about your price efforts in Performance Coatings? And any end market mix effects that occurred in the quarter?","Just anything you could see to help us figure out how this is evolving in the intermediate to long term would be helpful. Thank you.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, Chris. This is Al. I think, we've been very successful in getting the price through in our Performance Coatings segment. And you saw that in our second quarter operating margin which was flat over year.","What the challenge was in our third quarter was we saw an acceleration of the raw materials and it impacted Performance Coatings more. So we're out with more pricing to recover those margins and we're confident we can get it.","It's just timing and our ability to chase it. As far as mix of the business I think John in his comments highlighted auto refinish in particular Latin America the Industrial Wood Coatings business in China related to the tariffs and coil business. I don't think we're overly concerned with the overall mix. I think, it's just the shorter-term headwinds are going to persist probably through the next quarter or two.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. I think that's a great point Chris. To Al's comments, we're having good success in implementing the pricing and we expect that to continue. The problem has been that the baskets move as we've gotten closer to bending that curve. Teams are committed to doing it. We're committed to doing it. And in fact we've got more pricing already scheduled to roll in. So if the basket continues to move we'll continue to take the appropriate actions.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. And just as a quick follow-up. Regarding the growth in The Americas just to circle back there. There are obviously a lot of puts and takes regarding the U.S. housing market right now. But can you just comment on your own key drivers and what you see right now in the cycle that may differ from previous cycles and just how we can interpret that and how it affects your comps going forward? Thank you.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Chris, how about if I ask Bob to take a look at it from a market perspective, and then I'll break it down into the various segments that we participate in.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. We \u2013 as far as the market is concerned we look at the same data you do. Construction activity has been slow over the last few quarters. We expect that will likely continue into 2019 while remodeling has really driven growth in the industry. There's a lot of speculation now that overall remodeling spend is going to moderate in 2019. And to put it in perspective, I mean, the moderation we're talking about is from a mid-7% growth rate to a mid-6%. So still solid growth.","We are not seeing moderation in our residential repaint results. So it has \u2013 certainly hasn't translated to our volumes yet. Keep in mind also, that paint is a unique category. I know you know that. But it's a unique category amongst building materials because more than 80% of the industry is repaint. And the current strength in residential repaint appears to be driven by both baby boomers who are electing the age in place and millennials who are showing a strong appetite for home improvement.","The last two points I'd add is, first, the deceleration in exterior residential repaint activity in 3Q, we think likely translates to pent-up demand going forward. We'll either see that come out in the fourth quarter or 2019. And also the effect of Hurricanes Florence and Michael on paint demand is still unknown. While they didn't do as much damage as the two storms the year before, there's likely still going to be a significant rebuild and recovery effort.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","And Chris, so when you look at that and how it impacts our business, first, we have terrific confidence given our industry leading positions and really all the contractor segments throughout our company store platforms. So we talk a lot about our residential repaint business. We now have five consecutive years of compounded double-digit growth. If you think about that momentum we've just got great confidence that that continues.","In the new residential side, we've actually increased our exclusive agreements and now have an exclusive relationship with 17 of the top 20 national builders having added one more last quarter. So we've got good momentum there. From a property management standpoint, we have an exclusive relationship with 17 of the top 20 management firms. And when you look at the commercial side, we have a leadership position there by a wide margin. And we're growing there as we further penetrate our color and our product specifications.","And I bring all that up because when you back out our DIY and protective and marine business and when you ask about what's happening in the market if you just look at our contractor business in the third quarter, we grew our sales by around 7% or an incremental $150 million in the third quarter alone. So we're on track this year to grow our contractor business $0.5 billion this year. If you combine that to last year, we've grown our contractor business $1 billion in the last two years. So it gives us a lot of confidence. And wherever the market is going to move we're going to be there.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","You bet.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Just following up on that on the architectural breakdown, really appreciate your thoughts there. You mentioned that as you think about potential shift in the market, as people are thinking about a slowdown, we're looking at the DIY segment in particular. The DIY slowdown through your Paint Stores Group, can you compare and contrast that for us please with the DIY business through the Consumer Brands Group because that has been running a little bit soft for some time now. So are DIY sales through the Paint Stores Group now catching down to what's going on in the Consumer Group? And so what does that tell you the kind of \u2013 the looking \u2013 comparing those two please?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. So I'd say that when you look at the DIYer in the Sherwin stores, I'd say it is a customer who's looking for a specialty store experience. I'd say perhaps what's most important to understand is that if there is a shift in the economy and homeowners become a bit more thrifty, if you will, there will be some customers who aspire to have that experience in a Sherwin store or more specialty store experience and we'll be there to serve them.","If it's a shift towards more of the home center customer, we have robust programs there in Lowe's and Minard's and we're excited to take advantage of those opportunities. And if it's a shift to a hardware store shopper, we have terrific relationships with the likes of Ace. So again it comes back to this unparalleled market coverage that gives us this confidence. Wherever the growth is going to be, we're going to be there. If it's a residential repaint or do-it-yourselfer, if it's a new residential or property management we're playing every point of the game here.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","That last point I'd add Nishu is that I think you'd find historically our DIY business in our stores has been a little volatile. We'll have strong growth quarters followed by a weak quarter. And that's kind of how we read this quarter is. It's just normal volatility.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Got it. Okay, thanks. And the second question on the load-in at Lowe's, the $0.16 I wanted to understand if that's a net figure. Does that just call out the supply chain impact? Or is that netting out the incremental revenue benefit and the profits from that?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes, it just called out the operating impacts \u2013 operating cost impacts. The $0.40 impact that we talked about earlier this year is really unchanged. That'll continue to rollout similar to the schedule we set with the second quarter, and then the rest in our third and fourth. Let me just explain the hit that we took just so we're all clear. I mean we took incremental people service, freight to respond to the customer load-in timing. That pulled forward to our expectations during what is a traditionally really peak demand period.","We need to be responsive as we tend to changing customer needs and schedules. We would have \u2013 we probably would not have incurred these costs as much had the timing been later in the year. And just to be clear it's not exclusive to Lowe's. I mean, we have one supply chain, so we incur these costs throughout the supply chain that really fits the needs of all our customers.","If you look at the fourth quarter, we have a little bit of a hit in there related to continuing to optimize our supply chain and as we get that supply chain optimized, you'll see our operating costs come back to normal \u2013 more normal operating levels.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Nishu.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, everyone, good morning.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Good morning, Ghansham.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, Bob. Can you first off touch on the level of comparative activity in North American paint just given the sequential weakness in the markets? One of your larger peers called out a high single-digit increase for their professional paint stores based in \u2013 store based in North America, you came in at 5%. Do you think you underperformed the market to some extent or is it maybe just a geographic mix differential?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","No, I don't think we're underperforming the market at all, Ghansham. I'd say when you're growing $1 billion over a two-year period, I mentioned the double-digit growth for five consecutive years in our residential repaint and I'd also point out that we're really proud of the investments that we're making in our stores.","We believe we're the only ones with net store increases in the market. So, we're making we believe really good investments in new stores and territories. Over the last three years, we've been averaging 175 reps per year, been introducing new products at the rate of between 20 and 25 new products per year and we're enjoying the benefits of that. And we're continuing to work hard to make our customers more successful. So, I've got great confidence in the momentum we have and more determination to only accelerate it.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. And then just switching over to Consumer Brands. As you sort of think about total system costs with the segment, the inflation you've encountered with raw materials, freight, et cetera in 2018, do you think you'll be able to offset \u2013 basically be able to fully recoup these costs in 2019 for the segment assuming cost basket doesn't change materially on a sequential basis?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes. I think, we have pricing going in as we speak. And yes we expect, assuming that like you said, the basket doesn't move again, we'd able to offset the raw material costs.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks Ghansham.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to go back to I guess the growth in the quarter. In the past I guess you've seen some labor constraints, was that an issue in Q3? Do you think that could linger? And then I guess the reason I'm asking is because you did make a comment that you think there's pent-up demand that could be satisfied. So, how does that affect your comp I guess going forward?","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, Arun, I would say that we typically see labor constraints particularly in the repaint market in the third quarter. It is our customers' busiest quarter. If you look at where the storms affected business, those are predominantly warmer weather markets where they can paint \u2013 do exterior business later in the year. So, whether or not that business is caught up this year is hard to determine. But if it's not, it's not likely due to labor constraints because fourth quarter does not tend to be as constrained from a contractor capacity standpoint.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right. And then just on your comment about the overall kind of macro picture. Obviously, hard to call. But, where do you see gallons kind of ending up this year? And then where do you see that going over the next couple years? I mean, what's kind of the peak you're still looking at? Or is it still in that 820 million to 840 million gallon range? And so that would kind of indicate like a low-single digit market growth going forward. And would that mean that you'd still be able to show growth in the kind of the 1.5 to 2 times that range?","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. Based on our analysis of gallon growth by segment, it is hard to imagine that the U.S. market is growing faster than say 2.5%, 3% at the outside this year, but is more likely in the 2% to 2.5% range. We do believe that we can continue to grow volume at that pace or stronger in the contractor market. As John indicated, in the third quarter our contractor business was up 7%. That has a little bit of price in it but it's much stronger than the 2.5% volume.","In terms of where the market peaks out, we realize that \u2013 we tend to talk about this theoretically, but from a theoretical standpoint if you consider how much the repaint markets have grown over the last couple cycles, we could see an industry gallon number north of 900 million, and would expect to see industry volume above 900 million assuming no significant economic disruption.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. I didn't hear if you guys mentioned the store addition count. It seems like maybe a little below historic levels. Is there any reason to scale back there? Or is it just timing issue to getting those stores up and open this year?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, Robert. We're on track to open between 90 and 100 new stores in the U.S. and Canada. Store openings in the U.S. and Canada year-to-date are actually up over last year's, 54 versus 50 last year. The difference is we've closed 11 stores in Latin America through the first nine months of 2018. So we net out at 43 right now. But we're still on pace, a lot of momentum, a lot of confidence and a lot of excitement behind our initiatives there to continue to invest in stores.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And John, there's some \u2013 one of your competitors, I guess, is under a little bit of pressure lately and there was some comments from the investor that thought there's no synergies between architectural and industrial. I was wondering now that you've had Valspar in the fold for a while if you could talk to maybe what some of those synergies are beyond just what's in an architectural vertical and an industry vertical, but what kind of overlap synergies throughout that portfolio?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. Truthfully, Bob, if they don't recognize those I don't know that I want to share ours. We see them. We're excited about them, but I'm fine with our taking different paths.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got you. Thank you.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Bob.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi, good morning.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Good morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Can you expand on this incremental supply chain cost that you talked about? Is that related to personnel costs or trucking costs? And is that one-time? And the reason I'm asking is you own your own trucks but there are many other industrial and retail companies that are complaining about higher logistical costs with trucking and fuel and all that. So I was just trying to wonder how much of that is one-time, how much of that could stay with us going forward.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, P.J. Clearly, there are incremental freight costs in the market and we see that. But to your point we see it on a less of an effect because majority of our volume is on our own trucks. That being said through the quarter we're running at capacity. And when you throw incremental volume into that mix we end up running almost above capacity and that's both on the manufacturing side and the distribution side.","And my comment about the freight was more related to the supply chain optimization where maybe we had to make a product on the East Coast and ship it to the Midwest or we had to make a product on the West Coast and ship it back because of those dynamics. We basically are pulling out all the stops to make sure our customers are served which means we drove our inventory down a little bit also in the third quarter more than what you would see. But we're going to build inventory back more so than we have in the past in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","So the point Al made earlier about the optimization of the supply chain, the ability then to manufacture those products closer to the customer. As we further integrate in the facilities, we'll offset those. So we don't expect those to continue on.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","That's correct. That will \u2013 it's a one-time event in our mind.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Al, you also mentioned that raw materials accelerated during the quarter. Was there a LIFO impact in the quarter? And can you sort of quantify that? Thank you.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, P.J., I won't quantify it, but on a relative basis the raw material increase is the predominant part of our increase in costs.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, P.J.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just want to clarify something. Are your expectations for sales growth \u2013 same-store sales growth in The Americas Group for the fourth quarter, is your plan the same today as it was three months ago or something changed there?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I would say it's very similar because one of the things that I'll remind you is we had a very strong fourth quarter last year. Our comp store sales were up over 8%. And with the impact of really two price increases in October and November, our total sales were up for Paint Stores over 9.6%. So, yeah, we expect it to be in the mid-single-digit range all year for Paint Stores.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","In October last year Vincent stores was up 11% last year, and we're on top of that this year. So, we're feeling good about the momentum that we have there as well.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, excellent. And just as a follow-up then. I'm just thinking about you had a big tax benefit now in the guidance that seems to be maybe $0.60 to $0.60-plus. So what are the buckets of the other things? I know you have the $0.16 in Lowe's but what are the other issues that are sort of taking that underlying guidance number down?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","You know, let me \u2013 the tax rate just is part of a program. You know, and I talked about this in the second quarter. And we're going to continue to look for opportunities to reduce our tax rate. The reason you take the high range \u2013 high end of the range down is the $0.16 plus we had \u2013 we would have missed our sales number in the third quarter as well that we don't believe we'll be able to make up in the fourth quarter.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Just those two things. Thank you very much.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Vincent.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes, thank you. On raw materials what's your current outlook for the full year? And if we stay at current level particularly in oil prices, what would be your preliminary outlook for raw materials in 2019?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Well Don, the \u2013 as we mentioned the impact in third quarter, the inflation ran higher than we expected coming into the quarter. We put industry average cost for our basket in the third quarter up 7%-plus. So that represents about a 100 basis point to 150 basis point sequential increase from second quarter.","Most of the inflation was driven to your point by rising crude oil and propylene and the continued tight monomer market. So it's not just inputs, it's supply as well. And that disproportionately affected our Performance Coatings business. Titanium dioxide pricing was relatively stable during the quarter.","We \u2013 that alone would put us at or maybe above the top end of our previous range. We initially talked about 4% to 6%, then we kind of zeroed in on the topend of that range at 6%. It's possible we could finish the year above 6%, in the 6-point-something range. But clearly second quarter and third quarter have both been unfavorable surprises to us.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And a follow-up on Paint Stores Group. That 5.2% same-store sales growth year-over-year what was the price volume breakout? And when \u2013 how should we think of this 4% to 6% increase layering in between Q4 and into 2019?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Don, price mix was about 2.5% in the quarter comparable to second quarter. And the second part of your question was on the price increase, Don, so far \u2013 and I know it's been short time here, but we're seeing the price effectiveness similar to what we've seen previously. And we would expect that roll-in to be similar to the past about 75% over that 9-month period.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. It's Matt DeYoe on for Kevin.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Hi Matt.","Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC","So just looking at the LIRA data and trying to reconcile that with existing home sales, is it possible that LIRA remains elevated as contractors work through the backlog that was created due to labor shortages and just something else? And do you expect the trends to sync up with the existing home sales over time?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, good question, because \u2013 and we've been pondering the same question internally. What it appears to us now is that the offset to slower existing home turnover in the remodel market has been stay-in-place remodeling by \u2013 primarily by baby boomers. And baby boomers are significantly outspending all other generations of homeowners \u2013 outspending millennials by a rate of about 32%.","And so, this was \u2013 this is a driver that we didn't anticipate at this stage in the cycle. We thought we'd be seeing higher existing home turnover and that that would be driving remodeling. But the decision to age in place, at least at this point in time by baby boomers and remodel the family home, rather than sell it is what appears to be driving the market.","The good news there is that the millennials who are now coming into homeownership are also showing a real appetite for home improvement. On a per-household basis, they're doing like 42% more projects than the baby boomers. So at this point in time baby boomers are outspending everybody else, but as the millennial homeownership grows that's going to be kind of the second leg to this remodeling market.","Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And I might have missed it, but did you quantify the synergy capture during the quarter for Valspar and kind of where we are cumulatively?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","No. We didn't quantify it Matt. But we're on track to hit the $140 million to $160 million through the P&L that we talked about earlier. If you look at that over a two year period, we had seen the $60 million last year and we're on track for the $150 million midpoint this year. So we're at $210 million, and we still believe we'll come out of this year with a run rate of $320 million. And we're on pace to hit our longer-term targets of $400 million to $415 million. So we have upside there and room to run.","Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right, perfect. Thank you.","John G.

John your line is live, you may proceed with your question. Thank you. We'll move on to our next question which is coming from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one would be around the pricing impact in Performance. Have you seen any issues in terms of share loss because of the pricing that you're putting through? I guess how should we think about that and maybe some of the volume trends that you've been seeing more recently there?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","We have not. We've been working with our customers. We've taken some of that margin compression as part of our strategy to work through the pricing and retain the customers and we've not lost customers.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. And then just one question. With unemployment rates kind of at record lows here and you have a huge number of stores and a lot of people working at them I guess how are you dealing with the inflationary pressures in terms of on the labor side for you? And I guess, how should we be thinking about that going forward if it pushes up or if it's kind of manageable at this point?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I'd say it's manageable. It might be slightly up over previous year, but nothing meaningful. I mean, we're working with our employees and we're really working hard to create the right environment where people want to stay. So we're addressing where we need to, but I don't think it's anything that you need to be concerned with.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","And part of the magic there is that the full-time employee, the manager and assistant manager in our stores are on incentive comp. So they improve their wages by improving their volumes.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Hi, Scott.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks for taking my question. So I know this is maybe a little bit funny question, but I'm trying to see like I'm on your website. It looks like the emerald paint kind of top end is $92.99 to $94.99 on a list price basis. And what I'm trying to actually get is like if I went back when you started the first kind of price increases where that would be. And then next year as you roll through more price increases where does that go? If you could kind of frame it for me?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, Scott. I wouldn't have that information off the top of my head on that particular product. But maybe what I can go is this that our focus on our contractors is really to make them more productive and more profitable. And when you think about the average project costing anywhere from 85% to 90% labor of that total cost, the total cost of raw \u2013 of product is a relatively small percentage. And what we focus on is making them more productive and more profitable. So the cost per gallon, if it allows them overall to be more efficient and profitable on the project is less and less of an issue.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","So I mean \u2013 and I get that. I mean, the paint is really a fraction. Of course, labor costs are up as well. But I guess where I'm going \u2013 I mean, are you seeing any trade down? Is there any \u2013 has there been any indication? Because I think prices are up quite a bit at this stage. I guess, is there any indication of a market \u2013 it doesn't have to \u2013 I was using residential paint as an example of a market that is starting balk and may balk into next year at the heavy increase in prices?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. Scott, if there's a shift, it's a shift up in quality. So you got to remember many of these customers are hiring tradesmen who are maybe less experienced and perhaps slightly less skilled. And so the quality of the product helps them get off the project quicker and more efficiently. So, we are seeing a shift, but it's actually up not down.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Perfect. Thanks, guys. That was my question.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Thanks, again. You usually have a pipeline of smaller acquisition targets that you stay in touch with. Are the smaller firms recovering yet so that maybe the bid\/ask expectations are closing? Or are these smaller firms lagging so they're still not ready to sell until their earnings start recovering?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, I'd say it's a mixed bag, John. I mean, you find \u2013 much of that has to do with geographic, with the segments that they're in. Some are experiencing raw material pressure and that's having an impact. So, I mean, it's a mixed bag.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then as we get closer to year-end now are you still planning to keep adjusting for acquisition costs indefinitely or do you plan to at some point stop adjusting for acquisition costs?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, John. I think what you'll see is we will have additional acquisition and integration costs through next year. We'll give you an update as we have this year on our year-end call. I wouldn't imagine much after 2019 that we'd be calling it out because I would expect them to decrease significantly.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, guys. Question around the Huarun business. With the little wobble in China how is that business holding together? And with that view you have of China what are the insights you can share with us how you think China is doing internally?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Well, from an architectural Huarun standpoint, let's say well, we don't break those out. But I would say all three of our businesses, if you look at Europe, Asia and Australia are up year-over-year, year-to-date. So I'd say there's an architectural component. There's also a wood component piece. And as we've talked the industrial wood business in China has had some headwinds. The \u2013 we have furniture customers who are feeling the impact or appear to be feeling the impact of the tariffs shipping product back here into the U.S. And some of those customers are actually looking at shifting manufacturing out of China into the region. So the two components of Huarun on the architectural side year-to-date up and the Huarun industrial wood experiencing some pressure as our wood customers are facing tariffs.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then you called out a divergence between exterior and interior paint. I think that's the second time in maybe the last six or seven quarters that we've heard commentary like that. I don't recall that historically. Is there something changing in the business do you think where there's more volatility between interior volumes and exterior volumes that we should think about going forward?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","No. I'd say that at least in our model and the way that we work with our customers, Duffy, we're unlikely to lose one side of our customers' business. If we experience something like that it's typically weather-related. So if our customers are coming in our stores every day, buying product and they see a shift in their end markets, we're very focused on keeping those customers. We're likely to feel that with them.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","And to add to that. I don't mean to be coy, but if you look at the geographic mix in our stores business and where we've seen the strongest growth over the last five years, there's definitely been a shift to the southeast and southwest. Hurricanes don't hit North Dakota. So when you have hurricane effects, it is going to have a larger effect on our business because our business is more heavily skewed toward the south.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, fellows.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Duffy.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your questions.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates","Thanks, guys. I just wanted to impact that weather drag a little more with you, if you can help us think through that progression of interior versus exterior. How big is exterior? Maybe help us understand how \u2013 we know that weather was really tough in September, and particularly in terms of wet conditions and flooding conditions in the parts of the Mid-Atlantic. Maybe help us unpack how much of the growth was impacted by that, and what's the mix impact of margins there.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. Justin, just from a market standpoint, I would tell you that exterior is about one-third of the industry in volume. Interior is about two-thirds. Obviously that mix changes when you get into the second and third quarter, the warm weather months. The mix is heavier toward exterior. Our business would skew more toward exterior than the industry from a margin standpoint.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. Justin, we don't typically talk about margin by product segment and we don't want to start doing that today.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates","Understand.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, it is fair to say that the exterior is a little more profitable than the interior.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","That's fair to say.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates","And in terms of the wood, coil coatings comments in terms of tariffs that may linger, you say, I guess help us think about the potential revenue implications to the Performance Coating segment from that, and how that interplays with the revenue synergy opportunity that you guys see intermediate term in terms of the growth potential of that segment overall.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. I'd say, to compare those it's shorter term. We are working with our customers through that. And to your point about the sales synergy side, we're very excited. That's really starting to ramp up, and that's going to play long-term and be very beneficial to our company and to our shareholders. So, we'll work through this short-term side and we're really, really excited about what we're learning on the sales synergy side.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates","Okay. Thank you. And last question from me is just thinking about what you're seeing on costs across the entire portfolio, not just TAG but everything. Assuming any deceleration not a recession, but a deceleration scenario in growth in the coming years does that dent your confidence in achieving the midpoint or the high end of your intermediate term margin objectives?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Justin, we've talked about \u2013 yeah, volume drives leverage through our organization. And without that volume it would be more difficult to get to the midpoint. But I don't think we're ready to give up on that yet. We have a lot of opportunities, as John talked about on TAG. We have great opportunities within consumers and those customers and Performance Coatings like we just talked about. So we have a lot of opportunities for market share growth as well in the different segments and geographies we play in.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, and I'd say that's what's so unique about our model, Justin. As you reflect back on my earlier comments about, if it's residential repaint or new residential or property management, we have the unique ability to be responsive to the market and be where the business is. Same with the industrial side. So we've got a lot of confidence in our ability to drive it and a lot of determination to do that.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates","Thank you.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Justin.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Thanks, guys. A couple questions. One on the tax rate, Al, what should we be using for the \u2013 a normal tax rate? I know that you're always trying to have it be as low as possible. But is a low 20s number still a good number as we model out the out years?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. I think that's reasonable. I think what the variability you get is based on share-based payments, the timing of those that reduce our effective tax rate. I think we'll have discrete items. I think we'll have consistent opportunities to consolidate foreign legal entities, especially with the larger number that we have with Valspar. And I think, like I said, it's a program I think we'll be able to sustain that low 20%.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Well, but something over 20% like this year sounds like it was extra good. Is that fair?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, this year, that's fair.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then back to the business. It's helpful to have the price\/mix volume equation for The Americas Group. Do we have that for Performance Coatings as well sort of what mix price we're getting versus volume in the top line?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","You know, we typically don't call that out because of the mix \u2013 we have seven different businesses in there and we try to figure out the mix volume. What I would say related to that is our FX was a bigger headwind in the quarter and our pricing was a little bit short of where you would see TAG at.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Got it. And in terms of flowing price in Performance Coatings, I mean that is \u2013 we would expect that to take longer and just generally harder to get. Is that fair? Or any way you could sort of frame how we should expect the flow in the raw materials and over the next few quarters in performance side?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, I'd say it's fair, but I'd also say we've got pricing that's continuing to roll in as well. So the pricing that's rolling in this week was negotiated perhaps months ago. So we've got a steady stream of increases that are coming as well.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. We have talked about there being a six to nine month lag. And as we roll these in, it's sometimes hard to see them, but they are rolling in and they will continue.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Got it. And then, last one, just on the balance sheet, as the cash keeps falling in and you're paying that debt down, I guess, $1 billion a year, where do you want the business to settle before you may actually go back to larger buybacks? Is it 2.5 times leverage, 2 times? Where is the right number right now, especially given the credit markets and rate environment?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I think, I would say in 2019, we're going to get back to our historical capital allocation. We do not need to be at 2.5:1, I would say, especially with how we view the stock as being undervalued. We have talked about opportunistically buying our stock and we will do that.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","So it's getting under 3 times is the key, at this point?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I think if I have a view of getting under 3 times over the next year, I don't have a problem with that.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Got it. Thanks. Good luck, guys.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon, everyone. I got a question about Consumer Brands. Year-to-date the margin is down, but in the quarter it was up despite the load-in costs for Lowe's. Can you talk about that a little bit please?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Chuck, they can \u2013 as we've talked about, the Consumer Brands has \u2013 they will continue to chase price. They saw an incremental increase in third quarter. And the other part of that is our global supply chain, as you called out, the impact that had in our third quarter. I think as we roll out into 2019 as the pricing impacts take effect, we optimize the supply chain, I feel very good about our opportunities in 2019 to grow that operating margin.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","So, you look at what's happened year-to-date where it's down, the third quarter is indicative of where it can go if you add back the Lowe's impact. Is that a good way to think about it?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I think that's a fair way to think about it.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then any \u2013 going to the lead pigment litigation in California, is there any insurance offset you can talk about there?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","We don't talk about insurance coverage, Chuck. It's just \u2013 there's no margin in it for us to discuss insurance coverage publicly.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Got it. All right. Thank you. And good luck for the rest of the year.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Chuck.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. The first nine months of the year you'd provided us adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 billion. And given a lot of the uncertainty out there, can you give us a range for what you think EBITDA will be for the full year to see what the operating, let's say, variability for the fourth quarter will be?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Mike, I think, based on where we called out the tax rate and where the EPS is, I think \u2013 and where the acquisition-related and purchase accounting is, I think, you can kind of get a range based on the 19.05% to 19.20%.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. So just to follow-up quickly on Performance Coatings, year-to-date margin is 9%. Are you happy with those results? And just curious given Valspar had higher margins for that type of business, where you think that could ramp to by 2020?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. I guess, I would look at the adjusted margin after \u2013 if you exclude the purchase accounting we'd be at 12.9%. No, we're not happy with that.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","We're not happy with that.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","And I think what we've talked about we have a lot of confidence of driving that operating margin to where we talked about high teens to low 20s. But it's going to come with the additional pricing that comes in, revenue synergies. And we still have additional opportunities for integration synergies.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great, thank you.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your questions.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Hello, good morning guys. Couple of questions, a lot of them have been answered. But I just want to make sure I understand the comment on the share repurchases. Given where the stock is today and given your 10 million-plus shares under authorization still remaining, can we expect you to be a little bit more aggressive over the next several months with share repurchases?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Here's how I'd frame that. We \u2013 on our call at the end of the year we said we'd offset dilution with share buybacks. We have a better working capital performance. Our CapEx is a little bit lower than where we thought. And so the $1.4 billion net operating cash that were generated through nine months is ahead of where we expect it to be. So, year-to-date we returned $600 million to the shareholders in dividends and buybacks. While being able to pay down the $850 million. We're going to pay off the remaining $150 million to get to $1 billion of debt repayments that we committed to. Any free cash after that is going to go to debt buybacks excluding any M&A.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just touching kind of returning to the unpleasant topic of lead litigation, it sounds like things are getting maybe a little bit less rosy if they were ever rosy.","The Pennsylvania lawsuits whether or not you're successful in stemming the flow, is it possible to have \u2013 you march with these litigations through the states from east to west, is it possible that some of these states will come back and revisit what California has done, and can we open up a whole new Pandora's box here going forward? Just how do we get confidence or at least some sort of peace of mind about what this can do for you two years out, let's say?","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, Dmitry. Let me preface these remarks by saying we can't predict what any jurisdiction is going to do. We can't predict lawsuits that are going to be filed. I will tell you, we've successfully defended public nuisance in seven states.","And in our mind those states have fully litigated that issue. So whether or not they can figure out a way to bring it back, I don't know, but whether or not they want to is the big question.","As a reminder, this California case while it's not turning out in our favor, it's an 18-year-old case. And so any jurisdiction that is considering a lawsuit has to know that they are signing up for a long-term legal battle.","And the question is does the outcome in California make us any more willing to make these cases go away faster? The answer is no. We are going to grind it out and we want \u2013 just want any potential litigant to know that's where they're in for.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, Bob. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, Dmitry.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi there. Wondering you mentioned the volatility that you guys can sometimes see in DIY traffic at European stores or DIY sales at your Paint Stores. Is that occasionally impacted by advertising spend? And can you maybe give us some comments on what your advertising spending rates kind of how those have trended during the course of this paint season?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","They've been consistent spending-wise and I would say that we've not necessarily seen the correlation that you might jump to with the decline or softness if you will. It wasn't a decline but a softer DIY side.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And then I've got to ask this question. You've got a major competitor with an investor suggesting that they should break up. If that happens are there pieces that Sherwin-Williams would be interested in?","John G.

Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, Rosemarie, we took the one-third of the $409 million judgment. So, we only took our share. We took our share, full share.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","But the entire share? I mean, we should not expect that there is more to come in that particular litigation?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","The only thing would change is if judgment changes.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay, thanks. And then looking at synergies potential, after one year of Valspar ownership, do you see more opportunities by consolidating more plans versus what you have done currently? Or are you still in the process of studying it?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. I think like I commented before I think coming out of 2018, we'll be at that run rate synergy of $320 million. And we have more to go to get to the $400 million to $415 million. I would say, we're still studying opportunities across all of our segments and all of our regions. And yeah, I would expect to find more opportunities in those.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, are you equipped to supply your customers if they move their manufacturing operations particularly for wood out of China or coil for that matter?","John G.

Wells","Thanks, Jackie. In order to allow more time for questions, we've provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations First Quarter Press Release. ","Summarizing overall company performance for the first quarter 2012 versus first quarter 2011, consolidated net sales increased 15.1% to $2.14 billion due primarily to higher paint sales volume and selling price increases. The combination of acquisitions and currency translation had little effect on sales in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $112.4 million for the quarter to $909.8 million. Gross margin decreased 40 basis points to 42.6% of sales from 43% in the first quarter last year.","Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $66.6 million over first quarter last year to $557.7 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 35.5% in the quarter this year from 37.2% last year. Interest expense decreased $338,000 compared to first quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $47.6 million or 50% to $142.3 million. ","Our effective tax rate in the first quarter this year was 29.6% compared to 27.9% in the first quarter of 2011. For the full year 2012, we expect our effective tax rate will be in the low 30% range compared to last year's rate of 40.4%. As a reminder, our 2011 income tax expense included a onetime income tax charge of approximately $75 million to satisfy our settlement with the IRS. ","Consolidated net income increased $31.9 million to $100.2 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 4.7% compared to 3.7% in the first quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased to $0.95 per share from $0.63 per share in 2011.","Looking at our results by operating segment. For our Paint Stores Group in first quarter 2012, sales increased 20.9% to $1.12 billion from $929.3 million last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 20.4%. The increase in sales for the segment was due primarily to higher paint sales volumes across all end market segments and higher selling prices. Regionally, in the first quarter, our Midwest division led all divisions, followed by the Eastern division, Southwestern division and Southeastern division. ","Segment profit for the group increased 63.7% to $112.7 million in the quarter, as higher sales volume and selling pricing increases more than offset higher raw material costs and SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 10% from 7.4% in the first quarter last year.","Turning to the Consumer Group. Sales in the first quarter increased 8.6% to $320.4 million as a result of selling price increases and volume increases. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased 34.6% in the quarter to $55.3 million. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 17.3% from 13.9% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to continued tight expense control and price increases that were partially offset by raw material cost increases. ","For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 11% to $483.1 million in the quarter due primarily to higher paint sales volume, selling price increases and acquisitions. In the quarter, acquisitions increased net sales by 3.9%, and unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased sales by 2.3%. First quarter segment profit increased 47.3% to $28.6 million due to higher sales volume and selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs. Currency rate changes and acquisition had no significant impact on segment profits in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 5.9% from 4.5% in the same period last year. ","For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales increased 7.1% to $208.6 million due primarily to selling price increases and higher sales volumes, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 5.6% in the quarter. Stated in US dollars, segment profit in the quarter increased 14.5% to $19.9 million due primarily to higher sales volume and price increases partially offset by raw material cost inflation. Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profits by $1.4 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 9.5% in the quarter compared to 8.9% in the first quarter 2011.","Turning now to the balance sheet. Our total debt on March 31, 2012, was $1.32 billion including total short-term borrowings of $677 million. Total debt on March 31, 2011, was $1.34 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $25.5 million compared to $53.9 million at the end of first quarter 2011. Total borrowings to capitalization were 46.7% at the end of the quarter versus 45.4% at the end of the first quarter last year. Long-term debt to capitalization was 22.8% at the end of the quarter this year compared to 22.4% last year.","In the first quarter 2012, we spent $32.8 million on capital expenditure. Depreciation expense was $37.9 million, and amortization expense was $6.6 million. For the full year this year, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $130 million to $150 million, depreciation will be about $150 million and amortization will be about $30 million. ","I'll conclude this review with a brief comment on the status of our lead litigation. In California, the Santa Clara case involving 8 cities and counties in California and 5 former lead pigment manufacturers, continue to move through the discovery phase. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for May 22, and the court has set a trial date of September 10, 2012. Once discovery is completed, the parties will have the opportunity to file dispositive pretrial motions.","That concludes our review of the results for first quarter 2012, so I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. Chris?","Christopher M. Connor","Thank you, Bob. And good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. The preannouncement we issued on April 9 took some of the suspense out of today's release. Our practice is to update guidance when it becomes apparent that we will exceed the top end of our original EPS range by the greater of 10% or $0.10 per share. Our results in the first quarter easily cleared both of these hurdles. Response to our preannouncement also gave us insight into some of the questions you're likely to have regarding our results for the quarter. And I'm sure you'll have some additional questions, but let me take a few minutes to address the obvious ones, namely, the sustainability of the strong demand we experienced in the quarter, the current trajectory of raw material costs and the success of our recent price increases.","Starting with the demand front. First quarter consolidated volumes net of acquisitions grew at the strongest pace we've seen since the first quarter of 2004. Compared to our performance in the first quarter of last year, demand strengthened in virtually every product category, with every customer segment in every geographic region. While it's difficult to quantify the impact of favorable weather in the United States had on first quarter volumes, we are certain it did have some positive impact. We're equally certain that the strong sales trends in the quarter are an indication that market demand is, in fact, improving. ","Let me offer a couple of data points from our Paint Stores Group that I think support these conclusions. First, exterior paint sales volumes grew at a faster pace than interior, which does suggest an early start to the exterior painting season. However, both exterior and interior grew at double-digit rates in both revenues and gallons. Second, we looked at our sales results by geographic region. As Bob pointed out in his comments, our 2 northern Paint Stores divisions turned into strongest year-over-year sales increases, which would again suggest some weather impact. However, 3 of our 4 divisions grew sales by more than 20%, and the fourth was up in the high teens. The spread from the highest growth rate to the lowest was just over 5 percentage points. ","We think this data confirms that there was likely some weather benefit in our first quarter results with equally convincing evidence that fundamental demand in the market is strengthening. Even with the volume improvement we saw in the quarter, the good news is that the market still has a long way to go to get back to what we consider to be sustainable levels.","Sales volume growth, particularly by our Paint Stores Group, was the overriding reason earnings came in above our initial expectations. Consolidated gross margins in the quarter declined 40 basis points year-over-year, primarily to the annualization of the raw material inflation we experienced in the last 9 months of 2011. Although the price of high-grade chloride titanium dioxide continues to rise, the magnitude of the price increase announcements has diminished in recent quarters and global demand for TiO2 has softened, but it remains to be seen whether these increases will be fully implemented. At this point, however, year-over-year raw material cost inflation appears to be on pace with the high single digit to low teens rate we anticipated for the year, with most of the pressure coming from titanium dioxide.","We continue to make progress in implementing the price increases required to offset these raw material cost headwinds. In the quarter, pricing contributed just over half of the increase in our consolidated sales. As our Paint Stores Group makes further progress in the October and February announcements, the impact to pricing and revenues should increase modestly in the second quarter, again, which should result in sequential gross margin expansion. It appears that the first quarter will be our most challenging quarter from a cost price standpoint. ","Working capital for the company, which is inventories plus receivables minus payables, decreased as a percent of sales to 12.7% from 13.9% in the first quarter last year. The change in working capital accounts and the increase in net income each added approximately $30 million to net operating cash in the quarter. This increase in net operating cash was offset by a payment of $59 million to the IRS to complete our 2011 tax settlement.","During the quarter, we acquired 1.8 million shares of the company stock for treasury at an average cost of $100.44 per share for a total investment of $181 million. By March 31, we had remaining authorization to acquire 19.25 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, up from $0.365 last year, keeping our string of 34 consecutive years of dividend increases intact.","We also continued to invest in our control distribution platform during the quarter. Paint Stores Group added 5 net new stores, bringing our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean to 3,455 stores compared to 3,397 one year ago. Our plan continues to call for Paint Stores Group to add approximately 60 to 65 net new store locations during 2012.","Looking ahead, we remain cautious in our outlook on raw material costs, but are increasingly convinced that the improvement in market demand we've seen over the past few quarters will prove durable. We anticipate that our consolidated net sales in the second quarter will increase 10% to 15% compared to last year's second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $1.92 to $2.07 per share compared to last year's record performance of $1.66 per share. ","For the full year 2012, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2011 by a high single digit to low teens percentage. With the annual sales at that level, we've increased our expectations for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $5.75 to $6.05 per share compared to $4.14 per share earned in 2011.","Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and now the team would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from P.J. Juvekar of Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","SG&A spending was up almost 10% year-over-year. I was wondering if there was any pull forward or promotions or marketing expenses from spring season into 1Q.","Sean P. Hennessy","P.J., this is Sean Hennessy. And we marginally spent a little more SG&A on merchandising and advertisement, but really no pull forward. I think that the advertising plan that we -- had planned in the first quarter we ended up doing. I think the majority of that, when you take a look at that SG&A increases with the sales increase that we had, I think the hours in the stores and start seeing us putting more service hours in the store to make sure that the customer service is maintained. So our SG&A did go down as a percent of sales. It did have an increase as a percentage, you did mention. But when the gallons are going that way, you're going to see us continue to add service in the store to make sure that proper customer service is handled.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And secondly, what are you seeing in the DIY versus the contractor channel? And is the contractor business coming back sustainably in your opinion?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, P.J., both of those segments, as we commented, had strong quarters for the company. Speaking on our Stores business, specifically, the DIY business also enjoyed a double-digit sales, which is consistent with the performance we've been seeing in the DIY side of that now for the last 5 or 6 quarters. The good news in the quarter, and the one that we've been saying should come at some time, was the strength in the contractor segment, again, across all segments. And for us, that will be the new residential painting contractor, the commercial painting contractor, property management, the residential repaint. All of these segments are clicking and generating strong sales and volume gains.","Operator","Our next question's coming from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Chris, with regard to your same-store sales growth of 20.4% in Paint Stores, will you elaborate on how much of that might have been derived from volume versus price in the quarter roughly?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I think we've been commenting, Kevin, that our price impact in the Stores business had been in the high single digits over the last kind of third and fourth quarter of last year. That trend continued into the first quarter of this year. So slightly more than half of that lift for the company in the segment for the quarter was volume.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, given the trends that you're seeing on raw materials, have you taken any very recent price actions since the 8% increase that I believe you were implementing for Feb 1? Or would that be likely in your view?","Christopher M. Connor","Okay. No additional pricing activity has taken place since the February announcement to our stores. As is our practice with the investment community, we don't preannounce any pricing activities. We cover that off with our customers first and then provide great transparency to you. So no comments on that at this time.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Fair enough. And then finally, Chris, on the splits on the exterior architectural coatings versus interior, I think you mentioned that those were up double digits. Would you care to comment on the magnitude of that spread and how that would compare to normal trends with an eye toward disentangling the weather effects?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. It's a little meaningless in the first quarter because, historically, our interior gallons are much, much greater as they should be at that time of the year than exterior gallons. So the percentage improvement, one relative to the other, kind of skews that. I think the point that we'd like to make sure that the investment community understands is that the interior gallons were up double digit, and that really gives us the confidence of the underlying strength in the market. So exterior gallons outpaced that. It was a good quarter for that, but it's the interior numbers that really drove the quarter.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering about your Latin American operations. Do you use chloride-based TiO2 there or sulfate-based TiO2?","Christopher M. Connor","Predominantly chloride.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And is there very much of a price difference between chloride-based TiO2 these days and sulfate-based TiO2 on average?","Christopher M. Connor","Jeff, I don't have any data of -- at my fingertips on the spread. I do know that a spread has opened up between chloride and sulfate. I don't know what that spread is on the spot market.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, are you looking at any large acquisitions this year, or what's the probability that Sherwin-Williams might make a multibillion-dollar acquisition in 2012?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. Jeff, I think inappropriate to prospectively comment on acquisitions. I think the best guidance for you is to look at the historical way the company's approached that. Our track record has been to really find these terrific bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen our control distribution platform in the Americas or add technology to us. And to the extent that we can continue to find those that add shareholder value, we'll do those. I think that's all we have to say on that at this time.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So a big acquisition, the probability would be pretty small?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, just the logic of how many of those targets remain in the industry, so -- I mean, I wouldn't care to comment on that one way or the other.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","First, Chris, I just have to compliment you on knowing the underlying chemical makeup of the TiO2 in Latin America. Impressive. So just one big picture question. You gave great data to understand the breadth of the recovery. I guess just in your professional opinion, kind of the gut reaction, what's the best answer as to why? Why do you think it's so broad-based? And what happened of late that's kind of turned the corner for this for the consumer?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Dennis, we've been commenting for a while about the unsustainable gallon volume numbers for the American professional coatings industry. And as you recall, after a rough start to the year last year with negative volumes, flattening out in the second, slightly up in the third and then trending better in the fourth, I think we commented on the fourth quarter call that that momentum would be continuing to carry through. We were confident there was pent-up demand for normal maintenance and decorating that was needed to be addressed. And I think as -- we just said 4 years is an awful long cycle to go through, that the past cycles would show that this would start to rebound. We expected the contractor share of the end market would rebound back towards the 50% more historic run rate level, and that having gained share in the downturn that we feel in good position to capitalize on it. And all those factors kind of started to come to fruition in the first quarter.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that. And then, the second comment, I imagine you'd normally only dream about double-digit volume growth. So now that you've seen it and you've seen how the cost structure reacts, what would you say, relative to your expectation heading into this year, about your ability to lever volume in which you found in the first quarter relative to that?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I think we feel very good about the leverage that we've had. If you look at the flow-through that Stores had, and I think we've made comments for many, many years that when we give volume, we'd have flow-through and last year [ph], we used to talk about 3%. And once we got past 3%, you'd see it. And then after the downturn that Chris talked about with the volumes in North America and when you take a look at the increases in the flow-through we had in the first quarter, we feel pretty good about the operations and net of gallons continue -- will continue to flow through operating profit.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","So Sean, is it fair to say that what you saw in the expense leverage is what you would have expected for this, given level of volume?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","First question, looking at the 260 basis points of margin improvement in the Paint Stores segment in the quarter, I don't think you got any help with the gross margin line there, so it was all leverage. Sean, what kind of -- what does that tell us about the opportunity for further margin expansion or the cadence thereof over the rest of this year?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. Chuck, as I'm sure you recall, 15.5% operating margins was our peak at Stores Group and that happened in 2007. And as the volume went down -- last year, we were in the 13s. So we take a look at it. We think that -- we always felt that the 15.5% was not a -- not just a onetime event. I think that we thought that eventually we could get back to that point in the way that we structured and the way that we've continued to build out the Stores group, we feel that that's not the ceiling. That we think, eventually, we'll be above that 15.5% operating margin.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","You think you'll hit it this year?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, we don't forecast segments and so forth. So -- but I'll tell you what, first quarter is up 2.6%. We were 13.1% in the year. If we did that every quarter, we'd be at 15.7%. We're not forecasting our -- we're not giving guidance for that though, Chuck.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","I read you, I read you. It was pretty impressive. Am I right though, you had gross profit margin pressure in Paint Stores in the quarter?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. In the Q, when you get a chance, when we submit our Q and a add-on line [ph], you're going to see that the incremental gross margin dollars were up $80 million. That will be what we write and so right there you'll see that that will show you that's where we were.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","All right. When you look across your various paint lines, whether it's DIY or contractor brands or it's Pratt & Lambert or Dutch Boy or Sherwin-Williams, with the price increases that we've seen, what quality levels were your customers buying in the quarter? Maybe there's not a general answer to this, but were they trading up for quality? Were they affected? Is product mix affected by price?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. We've commented on that historically, Chuck, and I think the same trends are in effect here. We continue to enjoy the modest shift mix towards better quality products. Again, if the contractor business has strengthened, they tend to be a high-quality purchaser to reduce their labor costs. So all good news there, nothing new to report.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","All right. And in the rest of the year, you're going to have -- well, I guess more for the second quarter by a 10% price tailwind. With this kind of volume growth, it seems to me your sales expectation is a little conservative. Would that be a fair way to characterize it?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. We've also got some -- we're taking a look at the currency and someone mentioned Latin America Group earlier. Latin America Group had a pretty sizable currency and you look at what's happened in Real, and you look what happens with the Mexican peso and then euro. Last year, the euro was about $1.34. Right now, we're watching the euro. So I think -- we don't do segments, but I think if you look at the segments, that'll probably tell you that of all the segments, we think probably Stores Group is going to lead us again in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Brian Maguire for Bob this morning. Just one other data point on that is something you could provide. Maybe just comment on the inter-quarter trend you saw there and how that -- those volume numbers really trended, particularly at the end of the first quarter when you got into some more normal weather patterns and maybe even into April if you got any data you could share?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I think that the quarter was pretty steady throughout all 3 months, which again, back to your comment, Brian, should give some comment to the underlying market strength as opposed to the particular weather. The best day we had in the quarter was February 29 because leap year goes up against nothing. When you're a retailer, leap year matters. But other than that, it was just really a very solid quarter throughout the entire 3 months.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great, yes. And then looking at the difference between the Consumer growth and the Paint Stores growth, you try and extrapolate the volume growth and Consumer, maybe it was low-single -- low- to mid-single digit volume growth. But it seemed like maybe 1\/2 to -- 1\/3 to 1\/2 of what it was at the Paint Stores. How do you kind of reconcile the big difference in the volume growth between those 2 channels?","Christopher M. Connor","There's a couple of things. We don't -- the reason we always -- when we try to give you a flavor for the comp stores is really for pricing. We don't really release unit volume gallon, just volume throughout the Consumer, because in Consumer you have Thompson there. You have Minwax. You have brushes, rollers, caulk, frame and paint. So unit movement is really tough to see, but there's no doubt that the Stores Group was definitely stronger than in the Consumer. But there was a lot of other moving parts in that Consumer relating to a lot of other product lines.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then -- and just one last question, if I might, on the -- your inventory levels. Have you been doubling inventory? Or -- we've heard from some of the -- 2 producers, that they continue to see de-stocking in their chains. Have you tried to take advantage of some of the softness there to do some pre-buying, or building your inventory levels? I guess you're kind of peaking on your inventory levels now or as you head into the more normal painting season. But any sense of any change versus 1 year ago in the inventory?","Sean P. Hennessy","We always build inventory in the first quarter. If you watch, we do have enough capacity to supply every gallon of paint that we sell in June, July and August. So there's such a sales curve in our business. In the first quarter, we're always going to build inventory. If you look at it, we feel pretty good about where our inventories are. We had more inventory in finished goods last year. But last year, there was a lot of concerns about titanium dioxide shortages or raw material shortages, and that's really what drove it last year. We find that pre-buying or doing different things with different raw materials, the efficiencies of our operation, we're better off -- instead of having more invested, the amount that you're going to pre-buy or pre-produce really doesn't change a great deal so -- versus trying to find locations to bring that inventory in and handle it multiple times. So we feel this quarter was a pretty normal quarter. It went up against last year where we did pre-build some finished goods inventory. But this year's pretty normal, and we feel pretty good at where we're at.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial Group.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A question on -- first on guidance. I know you beat the midpoint of your original first quarter guidance by about $0.30, yet you're only taking up your full year guidance by about $0.38. As we get into the seasonally strong second quarter, shouldn't this emerging volume recovery both in the overall market and contractor sales lead to more earnings leverage?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. Don, I would tell you that typically -- we talked about the sales curve here. The first quarter is our lowest and smallest quarter. So when you put that gallon through, that has a nice effect on us. And I think that typically, I would tell you it's a -- very few times have we changed our full year guidance after the first quarter up or down because sometimes we'll actually say, a good week in June takes care of a month of February -- a bad month of February. But when you sit there and take a look at it, the first -- the full year guidance, there's a lot of different things moving in and out. And you typically, in the first quarter, we'll see what happens in the second and third. Someone had just mentioned to me that the last time we had 20% comp store gains were back in 1994. So to sit there and say that that occurred at the smallest quarter of the year -- will that continue in the larger ones? But it's only happened once in the last 18 years. So to project that out to the next 3 quarters, we don't have that in our guidance.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A question for Chris on your view of the overall market. I think by your numbers, you're showing, what, 612 million gallons of U.S. volumes last year for the industry, which was down slightly. What kind of recovery do you see this year in percentage terms? And do you still think that maybe 700 million-plus is the normalized level for the U.S. market?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Don, we're absolutely convinced that over 700 million gallons is the normalized volume level for the U.S. market. That would indicate that housing starts would be back over 1 million, 1.2 million, 1.3 million perhaps. Existing home turnover numbers would be back to more normalized run rates in the plus or minus 6 million units per year, and then a more normalized maintenance and decorating schedule. So as we come out of this historic downturn in volumes and to your point, negative again last year to 612 million, we think there's a several year ramp-up here of maybe 2x, 3x the GDP growth, which has been the historical growth rate for architectural gallons. And to Sean's point, it's very difficult after one quarter and the lightest quarter of the year to indicate that that's going to be that strong going forward. We do take great comfort in all the anecdotal conversations that we have with thousands and thousands of painting contractors in our stores every day and listen to them talk about the work they have lined up for the year, the fact that they're hiring crews and adding painters to their teams or purchases of the kinds of equipment and materials that they would need for a busy season are ramping up as well. So all these would indicate to us is that 612 million gallon number that the industry saw last year should, in fact, be moving towards the positive direction. And time will tell how long it takes us to get back up over 700 million gallons.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Just wanted to follow through on the raw materials situation. You gave kind of your expectations for the year, which should maintain at high single digit to low teens. If you look at the impact of raw materials had on your quarter, can you talk about both on year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter basis what you saw and what you expect to see in the second quarter?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, Dmitry. Without getting too specific, the first quarter would obviously have the most annualization impact in it from the inflation that we saw in 2011. So with a high single digit to low teens expectation for the year, even if there was very little incremental inflation from Jan 1 to March 31, you would expect that first quarter raw material costs would be at the high end of that range for the year.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","On year-over-year basis?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And versus the fourth quarter, your raw materials kept going up, and I would imagine that the fourth quarter raw materials purchases flowed through your P&L in the first quarter. So was raw material actually a benefit to your margins in the first quarter?","Sean P. Hennessy","No. There was some incremental inflation from 4Q to 1Q sequentially.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Was there a deflation in 4Q versus 3Q of last year, do you remember?","Sean P. Hennessy","No. Each quarter, with the increase of our raw materials, the increases occurred. Second quarter was higher than the first quarter. The third quarter was higher than the second quarter. And the fourth quarter was higher than third quarter.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","So you didn't see the raw materials declining in the fourth quarter like most other petrochemical purchasers have seen?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, we didn't necessarily make that comment with reference to any specific component of the raw material basket, but the basket in total inflated each quarter last year, primarily driven by titanium dioxide.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Okay. And the second question, obviously, double-digit rate of growth may not be sustainable. Certainly, I don't think it's sustainable for the year. But do you think at least high single digits is possible as we get into the second quarter that, in other words, whatever external paint demand was pulled into the first quarter should not -- as you mentioned, it wasn't meaningful enough to impact, assuming weather cooperates, the normal painting season in the second quarter. So you're still looking -- I'm assuming you're still looking for close to double-digit growth in volumes in the second quarter of the year as well.","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, we did forecast sales at 10% to 15%, and I think that that's the consolidated number. And I think that when you take a look at it, Chris mentioned how much was the selling price was for the Stores Group, but I think that you make your thoughts on that.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then final question, given that you probably have more volume leverage, I would assume in your Stores Group than in the Consumer Group, and your Stores Group volumes look like they were stronger year-over-year in terms of growth versus the Consumer Group. What's accounting for the fact that your margins in the Consumer Group expanded so much more than it did in the Paint Store Group?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, I think, number one, they had a nice sales gain, and I think that they've been working on some margin improvement. And I think that if you look at the Stores Group, we were increased on our SG&A. We're feeling that whereas in the Consumer Group, you don't see it. And then [indiscernible] the takes as the Consumer Group is making the paint for the Paint Stores Group. And so when you see that volume increase, you'll see that they do get the benefit of that.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","On the gross margin side, but not necessarily on the -- not necessarily in the operating margin side, right, because you don't have the fixed cost of your stores in the Consumer Group?","Sean P. Hennessy","Right, which is why I'm saying that when the one went from 7.4% to 10%, which was pretty strong, we feel pretty good about it, Consumer actually grew faster than that and that's because of the incremental SG&A that went into Stores.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. And that incremental SG&A, was that just considered a onetime campaigns and setting up posters and new displays? Or is it going be an ongoing...","Sean P. Hennessy","No, it was headcount. I mean, it's ongoing. We did put more hours into the store to satisfy the customer's needs.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","So as long as there's good demand, you expect to continue to pay your guys overtime, which is a high-priced problem to have?","Sean P. Hennessy","Right.","Christopher M. Connor","And not so much overtime. It just -- when we say putting hours in, we're ramping up. We're hiring more people and staffing these stores at a better level, Dmitry.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research Company.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","A question on gross margin. We saw the volume posit that held forward [ph] in the first quarter. In terms of the gross margin recovery, I think you've talked about 43% to 46%. I'm just interested if that's still the range you're targeting and how you think the pace of recovery plays out back towards that as we move forward. Not necessarily talking about the second quarter, but over the, call it, medium term.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I think that the long term, we still believe the 43% to 46% number is a good number, Eric. And in the meantime, in the short term, I think that -- or midterm, whatever you want to call it, we think that -- we talked about the first quarter really being the toughest when it comes to this raw material annualization. We think that we're probably going to start seeing some better comparisons to last year. Last year, we came in at 42.7% for the year. So on a quarter-by-quarter basis, I think you're going to see better comparisons, and I think you'll see the first one in the second quarter.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Great. And then secondly, on the SG&A and -- on the SG&A -- rate of SG&A growth, and I understand in 1Q, there were a few moving parts, but can you talk about a little bit about the discipline of how SG&A should grow relative to either sales dollar growth or volume growth? I know you talked a little a bit about that last quarter, but can you just sort of refine how we should be thinking about that?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I think that -- and this is where you get into -- we -- we're always looking to get improvement in the operational efficiencies. So we look at our gallons per full time equivalent. We also look at sales per full time equivalent. Some of those have been tougher to watch, Eric, because of the selling prices have gone over the last 2 to 3 years. You can imagine it was easier to get sales per full time equivalent increase than it was gallon per full time equivalent. So it's hard to give you a metric that I would tell you, \"Here's how you should build your models, and here's why.\" When you take a look at where we are, a lot of times on the plant side, we know pretty well where we're going to be in total capacity and where we are in capacity utilization because around the country, you might have stores that are in different spots of the utilization. So as those gallons grow in certain parts -- and you can imagine, we're very tight when it comes to the fourth quarter and first quarter on overtime and part-time hours. And when the demand came and there was demand everywhere, you saw SG&A and hours growing at -- in the Midwest division and Eastern division. So I think that probably the best venture I can tell you, if we have those kinds of gallon gains for the short period, you're going to see our SG&A grow in the 6% to 8% to 9%. When that starts coming down, then I think you'll see that go down.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Nils Wallin of CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","First off, I guess, is there a way either quantitatively or qualitatively to break out the type of demand you saw? How much of that you thought was pent-up demand? How much of it was the normal type of growth you would see from maintenance and property management?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. That's a good question, Nils. I don't know that we have much more data to offer you than kind of the historic growth of the industry. We long believe that architectural paint volumes move pretty much in lockstep with GDP growth. So to the extent that the market's growing -- the broader economic market is growing in a 1% to 2%, gallons should move at that pace. Sherwin has long believed that we can gain share in any cycle and that we would grow at 2x that. And then you put our kind of strong gallon performance for the quarter and figure out that some of that is rebound and pent-up demand and some of it is outperforming our competitors. Not quite sure that I can offer much more than that.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. It looks like you've built out more stores -- or extended more stores in the Southwestern division kind of year-over-year or at least 2011 versus 2010. And I'm wondering, is that a conscious decision because some of those areas were the most hurt during the downturn, so you figured those will be the ones that will rebound the quickest? Or is it lack of representation or share gains?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. We take the long-term view on the right markets to be putting our stores in. I think we've shared with the investment community a density map that shows that the western part of the United States is where our household penetration is at its lowest levels. Last year's numbers reflect a little bit more of a focus in California real estate development and strong store count adds in that market drove that number.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Aram Rubinson of Nomura Securities.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Two things. One is would you mind giving us a little bit more color on that gross profit dollar that you gave us for the Paint Stores Group for the other divisions, if you don't mind?","Sean P. Hennessy","Sure. What's going to happen is -- and just give me a few seconds here. Stores group was $80 million and the incremental gross margin dollars, I think, was $60 million. And the Global Finishes Group, I think, it's right around $10 million. And then you have over in the Latin America group, $16 million -- oh, I'm sorry, I said that wrong. $3 million.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, so $80 million, $60 million, $10 million and $3 million?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Two other quick ones, just to follow up. I appreciate that opening stores is a difficult task, both between situating them and also having human capital to open them professionally. There are companies like Dollar General that are opening 650 stores while you guys are opening 60. So in other words, it's probably possible to open more effectively. I'm wondering when you'll step on the gas and what you'd still need to see and what -- how high is up maybe on that metric for you?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, our hats off to Dollar General. 2 stores a day for a year, that's a hell of a pace. We've run as hard, Bob [ph], as 100 to 120 at our peak. And I think that we've commented in the last couple of years that with the significant downturn in the market, we've kind of considered ourselves at idle speed at this 50 to 60 store pace. Our expectations are that that number will begin to ramp up. We expect to do more this year than last year. And I think that we're going to continue to do more going forward.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then the final question, if you don't mind, is just a comment on the administrative segment. It looks like a very high number, $74 million. I think that was the -- maybe there was one other quarter that was that high in the past 10 quarters. What should we think in terms of modeling for that since it's a little bit less of kind of a straight line? How can we think about number for the year?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I think when you take a look at that $74 million, we were up $22 million, so we're up over 40%. Last year at around $243 million for the year. I don't think we're going to grow at 40%, but I could see that growing at 10% to 15% for the year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Yes, Sean, just as a follow-up. I was looking at the others items in your P&L. The foreign currency gain was a nice swing in your favor. Was that cash, or is it just a function of booking assets held outside the U.S.?","Christopher M. Connor","It was the latter, Chuck, and it was really just an intercompany asset between us and Mexico with the Mexican changes there. So that's where -- you're right, the $5 million versus last year's $1.3 million. But there was the pounds from Great Britain and the Mexican peso with the assets on the balance sheet.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Mr. Bob Wells for any closing remarks.","Robert J. Wells","Thanks, Jackie.

After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions.","I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.","Jim Jaye","Thanks Jessie and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. All comparisons in my remarks are to the second quarter of fiscal 2018, unless otherwise stated.","Consolidated sales in the second quarter of 2019 increased $104.1 million or 2.2% to $4.88 billion. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales by 1.5%. Consolidated gross profit dollars in the quarter increased $142.8 million or 7% to $2.18 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the second quarter increased to 44.7% from 42.7% in the same period last year. Excluding impacts from purchase accounting, adjusted consolidated gross margin in the quarter increased to 44.9% from 43.1%.","Selling, general and administrative expense increased $23.4 million or 1.8% to $1.33 billion in the second quarter but decreased slightly as a percent of sales to 27.3% from 27.4% in the same quarter last year. Interest expense for the quarter declined $4.3 million to $89.2 million. Consolidated profit before tax in the second quarter increased $137.6 million or 25.6% to $675.7 million. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 30.3%, which includes the previously disclosed tax credit investment loss. Excluding acquisition related costs and the tax credit investment loss, our effective tax rate on adjusted income for the quarter was 19.7%.","Diluted net income per common share for the second quarter 2019 increased to $5.03 per share from $4.25 per share in the prior year's second quarter. Earnings per share in the second quarter of 2019 includes charges for acquisition related costs and a tax credit investment loss of $0.75 and $0.79 per share, respectively. The $4.25 per share reported in the second quarter 2018 included charges for acquisition related costs and environmental expense provisions of $1.23 and $0.25 per share, respectively. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 14.7% to $6.57 in the second quarter 2019 from $5.73 last year. We have summarized the second quarter earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table in our press release.","Let me now take a few moments to break down our performance by segment. Sales for the Americas group in the second quarter increased $131 million or 5% to $2.76 billion. Comparable store sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 4.3% in the quarter. Regionally, in the second quarter, our Southeast division led all divisions, followed by Midwest, Eastern, Southwest and Canada. Sales were positive in every division in the quarter. Second quarter segment profit increased $42.5 million or 7.5% to $612.4 million. Second quarter segment profit margin increased 50 basis points to 22.2% from 21.7% last year.","Turning now to the consumer brands group. Second quarter sales increased $26.7 million or 3.4% to $804.5 million. Sales from continuing operations, excluding approximately $16 million in revenue from the divested Guardsman business, increased 5.6% in the quarter. Second quarter segment profit increased $49.8 million or 54.7% to $140.7 million. Purchase accounting expense decreased segment profit by $22.5 million compared to $28.5 million in the second quarter 2018. Second quarter segment profit margin increased to 17.5% from 11.7% last year. Excluding the purchase accounting expense in both quarters, adjusted segment profit margin increased to 20.3% from 15.4% in the second quarter 2018.","For our performance coatings group, second quarter sales decreased $52.4 million or 3.8% to $1.32 billion. Currency translation rate changes reduced second quarter sales by 2.7%. Second quarter segment profit increased $6.1 million or 4.3% to $150.3 million. Purchase accounting expense decreased segment profit by $53.9 million compared to $47.6 million in the second quarter 2018. Second quarter performance coatings group segment profit margin increased to 11.4% from 10.5% last year. Excluding the purchase accounting expense in both quarters, segment profit margin increased to 15.5% compared to 14% in the second quarter 2018.","I will conclude my remarks with an update on our California lead litigation. As we reported in the press release last week, 10 California cities and counties, Sherwin-Williams and two other companies have mutually agreed to resolve litigation, subject to court approval. The agreement ends a nearly 20-year legal battle that challenged the company's legal advertising of lead-based paints over a century ago when such paints were the gold standard and specified for use by the federal government as well as state and local governments across the country.","Terms of the agreement call for a total payment of $305 million with each defendant paying approximately $101.7 million over six years. The $305 million is a significant reduction from the court's original $1.15 billion judgment and reduced $409 million judgment ruling following the defendants appeal.","Sherwin-Williams continues to believe the California case was an aberration. All other appellate courts have found that companies should not be held retroactively liable for lawful conduct and truthful commercial speech decades after they took place. Seven other states have already rejected public nuisance claims similar to those brought in California. Sherwin-Williams is pleased to have reached an agreement to resolve this litigation and will continue to vigorously and aggressively defend against any similar current or future litigation.","That concludes our review of our operating results for the second quarter. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments on the second quarter and provide our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2019. John?","John Morikis","Thank you Jim and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. I would to make just a few additional comments on our second quarter before moving on to our outlook. Our second quarter was a strong one with record results in net sales, EBITDA, profit before taxes and net operating cash. While consolidated second quarter sales came in at the low end of our expectations, North American paint stores, a growth engine of our company, performed well in the quarter and was above the high end of our revenue guidance as we anticipated.","Overall, our consolidated sales results continue to highlight significant regional and end market demand variability with growth in North America and Latin America, partially offset by softness in Asia and to a lesser degree, Europe. Pricing was favorable across all of our businesses in the quarter. Consolidated gross margin on, an adjusted basis, improved sequentially and year-over-year to 44.9%, just below the low end of our annual long term target. The improvement was driven by the realization of previously announced pricing actions and a sequentially lower rate of raw material inflation.","SG&A in the quarter came in largely as expected and we will continue to maintain appropriate discipline on spending as the year unfolds. All three segments delivered sequential and year-over-year profit margin improvement. Within the Americas group, sales increased 5% against a prior year comparison of 7.7%. Sales were positive in all North American customer end markets in the quarter, led by residential repaint, which was up high single digits.","Sales in protective and marine, new commercial and property management were all up mid single digits and new residential sales were also positive. Selling conditions remain challenging throughout much of the quarter, likely delaying a number of projects in multiple end markets. Our customers continue to report very solid backlogs heading into the back half of the year.","Looking at total segment profitability. Segment profit dollars increased by more than $42 million, segment margin expanded by 50 basis points to 22.2% and incremental margin was 33%. Year-to-date, we have opened 20 net new stores finishing the quarter with 4,716 stores in operation, compared to 4,642 last year. Our plan calls for this team to add approximately 80 to 100 new stores in North America by the end of this year.","In the consumer segment, second quarter sales increased by 3.4%, including the impact of the Guardsman divestiture which was about 2.1%. Sales and profitability improved in North America and Europe but were partially offset by softer demand in Asia and Australia and New Zealand. Volume leverage and cost control, which were partially offset by incremental investments in a new customer program, are enabling us to continue to drive the profitability of this business as segment margin, excluding purchase accounting expense, increased both sequentially and year-over-year to 20.3%. We continue to feel very good about our strategy in this business and in particular our relationship with our largest customer. Performance coatings group sales were down 3.8% in the quarter with variability by region and business.","Comparing businesses, revenue growth in our packaging and coil divisions was more than offset by softness in the segment's other businesses, most notably in our industrial wood division which continues to be impacted by tariffs. Geographically, sales were up in Latin America and flat in North America which were more than offset by softness in Asia and Europe where sales decreased by low double digit and mid single digit percentages, respectively.","Notably, packaging and coil continued to be positive outliers in Asia and Europe. Despite the sales decline, adjusted segment margin increased 150 basis points to 15.5%. Evidence of good cost control and that pricing actions are gaining traction to offset the raw material inflation we have experienced over the last two years. EBITDA in the quarter was $908 million or $921 million adjusted to exclude integration costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.9% in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA year-to-date was $1.5 billion or 16.8% of sales.","Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $650 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 33% year-over-year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $9.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet. We reduced debt by approximately $375 million in the quarter and intend to retire a total of approximately $600 million this year which will result in a net debt to EBITDA ratio below 3:1 by the end of 2019. We paid $105 million in cash dividends and purchased 325,000 shares of common stock for $145 million in the second quarter. At quarter-end, our share repurchase authorization stood at 9.05 million shares.","Capital expenditures was $77 million the quarter. Depreciation was $65 million and amortization was $78 million. As we move into the third quarter 2019, we expect consolidated net sales to increase by a low single digit percentage compared to the third quarter of 2018. Although we do not typically provide quarterly sales guidance by segment, I would like to provide some additional color this quarter due to end market variability.","We expect growth in the Americas group to be in the mid single digit range. I want to reiterate that we continue to feel very good about the demand environment for our North American stores with our customers reporting full order books and working to catch up on jobs, that were likely delayed by weather in the second quarter. For the consumer brands group in the third quarter, we expect sales to be down by high single digit as we face tough comparisons to the largest portion of last year load-in volume through the Lowe's program as well as the final quarter of the divested Guardsman business.","We anticipate performance coatings sales to be up by a low single digit percentage. While comparisons do ease in the back half of the year, we do see a near term catalyst driving significant improvement in the European or Chinese macroeconomic environment at this time. We expect demand in these regions to remain highly variable as it has over the first half of the year compared to a relatively stable demand environment in North America.","As a result of our revenue outlook for the third quarter, we are reducing our full year 2019 revenue guidance and now expect sales to increase 2% to 4% compared to the full year 2018. At the same time, we feel good about North American stores volume in the second half, the progress of our pricing initiatives, the trajectory of raw material inflation and our ability to control spending.","Given these dynamics, we are reaffirming our adjusted 2019 full year diluted net income per common share guidance to be in the range of $20.40 to $21.40 per share which excludes Valspar acquisition related costs and non-operating items. This is an increase of approximately 13% at the midpoint compared to the $18.53 we reported last year on a comparable basis. We have included a Regulation G reconciliation table with this morning's press release to reconcile adjusted and GAAP earnings per share.","A few additional data points for the full year may be helpful for modeling purposes. These data points have not changed from the guidance we updated in April. We expect raw material inflation for full year 2019 will be in the low single digits compared to 2018. The rate of our year-over-year inflation assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and no supply disruptions should diminish from the level we saw in the second quarter as we progress through the year.","We expect incremental synergies of approximately $70 million to $80 million in 2019 with a total annual run rate of approximately $415 million at year-end. We expect our 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. We expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $320 million, depreciation to be about $257 million and amortization to be about $315 million.","With that, I would like to thank you for joining us this morning and we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Your cost of goods sold was down about 1% in the quarter and I imagine your volumes were up. Can you analyze the decrease? How much of that was lower raw materials? And how much of that was cost reduction effort?","Al Mistysyn","Hi Jeff. This is Al Mistysyn. And you are absolutely correct. We did see a sequential decrease in our raw materials from quarter-to-quarter. As we discussed on our first quarter call, we thought the first quarter would be our highest raw material costs year-over-year, declining into the second quarter and then sequentially from there. So a good part of it was raw material cost, but you are absolutely right.","We continue to focus the team on implementing the synergies that we had talked about. We had approximately $75 million in synergies in our guidance. We have talked about two-thirds of that being realized in the first half and the remaining one-third in the second half. And you are seeing the benefit of that as well.","Jeff Zekauskas","And the raw material is continuing to move sequentially lower for you in general?","Al Mistysyn","Correct. And that's what we talked about, Jeff, in our guidance at the beginning of the year and that hasn't dramatically changed. Now what we talked about was low single digits for the full year, probably the highest in the first quarter. The basket ticked down in the second quarter and we think it's reasonable based on what we are seeing now to expect the back half to be slightly deflationary.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hi guys. Good morning. I guess first question, John, on your comments on customer backlogs. Can you sort of expand on those comments? Is it a reflection of just stronger fundamentals, given the drop in interest rates? Or just weather disrupting 2Q and pushing it out into 3Q? What are your customers sharing with you?","John Morikis","Well, I think there is an overall confidence that we started the year with, Ghansham. And I think it's continued as we have progressed through the year. To your point, clearly weather did impact our customers. Not just our customers, I would say all trade. Certainly painters, but construction in general. But I think as we look forward in the back half of the year, it's going to be a dead sprint for our customers.","There is a backlog that they are carrying over and we believe, quite frankly, it's an opportunity for us to shine for our customers, because of the backlog that exists and the demand that they will have on them. We think the position that our teams are in to serve those customers will ultimately end up with customers that have a higher level of loyalty to our people and our stores as a result of the service we provide.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. Thanks for that. And then for my second question, you have had Valspar in your portfolio for a few quarters now and the industrial facing business is already facing a tougher macro economic backdrop, especially overseas. How are these businesses performing relative to your initial expectations from a cyclicality standpoint? How would you characterize that?","John Morikis","Well, we are very pleased, as you would expect. And these businesses are doing very well. If you look at packaging, for example, we had growth in all regions and we continue to focus on great relationships with great innovation to help grow that business. Our coil was strong across all regions except for North America, which was down slightly and I would say that was largely the impact of some of the tariffs.","When we look at the opportunities from a market share standpoint and the growth opportunities, we are really very, very excited. Our challenge right now is prioritization. As we move forward, there are terrific opportunities, terrific customers. We have just got to make sure we are focusing on the right opportunities and executing well.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. Thanks again.","John Morikis","Thanks Ghansham.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Koort","Thanks very much. Can you give a more granularity on the big margin lift in consumer brands sort of the buckets where that came from whether it was costs, price, raws, et cetera?","John Morikis","Sure, Bob. Yes, there is a number of levers, starting with the strong volume performance we saw in North America. And as you know, we always start with volume, because that's the one that gives us the most leverage from an operating margin standpoint. We did get a little bit of a benefit from the raw material decrease sequentially. The synergies that I talked about with Jeff also impacted our consumer brands group in the quarter. So you are seeing the nice volume lift in North America and those are other two factors is what's helped driving that margin expansion.","Robert Koort","Great. Thanks John.","John Morikis","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Parkinson","Great. Thanks. In terms of the Lowe's agreement, do you just have any general views on how much of the legacy business at Home Depot that Thompson's, Minwax, Purdy, et cetera you have recaptured thus far and how much there more is to go? And just do you have any additional programs in the pipeline to further help Lowe's close the gap with Home Depot, maybe at pros, et cetera? Thank you.","John Morikis","Yes. Chris, we have a number of programs, initiatives and focus on execution on those that are out already. So yes, I think that we have a number of initiatives and programs for our customer and we are really focused on the execution. As you would expect, we are not going to disclose what those are here on this call, but we clearly have a terrific relationship in a lot of areas that we are focused on to grow.","Christopher Parkinson","Right. And just in PC, can you comment broadly just about how you are feeling the longer term competitive positioning in each of those markets, pricing power ability and just how those views funnel into your longer term outlook for PC margins. Thank you.","John Morikis","Yes. So we have spoken about our goal to drive this business up to a 20% operating margin and we feel as though the businesses, the customers, the technology all give us even more confidence than when we initiated this acquisition. The key area here is our focus on the solutions that will help our customers to be more successful. When we look at this business, we are not driving and chasing every shiny object.","We are really focused on those areas that are meaningful for our customers that allow them to reach and exceed their goals and in turn allow us to provide a reward for our shareholders. So we are very focused on the right customers, the right programs, the right technologies, having the right people at the right place doing the right things that drive these results. And we have great confidence in our ability to do that.","Al Mistysyn","And Chris, I would just add to that. On the pricing side, you can see, after two significant raw material inflationary years in the past few years plus the inflation we saw year-over-year in our first quarter, our adjusted operating margin improved 150 basis points in the quarter. That tells you we have to be getting price to be able to get on top of that raw material inflation.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thank you Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Byrne","Yes. Thank you. How have your new stores that you are building now compare to your legacy stores with respect to size? Does that affect the cost to build out these stores and the operating cost of these stores? And has your view of optimal store density changed?","John Morikis","Yes. Steve, I think they are changing. And I think I would describe it this way. Historically, when I was in our stores organization, we typically look for 5,000 square feet. That was the model we tried to put those everywhere. Now, I would say that our teams and we have terrific leadership teams here, 30-years plus experience with Peter Ippolito, Bill DeSantis. I mean these people really have been with our team for quite a bit of time and they are really driving us to be more responsive and more selective in what it is that we are doing to drive the results in the markets that we need.","In some cases, we might be going with a little smaller stores. In some cases we might go a little larger store. We are focused on these different end markets. And so we are tailoring the footprint and the store as well as the staffing to be responsive to those segments that we are pursuing. So I would say they are adjusting. You are exactly right, but it's not adjusting one way or the other. It's adjusting more to reflect the market opportunities.","Steve Byrne","And the optimal store density, any update on that?","John Morikis","No. I would say, we are still continuing to learn. We continue to add stores. And I would say that we have not reached a saturation point here where we are saying we are not going to add any more stores. We can point to markets like Cleveland or Atlanta where our saturation is stronger than some other markets and we still need stores in these markets. And we are excited to continue to add them.","And I would also say that our field organization is doing a better job of getting these stores up and profitable faster as well We are students of continuous improvement. So these new stores are a focus. We don't just plug them in and wait for them to get better. Every day, we have teams working on how do we get these new stores up and profitable faster.","Steve Byrne","And just a quick one on the consumer segment. Any changes in the spray paint business at Lowe's?","John Morikis","There is not a meaningful change. There was, I believe, some area outside of the paint department that there were some adjustments. But we are really focused with this customer on making that paint department the most successful it can be. And that's what we are really focused on.","Steve Byrne","Okay. Thank you.","John Morikis","Thank you Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Duffy Fischer","Yes. Good morning. In the PC segment in particular, can you talk about what you are seeing from your customers as far as their inventory? Are they destocking your products? Is that part of the volume issue there? Or do you think that's just closer to their real demand and consumption?","John Morikis","I would say their consumption is a bit choppier, Duffy. I would say the demand, it's not a smooth line up, down or sideways. There's choppiness. And so we are starting to see, I wouldn't say starting to see, we have seen perhaps more orders of smaller volume as they are trying to adjust their inventories. From our perspective, the ability to serve those customers with our facilities close to these customers, with a quick response and platforms that we are building to be more responsive, we think it's a way of differentiating with our customers.","Jim Jaye","And Duffy, I would just add to that. John talked about the macroeconomic headwinds we are seeing in China that have continued through the first quarter and in Europe. We don't expect those to get materially better. That being said, we have had businesses that we called out packaging and coil that are still performing well. Latin America has performed well in the quarter for industrial and we still feel most optimistic about North America.","Duffy Fischer","Okay. And then the change that Ace Hardware made, is that big enough that that will be seen in your results? And if so, kind of what's the timing of that?","John Morikis","I will let Al in a second talk about the impact on financials. But I will say, they have announced a decision to augment their assortment with Benjamin Moore and they will continue to offer many of our well-known brands, the Minwax, Thompson's, Cabot, Purdy. And this was a deal that we assumed with the Valspar acquisition and the program itself had many assumptions in it that really just didn't play out. And as you would expect, we have began reviewing these programs. We found ourselves where a mutually beneficial path forward was difficult to construct and under in terms of that agreement, we felt as though our view is, we have got to be focused on those areas that we can drive meaningful results for those customers, but also in the same token, the results for our shareholders.","Al Mistysyn","And the timing is such, Duffy, that we don't believe there's going to be any material impact on our 2019 results. From an operating margin standpoint, it's well below the segment average. But we did include those both the topline and bottomline impacts on our 2020 guidance.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the paint stores comp in the quarter, which was quite impressive given the weather and some of the third-party data that's out there. So I guess a couple of questions to this. I know there were some initiatives starting a couple of years ago to really go out and try to build the customer base. So maybe you could discuss on if you have sort of reached a tipping point on that and\/or strategically you figured out a better way to serve clients and to pick up incremental share when the conditions are challenging, does your service offering play a real role in that?","John Morikis","Yes. Well, let me begin by pointing out that Q2 was the toughest comparison to last year. Same-store sales were up 6.8%. So comps were tough and you are right, our team has finished up 5.3%. And this focus that we have been talking about, our new accounts and share of wallet, even the new products that we are introducing, those efforts are clearly coming to fruition. It was wet, no question about it and it impacted, as I mentioned earlier, both the painters and all trades. By some measures out there, this was the wettest in 125 years.","But this as you mentioned is a resilient team. As I mentioned earlier, we have got great leadership. And this is a point where we love our model and the position that we have in the market and our team is executing very well. Are we doing anything specifically different? I would say, we continue to train our people. We continue to hire the best people we can. We have talked openly about hiring around 1,400 college graduates a year to ensure that we have got a steady pipeline of people. And we continue to focus on the training that will allow them to differentiate.","When you look at some of the areas inside the store with staffing and the quality of people, even the inventory you might notice that we have had a slight uptick in our inventory. That's nearly all in the architectural business. We want to make sure we have the inventory when they need it, close to the customers and we are really focused on those areas that will help our customers be on the job and most productive.","The products that we are introducing are helping them. The services that we are introducing. But there is not one silver bullet that we would say, this is what we did this quarter. I would say, it's a culmination of many, many years of good leadership by that team and a lot of execution in the field. I want to thank our teams in the field, because they are doing a terrific job representing our company.","Vincent Andrews","And just maybe as a follow-up, if you could give us sort of your sense of where the M&A outlook is both for small transactions and then something potentially larger than that, particularly given one of the announcements that was out there by a large competitor?","John Morikis","Yes. So there are number of comments out there regarding what's out in the market. We don't make a practice to talk about any particular project. I will say, because I have been consistent in this though that we have been very clear in our position on automotive OEM and it's not an area of interest for us. As far as M&A, I would say we are very, very active. We are pleased with the progress that we have on a number of projects and we think it's an important part of what it's going to help us grow, but we don't feel that we are sitting here with the absolute need for acquisitions to grow. We think it's an opportunity, but we have got a lot of growth opportunities and sales synergies as Valspar and Sherwin come together.","Al Mistysyn","And Vincent, I would just like to add to that that M&A is an important part of our capital allocation policy, as we discussed in June. As John mentioned on his opening remarks, we returned $660 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. It was 33% increase year-over-year. We are going to, with CapEx, continue to invest in growth opportunities, in new stores and in capacity expansions in a number of our North American businesses. And then as we talked about the dividends up 31%, but absent M&A we are going to continue to buy back our stock.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Very clear. Thanks very much guys.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","John Morikis","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar","John, I think you talked about your consumers brands margins jumping up 580 basis points and some factors behind that. I was wondering, if you can talk about how different brands like Valspar HGTV Paint are doing at Lowe's? And were there any surprises positive or negative in your first full season?","John Morikis","Well, we are not going to talk specifically on any brands, but I will just say that the process that we are going through with Lowe's, we continue to learn. I think we are trying to be responsive and we believe that we are very driven. I mentioned earlier a continuous improvement mentality here. We think that as we go through this, it's important that our efforts are always on finding where we are and how we get better. And I think we share that culture, not only with Lowe's.","Lowe's is a terrifically important customer, but if you look at other customers like Menards and others, I mean that's our mentality. It is to gain alignment and seek improvement. And so I don't want to get into any specific profitability of brands, products, SKUs, any of that. But I would tell you that when we set these goals to march up into the 20% operating margins for this business, we know that there is improvement needed and it's not just going to be by setting the can on the shelf. We want to help our customer succeed and that's in all facets of the business.","P.J. Juvekar","Okay. And then back in June, you pushed out your 2020 goals due to mostly higher raw materials. But since then the raw materials, particularly ethylene, propylene trends have really come down. Your margins seem to be improving here despite a difficult weather quarter or weather-wise quarter. So do you have any updated comments on your 2020 goals as we sit here today?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, P.J. We are very pleased with the progress we are making on the gross margins, 44.9% in the quarter, saw a nice improvement there. But year-to-date, our gross margins are 44% and the pricing activity that we have had needs to continue. As you know, our long-term rates are 45% to 48%. So we have work to do to get to that. And I expect as we progress obviously and I talked about this on the previous call, to get to almost 13% increase at our midpoint for EPS, we are going to need margin expansion and we are up 9.5% year-to-date. That tells you we have to be up a little bit over 16% in the second half to get to that midpoint. And that tells you, we do expect margins to continue to expand in the second half.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks, P.J.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Melich","Hi. Thanks. I have two questions, both on the outlook as much as what we just saw. If we look at the Americas business, to get that mid-single-digit growth in the third quarter, is that going to be more volume or price, especially if you consider, it looks like the second quarter was probably 2% volume and 2% price if I look at the comp? Is that correct?","Al Mistysyn","Hi Greg. I think the price will be a little bit better than that, maybe closer to 2.5%.And I would expect a similar type of cadence in our third quarter, which would tell you that we have to be up low to mid single digits in volume. But I do expect volume to improve sequentially.","Greg Melich","So an acceleration in comp in the third quarter is more likely to be volume than price?","Al Mistysyn","Correct.","Greg Melich","And then second on consumer brands. Just a little more color on the inflection of it being up to go into down high single digits. I think you mentioned it was the cycle and just load-in and then Guardsman. Is there anything else there? And then how should we think about when those items cycle for the fourth quarter and beyond?","John Morikis","I think like we talked about it in the second quarter, we feel very good about North American volume. We did see some softness or continued softness in the retail channel. I would expect that to continue. And then outside of that, we have a couple of our smaller businesses outside the U.S., specifically Asia and Australia that were soft in the first half. I don't expect them to get materially better in the second half.","Greg Melich","So that decline that you see in the third quarter could also persist beyond?","John Morikis","Not to the degree. Our largest load-in was in the third quarter for Lowe's. The headwind of Guardsman goes away after the third quarter. So I think materially --","Al Mistysyn","Yes. I would say, yes, it's largely the load-in and Guardsman annualization.","John Morikis","That's right.","Greg Melich","Got it. That's great and then just if I could sneak in one more on the three times leverage and getting to that point. How important is that point to where you would -- where do you want that to stabilize when you think about, you mentioned buying back stock after you get through the dividend increase and invest in CapEx?","Al Mistysyn","Yes. Greg, we are committed to -- yes, I think long term, we have talked about two to 2.5. We will be under three by the end of this year. We committed to paying down $600 million of debt. We paid off the $300 million of 7.25% debt in June and the rest will come out of short term. But yes, I think we will be below 3:1 at the end of this year and the target is still two to 2.5.","Greg Melich","That's great. Thanks guys. Good luck.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks Greg.","Jim Jaye","Thank you Greg.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts","Thank you. What's going on in coil that's allowing that business to be an outlier in industrial coatings?","John Morikis","Well, we have got a lot of good products and a lot of really good people serving really good customers, John. I don't think there is a blanket statement that we would make across the board except that we have got some really good things that are happening and we are determined to continue to drive them.","John Roberts","Okay. And then in industrial wood, do you need to restructure that business? Or do you just wait to see how the trade issues play out?","John Morikis","No, that's a good question. We are forced to take some cost out of that business. We have seen a material change in the market at least for the time being and we are adjusting accordingly as you would expect.","John Roberts","Thank you.","John Morikis","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Mushkin","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess I wanted to poke a little bit more on the volume outlook. I think last call I asked what would generate upside surprise and you guys said increased volumes over expectations. So it seems like volumes did come in better in the second quarter, maybe the volume outlook. I am specifically talking to the Americas. And I am just wondering what's changed in the thought on volumes? Is it the market? Is it the things you guys are doing specifically? And then I had a follow-up.","John Morikis","Yes, Scott. Coming into the quarter, we talked about our paint stores group being at or above the high end of our range and that happened. They were up 5.3% and that was a positive even in spite of the wet weather we saw. Our consumer group came in pretty much as we expected, but it's a tale of two cities, if you will. We had strong growth in our North America business even including the soft retail sales that I talked about. But we also saw a continued softness in Asia-Pacific and Australia. And I expect those to continue. And they are probably softer than what we had planned.","And then finally in performance coatings group is where we really saw softness, Asia-Pacific and Europe, with the macroeconomic headwinds. Although we expected them to continue in the second quarter, we did not expect them to be as heavy as they were. So that again we expect to continue in our second half. So I would say we have to be realistic about the forecast.","Our teams have opportunities and they wake up every day driving market share growth with new products and leveraging technology and services to provide solutions to our customers. But it's very difficult to come over the top when we are seeing the headwinds we are seeing from a macroeconomic environment.","So that's really what we are seeing. It's continued retail sales softness and more than we expected in consumer along with Asia-Pacific and ANZ and then in performance coatings was primarily Asia-Pacific and Europe.","Scott Mushkin","Perfect. And my follow-up is just, again, it goes to the paint store group of the Americas. I know you guys have been pretty active in remodeling stores and just wanted to get any color you have there. How much of that, the comp, is being attributed to that activity? So any update there would be great.","John Morikis","Yes. I would say we have always maintained a commitment to, what we call, store readiness, the appearance and that includes not only just the physical appearance, the painting and displays, but even our employees. And I would say it's a contributing factor. But Scott as we look at the model there, it's really important to understand that there is not one lever. We want to continue adding in those areas, the services, the quality of products and the differentiation that helps our customers to be the most successful.","And if we continue to do that and help our customers to win and then funny thing happens. We become successful as well. And so that's what we are really focused on. I know there have been a couple of questions now pointing to, is there one thing here? And this is just a continuation of a long strategy executed by really wonderful leadership and outstanding people in the field.","Scott Mushkin","Appreciate it, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Thank you Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. Just a question on the outlook you provided. It sounds like there is an element of conservatism in your PCG outlook and it's related to kind of macro challenges in Europe and China still remaining weak. I guess, is that correct? And if there is some resolution on the trade side, do you see that kind of helping you to get to the upper end of guidance? Or how should we think about the range you have provided with regards to PCG? Thanks.","John Morikis","Yes, Arun. I won't use the term conservatism. I would say realistic is more apt to be how we have approached the forecast. If the trade wars ended today, it will not help us through the rest of this year. Many of those customers and we have tried to characterize this in the past have already decided to move and that process has started. It's tough for them to stop and then start. But we are well positioned to accept that business and wherever they go, whether it's in Southeast Asia, if they come to Mexico, wherever those businesses land.","What will drive the needle on our guidance towards the high end is North America stores volume. And that's always the case. It's the growth engine of our company. We expect to continue to grow our market share and grow 1.5 to two times the market. And I believe we are doing that in the second quarter. And I believe we will do that through the back half. It's just that that will be what drives it to the high end of the range.","Arun Viswanathan","And just on that point, it sounds like resi repayments are still holding up pretty nicely, high single digits, commercial likely is pretty strong. So it seems like most of your end markets are doing quite well, but you do face tough comps there. So what gives you the confidence that some of these markets will continue to grow so heavily, especially resi repaint where we have seen double digit quarters for many years here?","John Morikis","So I think it's five years compounded growth rate of double digits. You are right, Arun. And I would say this, as far as your comp question, the back half of the year actually gets a little bit easier. It was the first half that was a little tougher. And in fact, the second quarter itself was the toughest comparison. So from that standpoint, we feel the comparisons get a little bit easier.","We don't like to fly the victory flag as a result of easy comparisons. I mean it's a reality. But what we are really trying to do is continue to invest in those areas that allow us to continue to grow our account base and our share of wallet with those customers. And so all of these initiatives, it's the new products, it's the skill training that we have put with our employees, the addition of specification reps. I mean you can go through the long list of things that we are doing.","All of those we think are driving in the right direction and we are going to continue to feed this. We have said it number of times already this morning. It's the engine of the company. We are going to continue to put fuel in this machine and push it as fast and as hard as we can go.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Good morning. Mortgage rates, as you know, have fallen more than a full percentage point since last November. My question is, if you look back at history, can you speak to how lower mortgage rates flow through to demand for architectural paint? And if there is a positive linkage there, what sort of lag effects should we be thinking about in terms of impact on remodeling or existing homes? Any thoughts along those lines would be appreciated.","Jim Jaye","Sure. I think the drop in rates over the last few months in general is supportive of new build. If you look at builder sentiment, most recent data that I have seen is June and builder sentiment is pretty positive in June. But I think, Kevin, what's fundamentally the driver and we have talked about this for several quarters now, is the rate of household formation which continues to be very strong but new home construction has not been keeping up with that. It's been unsustainably low.","So we think there is still some pent-up demand out there that eventually, if certainly there is demand out there for new homes especially at the entry level and that's what we are starting to see some of the builders are adjusting to that. We had positive growth in the new res space than our first quarter.","From a remodeling perspective, one of the things that people often point to is existing home sales and that's been very choppy over the last year or so. New data was out this morning that wasn't particularly great, but at the same time there is a lot of other drivers beyond existing home sales that I think are helpful for remodeling in the repaint business for us.","So you have things like baby boomers aging in place and they are doing a lot of remodeling to make homes the way they want them to be. You have strong employment numbers. You have home value appreciation continuing to move in the right direction, maybe a little bit slower than the past, but still continuing to appreciate.","And the other thing I would point out, a fact that we presented at our Analyst Day as well is, since the last peak, there has been about close to 20% growth in the square footage that's out there to be repainted. And so we think there is plenty of demand out there in the repaint. We are very well positioned to continue growing that part of our business.","Kevin McCarthy","Thanks for that Jim. As a brief follow-up, with that as the backdrop, would you be confident that industry architectural gallonage can rise directionally in 2020?","Jim Jaye","I don't want to comment specifically on an outlook for 2020, but we have seen gallon growth over the last several years. And I think based on some of those factors that I have just said, the pent-up demand and the increased square footage that's out there, yes, I think we can see gallon growth continue to improve.","Kevin McCarthy","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Sison","Hi guys, nice quarter. Still waiting on my Bob mural. So hopefully that's not part of cost savings. On a serious note, when you think about the Americas Group, the outlook for the second half of the year, the first half you had weather issues. And if weather is favorable and the backlog for your customers are really good, where could growth be? Could it be a couple of percent better if weather plays its part?","John Morikis","Yes. I mean it's really hard to speculate. Mike, you are right. I mean, I think if the weather is better, we have a more mild entry into winter and our customers are able to paint a little bit longer or they are able to capitalize on the weather and catch-up on some of these projects. It would definitely add to what it is that that we have projected.","But as Al mentioned, we are trying to be realistic. We are in the midst of some pretty unique weather patterns and we don't know what's going to happen, not that anyone does. And for our forecast, we think, reflects the best that we have as far as our low crystal ball.","As it relates to the customer though and the demand, that's the piece that we are blessed with. We have got over 4,000 stores, over 3,000 territories out there. We are getting the feedback from our store managers. We get the feedback from our reps about how our customers are feeling. That's the most important part to us. If it gets delayed, it gets delayed. I mean we don't think those projects are going to go away. But what we are confident is how our customers are feeling about their pipeline of projects.","Mike Sison","Got it. And then as a quick follow-up, how are you thinking about pricing for the store heading in the 2020? Every year, it's hard to tell what inflation is going to do. But just when you think about use the October-ish, you start to think about some sort of pricing actions potentially. Can you maybe give us an update on your current thoughts there?","John Morikis","Yes. I would tell you more about how we think about it than our current thoughts and we get together on a monthly basis. We look at our total cost basket, not just raw materials, but just total costs. And we make a very informed decision as a team on a monthly basis. And as you know, given your coverage of our company, the first people to know that clearly are our employees, the second, our customers and then we go public with our investment community. So we have nothing to announce right now. We will stay close to it and we will make adjustments as needed.","Mike Sison","Great. Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter","Thank you. John, to following up the prior question, if you do see deflation in raw materials, what areas are you most at risk for giving back some pricing? I assume it's not the stores, but perhaps performance. Is that fair?","John Morikis","Well, you know, what we have typically have seen over a long history is that on some of these large projects as it relates to the stores more stadium or very large kind of marquee projects on the store side, those might get a little pressure overall. And on the performance coatings side, you know, I was very deliberate in my conversation or my response there earlier about looking at total costs.","We ere continuing to add in those areas that we believe can help our customers reach their goals. And some of it clearly is in the raw material cost and other areas it could be in facilities or different investments that we might make to help a customer be more successful and more profitable themselves. So as we look at it. I would say that it's a discussion that we always have to have, but the discussion isn't a discussion that takes place on one day. If we are doing our job all year, we are doing our job in delivering the solutions and services that allow our customers to be successful. That conversation is a better discussion and one that our customers understand the need for us to stay healthy as well.","David Begleiter","And John, just on TiO2, do you expect to pay higher prices for TiO2 in the back half of the year than the first half of the year?","Jim Jaye","Yes, this is Jim. Industry pricing for TiO2 has been fairly stable over the past three quarters and we don't see anything really changing a whole lot in the global demand environment, favorable or unfavorable. So our view at the beginning of the year was TiO2 fairly stable for the year and I think that's still our view at this point.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Garik Shmois","Thank you. I am just wondering if you can comment on if new residential construction does increase in the second half of the year, just given some of the leading indicators that you cited, what's the usual lag between when starts increase and when you start seeing that demand come through?","John Morikis","I would typically see it in a few months.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Has that changed over the last several years? Has that lag gotten extended due to weather, labor constraints or any other factors?","John Morikis","Yes. It may push it back depending on the market, I would say. It may get pushed back or be a little more volatile in some markets where the labor shortages might be a little tougher to your point. But I don't know that it's a material amount.","Garik Shmois","Okay.","John Morikis","The builders are clearly working on how to deliver efficiency into their process. So there is some opportunity there from a speed standpoint, but there is some volatility, to your point, about labor as well.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Thanks for that. I just want to follow-up on consumer. You talked about some of the comp headwinds you are facing in the third quarter, but should we expect volume growth to turn positive in the fourth quarter as you anniversary the Lowe's load-in and the Guardsman exit?","Jim Jaye","I would say, Garik, we got to see how the inventory levels, what happens to the inventory levels as we come out of season. Obviously, we are working closely with Lowe's. But last year being the first year and we are putting a ton of inventory in to make sure we are servicing these end customers, it's an anomaly. So this year is the first year where we are going to see a more normalized run rate and process and we are still going through that right now with them.","John Morikis","But importantly, I think the core of the question is, we do expect to help our customers grow their business.","Garik Shmois","Okay.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Harrison","Hi. Good afternoon.","John Morikis","Hi Mike.","Jim Jaye","Hi Mike.","Mike Harrison","I was wondering if you could maybe break out the same-store sales growth number between exterior and interior? Is it fair to assume that the exterior growth was much weaker?","John Morikis","No, actually broader markets, the exterior, believe it or not, was up slightly ahead of interior. And when we went back and started the dial-in on that, what we saw were on those days when the weather had been supportive of exterior paint, we saw some really incredible increases. And so we saw chunks of business going out on the exterior side, which gives us great confidence in the future if we get a little more stable weather pattern of what we are capable of. But we had a very good performance in both interior and exterior.","Mike Harrison","And then I wanted to ask also, you made several references in the press release and then in your comments to cost controls or cost management. I know you mentioned specifically that you were taking some actions in industrial wood coatings. But are there some other areas where you are taking additional actions? Or should we think of these as being part of the Valspar synergies? Just how do we think about that cost management that's going on?","Jim Jaye","Yes, Mike. I think part of it is the Valspar synergies, part of it is just our normal part of our culture of continuous improvement. And as we talked about going into 2020, we are not going to be calling out synergies because we want to roll that into just part of our culture. And you could expect, as John talked about, we are going to take action where we need to in certain, whether it's markets or geographies or parts of our business where we see softness and continued softness over a period of time. On the other hand, you are going to see us continue to invest in growth opportunities whether that be in our stores group, consumer group programs or performance coatings to drive future sales.","Mike Harrison","Thank you very much.","Jim Jaye","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of things. Number one, as you look at your margin recovery in performance coatings, you talked about continuing to sort of press for pricing. I am just trying to understand if by that you mean getting greater traction on the pricing you have implemented at the end of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019? Or do you plan on going out with new pricing as the year unfolds because you feel that you still have a couple of quarters of catch-up to do? And then secondly, if it's the latter, how does that jive with the slowing industrial markets that you are seeing beyond wood just in general sort of macro slowing in industrial, not necessarily maybe in your business.","John Morikis","Hi Dmitry. I would respond that we have a little bit of everything that you have talked about. We have got some areas where we have already had those discussions and we are working with our customers, rolling pricing in and we have some areas where, if you look reflective in the past here on what's happening to raw material costs, we are yet to recover some of what has rolled in, in raw material costs. While there might be some relief, the basket is still higher in some products in some areas than when it was in 2016.","And so we are having those discussions on a customer-by-customer basis and our goal, I know it sounds a bit repetitive here but in helping our customers to be most successful and helping them by bringing in the solutions that help them win. We need to stay healthy as well and we are having those discussions on a regular basis.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up staying with the industrial theme. You talked about the coil coatings being a standout for you in terms of growth and wood coatings obviously for last couple of quarters has been problem child and that's totally understandable. Can you talk about perhaps maybe not regionally but so much as sort of a product type, if you will, what your other businesses in industrial in performance coatings have done in the second quarter and what your outlook for the second half of the year is in terms of capital projects or protective and marine? I know you are in pipeline business and a few other businesses as well. So if you can kind of look at maybe end-market or product categories and give us a little bit more granularity on what your view is of the market.","John Morikis","Sure, Dmitry. Maybe if I break it down a little bit by region initially and just tell you in North America overall, I would say it was flattish. Our general industrial business was positive and we expect that to continue here. Europe, I would say was soft for the most part, excluding as I mentioned, packaging and coil. And I want to give our packaging team their due. I have spoken about coil, but really it's packaging that's leading the pack. So I don't want to get a phone call this calls over from my President, Sam, in our packaging business to correct me here. They are doing a terrific job. So I want to give them their due.","Asia-Pacific was soft overall, again packaging and coil were the exceptions here. Both of those were up double digits in Asia. And we expect that to continue in both packaging and coil. And Latin America was positive in every category as well.","So our focus, giving you the best forecast, we don't generally like to forecast by segment, but I would say that we don't see a lot of change to what's happening right now. We expect to continue to grow in those markets and continue to work closely with our teams to make sure they have the resources that they need to win. And as I mentioned earlier, every day we feel like as though we have to earn the business that we have and when we are blessed enough to work with some of these new customers, we are focused on making them successful.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. That's fair and thankful.","John Morikis","Thank you Dmitry.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Truman Patterson","Hi. Good morning guys and nice quarter. First, I just wanted to look at your EPS guidance. You all lowered your sales guidance from about 5.5% at the midpoint to 3%, so a decent deceleration, if you will. But you left EPS guidance unchanged. Could you just walk us through some of the positive offsets relative to your prior expectations? Are raw materials easing more, getting better pricing power synergies, cost controls or anything like that relative to your prior expectations that help EPS unchanged?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Truman. I think part of it is volume in North America and the continued strength that we see in our North America stores. If you think about the TAG organization in the second quarter, they had flow-through of over 32%. And you asked the question on the first quarter we are down 80 basis points and what is the outlook for that TAG organization? And we said, we are confident in our ability to grow our operating margin year-over-year. We were up 50 basis points in a considerably bigger quarter. That bring us about flat and we are optimistic about the continued progress we are going to make in that group. It's the largest segment we have. It's the fastest growing.","The other segments, we talked about the softness outside of the U.S., but continued progress in holding the price with raws flattening as we need to keep that price to get back up to whole on our margins over the past few years and then synergies that continue to flow through both first half and second half. So it's really a combination of a number of things and mix being one of them. The bigger, faster stores in North America stores growth. It's our highest margin business that's going to help drive the margin and drive our EPS.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Thanks for that. And then jumping back to a few previous questions on performance coatings. Revenues fell 4% in the quarter. It looks like demand will be a bit of a headwind in the back half of the year as well. Could you just run us through how pricing has acted historically in this type of environment? And really what I am trying to look at is, in the back half of 2019, do you think you can improve your operating margin sequentially versus the second quarter because in the past couple of years, you guys have mentioned an ability to do that?","John Morikis","Yes. Truman, one point that before jumping into that is, you are exactly right on the numbers but I would also point out that the comp for the quarter was 11% for the PCG. So some tough comparisons there. But I think if you look at the pricing historically what has happened and this is over decades and not just Sherwin but also Valspar is that we have historically gone out with pricing and we have worked with our customers to get the pricing into the market. Our goal has always been to get the pricing and retain the customer.","And I would say that in this time of integration, we have been very open with our customers about our willingness to work with them in stepping this pricing in. But the fact that we needed to get the pricing and during that same time we have been working very, very hard to provide those solutions if its products, services, whatever it might be to make them more successful. And our success in rolling this in is evidenced by the most recent quarter in our results, we think, continues to point in the right direction going forward and we are never going to reach the point here where we just say, we can't do better or we don't expect this improvement. We clearly see opportunity for improvement. This was a better performing business. We need to get back to those levels and our teams understand that and we are working hard to get it.","Truman Patterson","All right. Thank you guys.","John Morikis","Thank you Truman.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Speer","Thanks for the time guys. Just a few questions or two questions. One, if you could characterize the monthly cadence trends in the quarter and maybe even into July thus far in your core Americas business?","John Morikis","Yes. I would say, Justin, July is in line with the quarterly guidance we have provided for that business. In the quarter, it's hard to look when you have date changes in that. We talked about even I have gotten a number of notes about maybe and what it may in the history of mankind. So as you would expect, there are ups and downs within a quarter depending on weather patterns. So it's hard to point to one month and say, okay, that was good and this one's softer because of that. So we feel good about the 4.3 same-store sales growth on top of a 6.8 same-store sales growth last year.","Justin Speer","Okay. And then the one thing that stood out to me in the quarter positively as well was the cash flow side of things. Very strong in the first half of the year, but particularly in the second quarter. I don't think we have your cash flow yet out from your filing. But just trying to get a sense for what drove that above and beyond working capital. Was there any one-time item that explains the strength there? And how should we think about the full year free cash flow as a percentage of revenues this year, given how strong the first half has been thus far?","John Morikis","Yes. We did have a very strong first half, $758 million, up $179 million year-over-year. Core net income and earnings always is a big driver. Our working capital was a lower use of cash. So even though we are carrying more architectural inventory like we talked about into the end of year and into the first quarter, you start seeing that improve as the year goes on and we get to the summer selling season.","So I would expect some benefit there. Not any real one-timers, I would say. You look at free cash flow, again, we are targeting and modified, I would say, free cash flow over 11%. We are going to make progress towards that. I am not committing that we will get to it exactly this year. But we are certainly going to make progress through that this year.","Justin Speer","Okay. And then a lot of people picking at this question a lot of different ways and I know you are in terms of reading the tea leaves for performance coatings, you recast your view in terms of the timing of achievement of the margin goal, the intermediate term destination for performance coatings. Is there anything incrementally in the softening macro environment that dissuades you from achieving that goal? It sounds like you are still confident. But does this make it a harder put in terms of slower conditions than maybe what we are thinking even a few months ago?","John Morikis","Yes. For our businesses, we get the most leverage out of volume. If you get projected macroeconomic headwinds for longer periods of time, we had talked even in our first quarter that we thought we would get past these trade impacts and we will start seeing a better cadence into our second half. We still may. I talked about maybe not helping our guidance number for this year, but certainly heading into next year. That remains to be seen.","So it's hard to predict when these businesses come back. That being said, like I talked about, we have market share opportunities in all our businesses across all our regions and we have people waking up every day, trying to drive growth in those businesses aside from any macroeconomic headwinds. So we are still confident about getting the high-teens, low-20s, timing. If it moves a little bit, it moves a little bit. But we are committed to hitting those and we believe we can.","Justin Speer","Excellent. Thank you guys.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.","Chuck Cerankosky","Good afternoon everyone. Just an all-in quick question before a financial question for Al. I saw, John, you opened I think five paint stores in the quarter versus 18 or so in the second quarter last year. Was Sherwin itself delayed by the weather in getting the stores open?","John Morikis","Well, we had some, I am sure but we had some impact. I think our net stores there.","Jim Jaye","Yes, that's our net store number. For the six months, we have opened 29 new stores versus 33 last year. In that TAG number, we have some closures in Latin America. We did have some closures in North America. But this is a process that we go through every quarter, every year looking at stores and trying to refine the base to be more effective, both on the topline and our bottomline. So I wouldn't read into it anything as far as the net new stores. But we are still going to open 80 to 100 stores and we may net a little bit below that.","Chuck Cerankosky","Okay. And more importantly, looking, Al, as you are paying down $600 million in debt, good free cash flow behind the company. With the stock price where it's at, do you lean towards paying down more debt than that? Or do you bite the bullet and the year as you would like to say without cash and buyback the stock?","Al Mistysyn","Yes. Chuck, we are going to be consistent in that approach. We are not going to hold cash and like I said a bit earlier, absent M&A, we believe our stock price has good value and we will continue to opportunistically buy it.","Chuck Cerankosky","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks Chuck.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with G. Research. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for hanging on for me. I was wondering if you could give us a little more details on the performance coatings, the packaging side of it. Where do you see most of the growth? Is it on the food cans? Is it on beverages? And considering that there was some kind of a secular decline in North America, where are you seeing the growth?","John Morikis","Well, we are experiencing good growth across the markets. Rosemarie, if you go back to the comments I made about the European, Asian and Latin America growth of packaging, it may vary a little bit in each of those segments. If you had a lean one way or the other, I would say, probably beverage a little bit slightly higher than food. But we are, by market, focused on those areas with the greatest opportunities.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. And then I was wondering with the election of Johnson as the new Prime Minister in the U.K., is that and his expectations of getting out of Brexit regardless and how? Is that changing your U.K. strategy or European strategy, for that matter?","John Morikis","Well, we have put a number of war games on this as you would expect. From an inventory standpoint, we have built up, we have taken down, we have built up and now we have taken down again. We will play this out business by business to understand the best approach. Our supply chain teams have really dialed into this as well as our procurement teams. So at the core of the question, I think you should know that we have looked at this as a number of different ways and we will be responsive by business and with our vendors and suppliers to make sure that they were positioned properly in the market.","Rosemarie Morbelli","So you don't think it could have a negative impact based on what you are doing?","John Morikis","No, I don't think it would be significant. But like you and everyone else, we are going to stay close to it and adjust accordingly.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you. And just lastly if I may, if since you are out of the private label at Ace, my conclusion, based on your comments, would be that, yes, it will have an impact on the revenue side in 2020, but we could see higher margin just on that particular piece of the business. Am I correct?","Al Mistysyn","That's fair, Rosemarie.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. Great. Thank you.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. So I would like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Jaye for any additional concluding comments.","Jim Jaye","Thank you Jessie and thanks everybody for participating in our call today. I appreciate your continued interest in Sherwin. I will be available for calls the rest of the week as well my colleague, Eric Swanson. Please contact Natalie Darr to get yourself in the queue. And thank you again. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time."],"18787":["The Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) Q4 2013 Earnings Call January 30, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Robert J.

In order to allow more time for questions, we've provided balance sheet items and other statistical data on our website at sherwin.com, under Investor Relations 2013 Year End Press Release.","Summarizing overall company performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2013, consolidated sales for the fourth quarter increased 10.6% to $2.46 billion, due primarily to higher paint sales volume to our Paint Stores Group and acquisitions. For the full year, sales increased 6.8% to $10.19 billion. Sales from acquisitions increased consolidated net sales approximately 4.6% in the quarter and 1.8% in the full year. Currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 1.1% in the quarter and 0.8% for the full year. Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter increased to 45.8% of sales from 44.8% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase in gross margin in the quarter was primarily due to improved fixed cost absorption from increased sales volumes, partially offset by lower gross margin sales by the U.S. and Canadian stores acquired from Comex.","For the year, gross margin increased to 45.3% of sales from 44.1% last year. The increase in gross margin for the year was primarily due to increased production volumes, partially offset by import duty assessments related to our Brazilian operation and dilution from acquisitions.","Selling, general and administrative expense in dollars increased $70.2 million in the fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter last year, but decreased, as a percent of sales, to 39.2% from 40.1% in the same quarter last year. For the full year 2013, SG&A expense increased $208 million to $3.47 billion but decreased, as a percent of sales, to 34% from 34.2% in 2012. The incremental SG&A from acquisitions, new stores and customer service investments accounted for the majority of SG&A increase in the year.","Interest expense for the quarter increased $5.1 million to $16.9 million. For the year, interest expense was $62.7 million compared to $42.8 million in 2012. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2013 decreased to 22.2% from 27.8% in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the year, our effective tax rate was 30.7% compared to 30.4% in 2012. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and full year was favorably impacted by the integration of Comex stores. The effective tax rate for the quarter and year without Comex would have been 32.3% and 32.1%, respectively.","Consolidated net income for the quarter increased $48.1 million to $116.1 million. For the year, net income increased $121.5 million to $752.6 million. Net income as a percent of sales in the quarter increased to 4.7% from 3.1% last year. And for the year, net income as a percent of sales increased to 7.4% from 6.6% in 2012. Diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter 2013 increased to $1.14 per share from $0.65 per share in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, diluted net income per common share increased 20.6% to $7.26 per share from $6.02 per share in 2012.","Now I'd like to review our performance by segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter increased 17.6% to $1.46 billion. For the year, net sales increased 10.9% to $6 billion. Sales increases in the quarter and year resulted from higher paint sales volume across all customer segments and acquisitions. Acquisitions increased net sales for the segment 7.5% in the quarter and 2.2% for the full year. Comparable store sales increased 9.2% in the quarter and 7.8% in the year. Regionally, in the fourth quarter, our Southeast division led all divisions followed by Midwest division, Southwest division and Eastern division. Fourth quarter segment profit for the Paint Stores Group decreased to $168.5 million from $181.5 million in the fourth quarter last year, due primarily to a loss from acquisitions, partially offset by higher year-over-year paint sales volumes. Acquisitions reduced segment profit $40.4 million in the quarter. For full year, Paint Stores Group profit increased 14.9% to $990.5 million from $861.8 million in 2012. The increase in segment profit for the quarter and year resulted from higher paint sales volumes that were partially offset by higher SG&A expense and a loss from acquisitions. Acquisitions reduced full year segment profit $43.1 million.","Segment profit margin for the fourth quarter decreased to 11.5% from 14.6% last year. Profit margin for the full year 2013 increased to 16.5% from 15.9% in 2012.","Turning now to our Consumer Group. Fourth quarter external net sales increased 6.6% to $272.6 million, due primarily to higher volume sales to most of the group's retail customers and to acquisitions. For the year, Consumer Group sales increased 1.5% to $1.34 billion as a result of acquisitions, which more than offset the previously disclosed reduction in business with a large retail customer. Acquisitions increased net sales by 1.3% in the quarter and by 2.4% in the year. Segment profit for the fourth quarter increased to $36 million from $23.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the year, segment profit increased 11.9% to $242.1 million from $216.4 million in 2012. In both the quarter and full year, segment profit increased due primarily to higher sales volume and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by dilution from acquisitions. Acquisitions reduced segment profit $2.3 million in the fourth quarter and $0.5 million in the full year.","Consumer Group segment profit as a percent of net sales in the fourth quarter increased to 13.2% from 9.1% last year. For the year, segment profit margin increased to 18% from 16.4% in 2012.","For our Global Finishes Group, fourth quarter net sales increased 2% to $496.9 million, and full year sales increased 2.2% to $2 billion, due primarily to selling price increases and acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Acquisitions increased the group sales in U.S. dollars by 1.1% in the quarter and 1.2% in the year. Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 0.2% in the quarter and decreased sales by 0.4% in the year. Global Finishes Group segment profit in the fourth quarter increased to $37.7 million from $34.1 million last year. For the year, segment profit increased to $170.6 million from $147.2 million last year.","In the quarter and the year, segment profit improvement resulted from increasing operating efficiencies and higher year-over-year selling prices. Unfavorable currency translation and acquisitions reduced segment profit $400,000 in the quarter and $500,000 in the year. As a percent of net sales, Global Finishes Group operating profit was 7.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 7% last year and 8.5% for the year compared to 7.5% last year.","For our Latin America Coatings Group, net sales decreased 4% to $222.2 million in the fourth quarter and decreased 0.4% to $832.5 million for the full year due primarily to unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by higher year-over-year selling prices.","Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 9.4% in the quarter and 7.1% in the year.","Stated in U.S. dollars, Latin America Coatings Group segment profit in the quarter decreased to $17.9 million from $30.1 million last year, due primarily to lower volume sales and unfavorable currency translation. For the year, segment profit decreased to $38.6 million from $81.2 million in 2012.","Brazil tax assessments in the second and third quarters totaling $31.6 million accounted for most of the reduction in segment profit in the year. Unfavorable currency also contributed to full year profit shortfall. Currency translation decreased segment profit $3.7 million in the quarter and decreased profit $5.5 million in the year. As a percent of net sales, segment profit was 8.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 13% last year and 4.6% for the year compared to 9.7% in 2012.","I'll conclude this review with a brief update on the status of our Lead Pigment Litigation. In the Santa Clara County case involving public nuisance claims brought by 10 California cities and counties against 5 defendant companies, Judge Kleinberg filed his final statement of decision on January 7, 2014. The decision orders 3 of the defendants, Sherwin-Williams, NL Industries and ConAgra, to pay $1.15 billion into a fund to be administered by the Childhood Lead Prevention program branch, a state agency that already receives funding from fees paid by major oil producers and paint companies. The 10 plaintiff jurisdictions must apply for grants from this fund to use on lead education, testing or abatement programs. Each jurisdiction has a maximum amount of money that they can use from this fund based on the number of pre-1980 homes in the jurisdiction. The ruling only applies to interior paint but does include encapsulation of some outside soil around homes. The plan is voluntary for homeowners and will be administered on a worst-go-first basis. Any money left in the fund after 4 years reverts to the defendants.","Final judgment was entered on January 27th. From this final judgment, we will file post-trial motions and our notice of appeal. We expect to file our appeal to the 6th District Court of Appeals within the next 60 days and believe the process is likely to take 2 to 3 years.","There was also a recent development in the Bank's case, which is a lead pigment case pending in Mississippi, involving claims by 5 individuals for lead poisoning allegedly to have occurred while they were children at a head start facility. The plaintiffs in this case alleged that Sherwin-Williams supplied paint containing lead to the facility for use on playground equipment. The trial court originally granted Sherwin-Williams summary judgment based on a lack of product identification. On January 16th of this year, the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed the lower court's dismissal, sending the case back to trial court for further proceedings. Additional discovery and subsequent motions for summary judgment are expected and no timetable has been established for further proceedings.","That concludes my review of our results for fourth quarter and full year 2013, so I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2014. Chris?","Christopher M. Connor","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. The financial results in the press release we issued this morning, as well as the numbers that Bob just walked you through, adhere to generally accepted accounting principles for financial reporting. That's the standard we prefer to follow because it's the most consistent and appropriate way to present our results. Although we don't use non-GAAP or pro forma or adjusted financial metrics in our earnings releases, in some cases, you can get a clear picture of how the core business perform by backing out the extraordinary items. The past 2 years are good examples. If you strip away the impact from acquisitions, tax assessments, Department of Label settlement and various other one-time items we incurred over the past 2 years, so we're comparing apples-to-apples, our core consolidated sales increased 5% in 2013 and our core earnings per share increased more than 17% or $6.49 per share to $7.60. This approach also helps to highlight the earnings leverage in our operating segments.","For example, backing up the acquisitions from our Paint Stores Group, organic revenue growth for the year was just under 9% and flow-through on operating profit was more than 36%. On a GAAP basis, both Paint Stores Group and Consumer Group established new high watermarks for full year operating margins.","Paint Stores' operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 16.5% and consumer segment operating margin increased to 18% from 16.4% last year. Global Finishes Group operating margin also improved 100 basis points year-over-year while the economic challenges and currency headwinds Bob discussed were too much for our Latin American coating segment to overcome. Although we anticipate further dilution from acquisition and integration this year, we also expect continued strong earnings leverage on organic revenue growth.","We achieved 2 significant revenue milestones in 2013. Consolidated net sales for the company eclipsed $10 billion and our Paint Stores Group surpassed $6 billion in sales. Based on the midpoint of our sales guidance range for 2014 we'll add more than $1 billion in consolidated revenue this year, the majority of which will come from organic growth.","For the first time in our history, net operating cash exceeded $1 billion, finishing the year at $1.1 billion, which is at 10.6% of sales. A portion of this increase came from our continued progress of reducing working capital requirements. Our working capital ratio was 10.5% of sales at year end compared to 10.8% of sales at the end of 2012. Once again, if you back up the effect of acquisitions, year-end working capital ratio would have been 10.0%, and that would have been an all-time low for the company.","In 2013, our Paint Stores Group opened 82 net new stores and acquired an additional 306 locations under the Frazee, Parker, General, Kwal and ColorWheel brands, a total of 388 new locations. The integration of these stores and facilities in our existing operations is proceeding on schedule. We are delighted to welcome these outstanding men and women to our company and add these well-respected brands and products to our portfolio. At year end, our store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean was 3,908 locations.","In 2014, we intend to ramp up our new store openings to a range of 80 to 90 additional locations. During the past year, we hired 1,400 new college graduates into our respective management training program to bolster our store staffing, improve our territory coverage and fill our store management pipeline. Although these investments tend to drive SG&A higher in the back half of the year, new stores and service employees pay for themselves over a very short period of time. At year end, our total debt was $1.72 billion and cash on hand was $745 million. We continue to manage our balance sheet in anticipation of closing the Mexican portion of the Comex transaction.","During the year, we returned more than 90% of the net operating cash we've generated, $974 million to be exact, to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 1.5 million shares of the company's stock for treasury, bringing our full year total to 4.3 million shares, an average cost of $178.90 per share and a total investment of $769 million. At year end, we have remaining authorization to acquire another 12.15 million shares.","We paid $205 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends. 2013 marked our 35th consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a string we intend to continue. This year, at our upcoming February meeting of the Board of Directors, we will recommend approval of a payout rate for 2014 consistent with our policy of 30% of prior year's earnings per share resulting in an annual dividend of approximately $2.20 per share, an increase of $0.10 -- 10% over 2013.","We begin each year with some level of uncertainty, and 2014 is no exception. Data on the U.S. housing market had been mixed in recent months but we remain bullish based on current volume trends and feedback from many of our customers. Likewise, recovery in the domestic nonresidential construction market has been slow, but we have seen some improvement in our sales to this segment, nonetheless. We expect this positive momentum in this market segment to continue as well in 2014.","Outside the U.S., it appears likely that sluggish market conditions and currency devaluation in many Latin American countries will remain a challenge. Modestly improving economic growth in Europe may provide some offset. Our raw material basket has many moving parts as well but in total, we believe there's some risk of modest inflation. Propylene, a key raw material feedstock, has increased in successive months to $0.73 per pound today from the low $0.60 per pound range a year ago. This will keep upward pressure on the price of monomers and latex in the first half of 2014. Increases in the price of high-density polyethylene will affect the cost of plastic pails. High-grade chloride titanium dioxide pricing held steady over the back half of 2013, but higher order volumes and lower inventories are driving factory utilization rates up, which could result in some pricing traction by mid year. Based on all of these factors, we would expect average year-over-year raw material cost inflation for the paint and coatings industry to be in the low single-digit range in 2014.","With these factors in mind, our outlook for the first quarter of 2014 is for consolidated net sales to increase 7% to 12% compared to last year's first quarter. With sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter will be in the range of $0.95 to $1.15 per share compared to a $1.11 per share earned in the first quarter of 2013. Embedded in this guidance is our expectation that Comex stores in the U.S. and Canada will add approximately $97 million to $107 million to net sales, and reduce diluted net income per common share $0.15 to $0.25 per share in the quarter.","For the full year 2014, we expect net sales will increase by 8% to 13% compared to full year 2013. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2014 will be in the range of $8.12 to $8.32 per share compared to $7.26 in 2013. This guidance anticipates that Comex stores in the U.S. and Canada will increase net sales by a low single-digit percentage in the year and reduce earnings per share in the range of $0.45 to $0.55 per share for the full year of 2014.","Again, we'd like to thank all of you for joining us this morning and we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is -- comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Chris, you mentioned the sort of upper single-digit, low double-digit revenue base and also some raw material inflation. Can you give us a sense of what pricing might do in 2014?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, we can. In fact, we have announced some pricing to our stores, that's what we typically comment on. But we want to give you a little different feel for that this year. And Sean, maybe you can take the guide through that.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, this is Sean Hennessy. And as you mentioned in the past, we've been able to tell you when and how much selling price increases we have taken to the market. Due to the integration of the 5 brands acquired through the Comex, there are inconsistencies in when those things will occur, that do not really -- do not allow us to answer the question on pricing the same way as we have in the past. Our margin will be affected by the selling price increase that Chris just talked about and stores did go out in early January with some pricing. But the annualization of Comex, the foreign currency fluctuations, raw material changes that are going on, what we've thought of in the past, we've only given guidance on the annual basis looking at the sales and to the EPS. And just to give you some clarity on what's going to happen with pricing and how all this affects us is really to give you a gross margin range. Our gross margins will increase this year but we still believe we're in that 43% to 46% range. And this should tell you that we believe our total gross margin will be in the 45.5% to 46% range versus the 45.3% that we realized in the full year 2013.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to clarify on the comment that Chris made first. The 36% incremental margins in Paint Stores excluding the acquisitions, did I hear that right?","Christopher M. Connor","That's correct.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, very good. And then if you look at the $40.4 million of loss from the acquisition in that segment, can you break that down a little bit? How much was underlying business? How much was kind of inventory onetime step up or costs on the integration? I guess I'm just trying to get a sense, what was kind of the run rate of the business? I think we've talked about close to breakeven as it was coming into the portfolio, but just trying to understand the health of the businesses underlying that number?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, and a couple of things there -- again, this is Sean Hennessy, when you take a look at the sales curve that they have, they have a sales curve much like the Paint Stores Group for the second and third quarter, the highest sales quarters. So when you talk about annual might be flat but really when the fourth quarter is our toughest quarter because of the sales curve. When you look at that $40 million, approximately half of that was operating income, normal operating income. The other half was really onetime causes, inventory step up, other causes of expense that you mentioned. So that was about half and half, almost half and half is exactly. And just to remind you, when you look at that, as well as we're talking about that, that $40 million hit, we also mentioned that Comex was $0.13 dilutive for the year. And if you think where that $40 million segment was in the operating profit, the net effect from Comex was positively affected by tax savings and those tax savings were due to the integration of contingent liabilities. That integration was a positive $0.15 per share. And so when you -- and really, it really dealt a lot with the defined benefit plan. Our tax rate was 30.7% for the year that we reported. It would have been 32.1% really without that Comex and without that balance sheet integration. And our fourth quarter tax rate was 22.2%. It would have been 32.3% without the Comex. So in a way, that 40, that converts down to the $0.13. When you look at Chris' comments, that 45 to 50, mid point there is 50. There it is, $0.63. And I know last quarter, we've talked about the $0.60 to $0.65 dilution. We did give you 20 -- that $0.40 in the fourth quarter and we just experienced $0.11, but that $0.15 tax savings, actually it was -- we were not expecting to get that in the fourth quarter. So we actually were expecting to get that in the calendar year 2014. But we were able to accelerate that with the combination of defined benefit plan so it works out pretty well.","Operator","The next question is coming in the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Sean, maybe you could just expand on the continued liability tax savings. Is there any flow-through whatsoever into 2014 or was that all netted out in 4Q?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, we ended up -- we were able to get 100% of it in the fourth quarter, so that was nice.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just on Latin America, can you just give us a more granular picture as it relates to the major countries there? Is the weakness broad-based, any impact on inflation from the currency devaluations in certain countries there?","Christopher M. Connor","Sure, Ghansham. As we've commented in the past, Brazil is the second largest country of revenue for the corporation, Mexico would be third. And those happen to be the 2 economies that were probably hit the most. When we look at local currency performance for the business, our sales were up modestly. We held serve, I guess, is a good way to take a look at that as we went through the year. We are not expecting to see a lot of turnaround in Brazil going forward and I think we still have these currency devaluations. So Latin America has been the cycle for us. We've had a solid 10-year run down there where we had relatively flat currency and we're able to make some good inroads and we're kind of going through the other side of that right now. Our expectations, as we gave guidance, was that it wouldn't be a real help to the company next year.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And Chris, just to clarify that, on Brazil, specifically, does this sort of paradigm right now just affect your organic growth initiatives down there?","Christopher M. Connor","Not so much. I mean, those are long-term plans that we have in place. So as you know, we are continuing to open our own dedicated company facilities, primarily in the northeastern part of the country. We continue to support our dealer network and convert to a more dedicated dealer format. So we haven't pulled back. We rarely do in a downturn. We keep pushing forward.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You talked about or you can deduce from the press release that the revenues in Comex in the quarter were about $100 million. Order of magnitude, what are they in a seasonally strong quarter?","Christopher M. Connor","I think when we've talked about this acquisition, we had told you that, at one point in time, when the entirety of the acquisition was being discussed, it's about a $1.5 billion transaction for the company. We said 1\/3 of that was approximately in the United States, so $500 million for ease of math. So $100 million fourth quarter. And back to Sean's comment about the second and third quarters drive it. We just gave guidance that the first quarter for Comex revenue would be, again, about $100 million in the midpoint of that, so that all seems to kind of fit and tick and tie together, Jeff.","Sean P. Hennessy","So you're looking at about 20% in the fourth and third -- I'm sorry, the first -- 20% in the fourth and the first, 30% in the second and third.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, good. And then for my follow-up. Pretty much every year propylene goes up in the first quarter of the year and then comes back down because refineries turn around and so do ethylene crackers. So do you normally have some rise in your raw materials, in your propylene-based raw materials, in the first quarter and then they come off in the course of the year? Or now that the acrylics industry structure is a little bit tighter, do they tend to stay a little bit higher? Sort of can you discuss the progression of the normal propylene-based raw materials?","Robert J. Wells","Yes, Jeff, this is Bob. We've said in the past that, typically, it takes between 90 and 120 days for an increase in propylene to flow-through the acrylic chain and that's still the case. So I guess that would be saying, if propylene does follow its normal course and comes down after first quarter, it's likely we aren't going to see a lot of upward pressure in the acrylics and the solvents. But if it were to stay in the low to mid $0.70 per pound range, we'd likely see some modest upward pressure, primarily in acrylics in the middle part of the year.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC","Couple of things, one, I'm hoping you can clarify on the U.S. in terms of the bid process to get a proxy for your backlog, how things are looking there? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Robert J. Wells","Yes, I think that when you -- when we look at the activity, that bidding activity, we feel pretty good about it. I think it -- occasionally, you'll see some weather affecting daily sales. But when you look at the demand, we feel pretty good about what's happening in America, in the United States.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC","In terms of size of job as well, any sense of whether that's coming from non-res or res or can you tell?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think it's been pretty consistent, Aram, about the segments that we've commented on. Residential repaint has been terrific. And new residential construction, we've commented on that as well. Property management's doing well, given the rebound in the multifamily housing. So all those segments are doing well. We're not the kind of company that has a backlog or we see forward orders, I mean, painting contractors walk in that morning, we put paint in their truck and they walk out and get the job done. So to Sean's point, just kind of the flow and the rhythm and the feel of the business is very consistent with the guidance we've given.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And 2 quick housekeeping things, can you give us a sense as to what share count you've got assumed in that EPS guidance for '14? And also, Bob or Sean, if you know, often times, at the end of the year, you do a physical inventory adjustment and call that out in the K. I didn't know if that figure was available for us.","Sean P. Hennessy","As in the past, when you take a look at guidance and you look at it, we do have share buyback in our guidance, not really going to share that number, but we don't -- as we said earlier, we don't usually go down the P&L. But we do have some stock buybacks, we have uses of cash. On the other number for that adjustment, we don't have it right now in the physical inventory. I know it's going to be in the K, I just don't have it here in the room with me, sorry. And one more note on share count. We ended the year with actual shares outstanding of 100,129,380, so that's the starting point.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A quick question on the commercial market. Can you talk about what kind of contract or project backlog are you seeing for this spring and how does that compare with last year?","Robert J. Wells","Yes, I wouldn't describe the -- this is Bob again, I would not describe the commercial market right now, at this point, as being significantly backlogged. We are seeing a modest pickup in starts in the back half of 2013, which should translate to more paint projects by the back half of 2014. That would be in the mid to high single-digit range. So that the rebound in commercial construction has been slow to start, we are seeing a little bit of momentum building. I think the forecast for starts in 2014 are healthier than 2013, high single-digits. Some people are even going out on a limb with low teens numbers. But I think the good news in this is we're seeing more activity in the repaint market, which implies higher occupancy rates in office, retail and lodging and that should ultimately translate to higher square footage. As a reminder, commercial construction volume is still in the trough, so we've got a long ways to come back.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And secondly on TiO2. I think, Chris, you mentioned that producer inventories have come down. So as you get ready for the spring season, how do your inventories of TiO2 look like? And also you've been cautious on buying Chinese TiO2 in the past. Where do you stand on that?","Christopher M. Connor","In terms of our TiO2 inventory, they remain extremely steady and in line with our kind of production processes throughout the course of the year. We take the vast majority of this product in the United States in a slurry form. It's not the kind of thing that we can load up on excess inventory and sit on it. So we are at a pretty much a steady-state consistent inventory level based on the demand of production that we put on our factories. We have been increasing our purchases of some offshore titanium, mostly in the sulfite grade. We see more of that emerging in our Latin American operations. I think we've commented in the past that, at some point in time, perhaps 5% of our needs could be moved to that type and we're seeing some progress towards that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm trying to understand, if you guys are including higher gross margins in your guidance, it seems like to get to your -- to the guidance, you'd have to assume some pretty sharp increases in SG&A or other costs in excess of what you've outlined for Comex. So, is that -- is there some reason why that's happening? Or any color that could help us understand the SG&A ramp I think would be helpful.","Sean P. Hennessy","I think we're continually -- we've continued to invest in the business, invest in new stores. I think we're going to open more stores in 2014 than in 2013. So the people and the reps and the infrastructure there, I think, that we're adding to that, that's going to increase the SG&A. And I think that we've continued to, on the admin side, continue to invest in IT projects that have allowed us to get our working capital down to an all-time low of net 10% and allowed the cash to go back over 10% of sales. And think that those things are good investments that we're spending in SG&A that are creating cash. And so, yes, we're investing in this business but I think the number one reason we're going to have SG&A growth next year is going to be the Comex acquisition. And then secondly is the continuing building out of the store chain in our stores group.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Is there a significant amount of expenses related to Comex Mexico and your efforts there and maybe you could highlight that as well?","Sean P. Hennessy","No. I think we've been pretty prudent there. We do have ongoing expenses but I wouldn't call them material on our SG&A base.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then finally, as a follow-up or housekeeping, if you guys could give the change in gross profit by segment?","Sean P. Hennessy","Sure. Okay. And -- for the quarter? Gross profit...","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, that would be great.","Sean P. Hennessy","Consolidated was $128.7 million, as you know, Paint Stores Group was $80.9 million; Consumer Group, $27.4 million; Global Finishes, $8.6 million; and Latin America, $6.4 million. So I'll just give you the year-to-date so you don't have to do the addition there. The full year 2013 consolidated, $410.3 million; Stores Group, $330.9 million; Consumer Group, $47.4 million; Global Finishes, $43.6 million; and Latin America was actually negative $28.8 million.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Just, Sean, on the SG&A question again, in the past, you've always invested in the business and even have been proactive about investing ahead of revenue and I think that was the case in '13 as well. But you've also been able to leverage SG&A versus revenue. So from a relative standpoint, is your expectation of SG&A is going up even -- maybe even talking about it with or without Comex?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I think that when we look at the 2013, back to your point, and I'm just looking at this -- 2012, our SG&A was 34.2%. Without Comex this year, we would have shown improvement on that. And next year, we're still going to show -- we'll show improvement on the core SG&A. And I'm trying to look at the metric that I can give you, but no, I think the core SG&A will improve.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And with Comex, it would be up, in terms of revenue?","Sean P. Hennessy","When you take a look at it, yes, it's going to be close to up. It's going to be in that ballpark, it's not -- for the full year.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then, Chris, I guess there's probably nothing specific you can share on Comex Mexico, but any update on timing at least, of news flow?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, we'd be happy to comment on Comex Mexico, we've continued to work on that. And Sean, maybe you can take the team through that.","Sean P. Hennessy","We continue to believe -- at the very beginning, I'd like to say, we still believe this is going to be a very good acquisition for the company. We'll continue to work on a process that would allow us to close this acquisition. This process required us signing nondisclosure agreements with outside parties, which limits what we can say, but what we will say is we have an exclusive contract with the Achar family through March 31, 2014. We have crafted our final remedy and are prepared to present to the proper authorities. We have not received a firm date of that presentation but fully expect it to occur in February, with a response from the commission sometime after that but close to the March 31 date.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And is it your expectation of that decision would then be final one way or another?","Sean P. Hennessy","That's why we used the word final remedy. I think that this is our final bite of the apple.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sean, just a clarification on the tax rate given the Comex U.S. and Canadian distortions, what is the tax rate that you've embedded in your earnings guidance for 2014 or range of tax rates?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. We don't go down -- again, we try not to go down the whole frame, because there some -- we don't have 1 range, we have multiple scenarios to get into a range. But if you take a look at year-to-date without the Comex, it would have been in that 32.3% range. We've all constantly talking about that low 33%s. And I think that you go back the last 5 years, I think it's been in that low 33% type of range.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then second question for Chris, if I may, I heard your comments regarding the California litigation or, I guess, Bob's comments here and the appeals associated with that. How should we be thinking about funding of the $1.15 billion in terms of how it could possibly be split among the defendants and timing? And separate question, do you have any other avenues of recourse beyond the appeals process factoring property owners, for example?","Robert J. Wells","Kevin, it's Bob. On the first part of the question, the decision by the judge, the remedy is joint and several -- is a joint and several liability. So it means that all 3 defendants are essentially equally responsible for the entire remedy. He has given no indication how he intends to apportion the remedy across 3 defendants. It's also our position that it's kind of a moot issue at this stage in the game because we don't believe we'll have to pay any money prior to the appeal process. This is a mandatory injunction, which we do not believe should require any appeal bond or anything of that nature. As far as future actions with respect to factoring homeowners or anything like that, we're not prepared to go into that at this point.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","It looks like incremental margins in your Paint Stores Group declined pretty sharply on a sequential basis and year-over-year when you remove Comex. Is there any seasonality in this or is there something unique, just trying to get more color on what drove the decline in incremental margins.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I don't know what number you're using for Comex margins but even with that, the fourth quarter is always interesting because of LIFO, the physical inventory adjustments that we spoke about before, so a couple of years ago, we were talking about this. 2009, our gross margin actually was 48.5% in the quarter because of some of these things that have occurred. So there's different things that go on between 1 fourth quarter to another. Fourth quarter is the toughest to look at. I think to try to read, to try to project anything in the future.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Got it. And just as a follow-up, I think at one time, estimates, the Sherwin's estimate, at least, for total gallons in the U.S. was somewhere in the line of 630 million to 640 million in 2012. Do you have an estimate or do you have an update for what you think it may have been in 2013?","Robert J. Wells","Nils, this is Bob. We think the market in 2013 probably grew in the 4% to 5%, maybe 5.5% range. And we base that just by looking at various public statements and public releases across the population of publicly traded companies that do significant architectural business in the U.S.. That feels about right to us.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could you give us a timeframe for getting the U.S. and Canada Comex stores to the average Sherwin-Williams margins? And given the potential here that you might have to divest the wholly-owned Mexican Sherwin-Williams operations, I don't know, whether the nondisclosure will allow you to at least range that -- or size it for us? And is it above or below the average paint store margins?","Robert J. Wells","Just so you know, first, Mexico stores that you're referred to, our operations are in the LACG segment, they're not in the store segment. Just want to make sure that's clear. On the first question of what we've said is, again, that $0.60 to $0.65, and what we've said is in 2015, in the annual 2015, we think that the Comex stores will run at the 70% to 80% of where Paint Stores Group is at. And then after that, it will start to continue to improve from there. And the Comex -- and the Mexican assets, we're really, again, we're little -- we're under secrecy with the nondisclosure, we really don't want to express what the remedy may or may not be and then also not going to give metrics to any possible remedy. I think what's better course for us is that if we get approval, we'll disclose all of those type of things to you. And if we don't get approval, we probably won't, that's for sure. The remedy will never be public.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of John McNulty of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two quick points or questions. On the $0.45 to $0.55 hit that you expect in 2014 from Comex, in that, can you give us some color as to how much of that is going to be onetime or kind of structurally working to fit the asset in versus kind of just the normal run rate for that business?","Robert J. Wells","Yes, I think that 60% will be onetime hits and it will be in that range.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So that business is then running at a loss kind of -- or in your mind, for 2014, is going to run at a loss the whole year?","Robert J. Wells","Right. Because what happens is, when you -- let's say, you're going to -- you're living in the short term with the additional cost of, possibly, some plants and distribution centers, those were considering part, until we close them and taking the hit, we consider that part of the ongoing op. And that's where you start saying, which bucket do you put it in. But if you close the plant in September, at the end of September, then the first 9 months go into your first bucket of the operating margin and then the hit of closing plant goes into the extraordinary. That answer would tell you that if we run that plant for 9 months, that's in the normal, not in the extraordinary.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. Fair enough. And just then just one follow-up question. If we back out Comex in terms of kind of what it did in the fourth quarter and then also kind of how it's going to impact 2014, it looks like you're guiding to 5% to 10% top line growth, which normally, based on kind of what Chris had talked about earlier in terms of leverage, tax, what have you, should get you $1.25 to almost $2.25 of incremental EPS and that -- but your guidance really doesn't imply that when you kind of look at your core non-Comex-related business, it looks like it's at the very low-end or even sub that. So, I guess, what's driving that, what's driving that level of conservatism in your kind of core platform?","Robert J. Wells","I will tell you this. I would just say, if you take a look at the core, I don't think that a 5% gain has ever given us $2.25 EPS growth in a year. And so when you look at the number that Chris gave you, the $7.60 versus the $6.49, it's $1.11. And so when you sit there and look at that $7.60, and I'm just going to add back the midpoint, that's is -- use the midpoint, $8.22 and $0.50 of Comex, that takes you up to $8.72 from $7.60, that's $1.12 when you take a look at that, so I think that's pretty comparable. And I do think that, in general, I think that things are going pretty well. I think $1.11 on top of $1.12 last year, $1.12 versus $1.11 are pretty comparable. And when you look at that sales gain, just like this year, we think that currency is still going to be a headwind and some of these countries are still going to have some problems.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with Keybanc Capital Markets.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions are answered. I just have a quick one. In the Global Group, continuing to be fairly -- consolidation continues to move on. Is there any opportunity for you to consolidate that market further? And then if you look at your European businesses, I know that they're small, relative, but have you seen any stabilization to improvement going forward?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Ivan, we have talked for a while with The Street about our strategy here. We like these businesses. We would look for opportunities to invest appropriately were there opportunities to present themselves, we won't comment on any of that, perspectively. Europe had a good year for our Global Finishes business. We're seeing some nice progress over there from the teams that we've put on the ground. We expect Europe to continue to have profitable sales going forward.","Robert J. Wells","And on your first question, our operating profit in 2012 was 7.5%. This year, it was 8.5%. So nice 1% gain on the ROF. And as we've talked in the past, we still think we can drive that to 12%, so we think there's still big improvement in the future.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A couple of questions. First of all, to follow-up on the last question. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your Global Group businesses in terms of auto collision and industrial markets. You mentioned that Europe was strong for your wood coatings business, but can you talk about the other portions of Global?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, so I think all 3 of these businesses ran pretty much at the same level. You can see that the sales results here were below the company's consolidated numbers. So a relatively soft sales year. We've commented about soft economic environment, some of the end markets that we sell products into are a little soft as well. I think that when we take the market performance itself into consideration, not concerned that we're losing share here, but not exactly lighting it up either. Going forward, we're pretty excited about the winter we're having across the United States. Automotive runs on collision repair business and so that should be a little bit of a tailwind for that team going into this year and I think we've had some nice wins on various accounts around the world in our product finishes businesses. We'd expect them to have a little better year going forward next year as well. So beyond that, Dmitry, not a lot more to comment on.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, that's helpful. If you look at the Consumer Group, it really had a nice turnaround as the year progressed. It sort of started the year weakly and you have some losses of a business, and then it seemed to well turned around by the end of the year. Can you talk a little bit about sort of what you guys done to get that ship moving in the right direction and also what's your outlook for the consumer is for 2014 both in terms of, not maybe the top line, directionally and perhaps margin expectations.","Christopher M. Connor","So I'll take the business and the sales, and we'll Sean comment on margin expectations for Consumer Group. You're right, the fourth quarter was terrific. One of the best quarters we've seen in sometime. And it was pretty broad-based across the entire customer segment. The product lines, as you know, in our consumer business, we have architectural paint, but we also have aerosols and brushes and rollers, caulks and sealants, stains, water protecting products and pretty much, across the board, all those business were going in a good direction. I don't think that the fourth quarter is the precursor of things to come. We've been consistent with our guidance that this is a low single-digit kind of growing business for the company, I don't think we're expecting that we've reached a new kind of a plateau, we're going to run at this level going forward. But it was encouraging to see and I think one of our executives made a comment that when we get good quarters in consumer, we'll take them, we're glad for them. Our expectations are that most of the headwinds that we've had here that have been kind of event driven, lost the big accounts, et cetera, have all anniversary-ed, they're all behind us. So 2014, knock on wood, might be one of those years that's a pretty normalized year and give us a sense of how the business can actually run. Sean, you want to comment a little bit on our margin expectations here?","Sean P. Hennessy","Sure. Over the years, we've continued to talk about that consumer can have -- their operating margins can be higher than stores, but it's going to be more volatile. And so when we get volume through and what's nice is there was volumes, for the last couple of years, we've had volume only going through from the stores group, as Chris talked about, the struggles on the external sales. But when you get external sales like we have, as well as the internal sales going through there, consumer can really produce nicely for us. And that's why we've always thought that the margins can be higher there, but because of the choppiness of demand, especially on the external side, you're going to see it much more volatile. So last year, we hit 18%, I think that it's a well-managed division that we've given some assets from the Comex grouping to them. I think that they'll do a great job with those assets and I think that in the end, you'll see margins higher than this. I can't remember when stores groups' highest margin was 14.4%. And someone said, \"Well, are you ever going to beat that?\" We've beat it a few times now, the last 2 years actually. And I think our Consumer Group, we expect to go higher with some of these assets and add a little more volume.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. And just a couple of bookkeeping questions. What's your CapEx and G&A expectations for 2014?","Sean P. Hennessy","I think our CapEx is going to be somewhere in the $180 million to $200 million range. And as we bring in some -- do some of these work and move some production around. And our G&A should be in the $35 million range, up from around $29 million to $30 million they had this year. And use those numbers, they're not going to be materially off.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Bob, I wanted to follow-up on your growth outlook for U.S. architecture. You talked about 5%, 5.5% growth in calendar '13, with the pickup in commercial or nonresidential construction this year. Would you expect that to accelerate? And then the follow-on to that is Paint Stores grew at almost 8% versus 5% market growth and, obviously, nonres is even higher proportion of contractor business, so would you expect your Paint Stores Group sales to -- on a same-store sales basis, to outpace the market growth even further in 2014?","Robert J. Wells","Don, on the first part of the question, if the rate of housing starts holds up and that would be a 10% to 15% increase year-over-year in the rate of housing starts, and we see this high single digit acceleration in nonresidential starts, with a commensurate amount of nonresidential maintenance and -- property maintenance activity, it would be very easily -- easy to duplicate mid single-digit industry growth rate in 2014. We have long said that our expectation for our Paint Stores Group is for growth in the range of 1.5x to 2x market rate. And we think, in that environment, that's probably doable as well.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Gregg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The half of the $40 million of loss that you had in the quarter from the acquisitions, the half that was impairment, did that show up in the gross margin or SG&A?","Sean P. Hennessy","I would tell you probably 65%, 70% went in to gross margin and the remainder went to SG&A.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then the second question was on the pricing. I recognized it's difficult given Comex having a different mix. But if you could just look at the old Paint Stores Group, what do you think the pricing is?","Robert J. Wells","Yes, I think, that again, because as time goes on, there's customers that are going to go from the old to the new, the Comex stores. And I think that any metric we give you might give you a wrong indication, Greg. And that's what we're trying to walk away from this, this quarter. We might -- a year from now, we might come back to the old way but right now, we're -- with people going from 1 store to another, it's -- any metric might give you the wrong indication.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I understand. But so to maybe to get to the -- another angle about gross margin, it looks like gross margins, if you back out the DOJ settlement, where, really, you only have 20 or 30 bps. I guess, why did the GM gains decelerate so much in the fourth quarter? Is there something else that going on that we need to be...","Robert J. Wells","No. I think that -- I think it was the Comex. If you take a look at that piece that went through, that onetime hit that went through gross margins that we just -- I just gave you, I think should give you a pretty good idea that, really, gross margins didn't decelerate.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's the 65%.","Robert J. Wells","Yes.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Start it off with Sean, I think around the time you announced the Comex acquisition, I had asked about using the financing that you had instituted for repo if the deal didn't get done, is that still your feeling?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. But you can probably tell that we're close to having a final answer in this, so we still have that cash on our balance sheet. But if not, we'll end up buying back stock.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Okay. And then that 36% incremental margin, I don't understand quite how you got to that. But I do see if I back out the Comex impact on the paint stores in the quarter, the segment got about a 16.6% margin, can you sort of connect the dots there, Sean, between those 2 figures?","Sean P. Hennessy","Chuck, do you have one other question, I'll pull out that piece of paper.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","All right. And then the other question would be if you look at the approximately $20 million hit from Comex in the fourth quarter due to onetime items and once your forecasting for Comex's hit in the first quarter, it looks like you're going to be spending more on onetime items, perhaps. And that the operations should already be showing improvement in the fourth -- in the first quarter of 2014, is that a correct conclusion to draw?","Sean P. Hennessy","Again, that's why we put a little bit wider range on here, it really depends on when we take some of these closing costs, Chuck. But the first quarter should be fairly consistent with the -- the first quarter should be fairly consistent. But yes, you're right, when you back that out, it's going to be slightly better than the fourth quarter with the 50-50.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Okay. Have you announced any -- I think you've closed a couple of plants and a distribution center on Comex. Have you announced any other facility shutdowns or integrations with existing Sherwin operations?","Christopher M. Connor","We've announced 4 closings, Chuck, to date, of the 8 that we had talked about that we acquired. And not all of those are down or cost into the numbers yet but 4 have been announced.","Sean P. Hennessy","So, Chuck, back to your other question, if you take a look at the operating profit in the store group segment, $990 million. You add back the $43 million that we talked about, the acquisition impact, without that, it would have been 1-0-3 -- call it 1-0-3-3. You compare that, that means that the PBT change is $171,000,855. The sales without the Comex was up $476 million, $171 million divided by $476 million, 36.1%.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Two things, first of all, Sean, you referenced, just curious, was there a LIFO charge that was material that impacted the 4Q Paint Stores profit?","Sean P. Hennessy","No, but I think what happens is that when you start -- just look at the fourth quarter, it might not be material. But if you look at the change year-over-year, because 1 year might be a hit, 1 year might be a credit. And those -- we true that up in the fourth quarter. So even though LIFO might be a credit for the year, you might have a debit there because of the way you accrued it in the first 3 quarters.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","So was there a material year-over-year change in how that influenced the 4Q number?","Sean P. Hennessy","I don't have that exact number but I would say -- I was trying to answer the question about why specifically the fourth quarter isn't as pure as the other 3 quarters, so I don't think LIFO is that material between one or the other.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","And then secondly, Comex have owned these stores for a while now, it seemed like they were losing market share and money before you acquired them. Obviously, closing facilities helps on the money side. But in terms of the market share in those stores, how was sales growth performing in those versus the core and how do you feel about the trajectory of market share in that business?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Eric, we've done a lot to stabilize this business since acquiring it. As an example, a number of these stores did not have a full complement of management inside. Sales rep territories were open. Stores were struggling to get inventory when we had acquired them. All of those fixes have been made and made quickly. And we're seeing a stabilization of the existing customer base through these stores. We're every bit optimistic that these things are going to run in line with the other stores inside the districts that they're joining. And so the business is doing fine from that regard and we expect it to get better as time goes on.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates.","Richard O'Reilly","On the Paint Stores Group margins, if we exclude the loss, the acquisition loss, it looks like the margin, if I did my math right, was about 14.3% or slightly down from a year ago, which is a surprise because of the higher volumes. Can you expand that or was the benefit of the volumes all showing up in the Consumer Group?","Sean P. Hennessy","You're talking about the quarter, correct?","Richard O'Reilly","For the quarter, yes.","Sean P. Hennessy","I think when you look at it, without the acquisitions, just from the quarter, like we did with Chuck, you add the $40 million back, you're at $208 million, that would tell you that we were at 12.3% and last year we're at 14.6%. And I would just say it had to do with how some SG&A rolled in. I think when you look at the Stores Group, especially the way new stores rolled in, a little more heavy in the fourth quarter than it was in 2012.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay, fine. Timing of course. Okay. And the volume gain, the Consumer Group has benefited from the volume gains in the paint business, that's part of it, right?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, yes.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay, fine. Okay. Second question on your inflation outlook. A year ago, you said it was also going to be up low-single digit, what did it work out to be for calendar '13, do you have an idea?","Christopher M. Connor","Richard, we think it's pretty stable, year-over-year. And TiO2 was down a little and the rest of the basket was up slightly.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay, fine. So a year ago, you are too pessimistic and now you're looking at the things about the same way. Okay, fine.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the gross profit, guys. On the Lat Am segment, did you say that the profit was $6.4 million increase or decrease?","Sean P. Hennessy","And I will tell you that in 10 seconds here. I've got to double check, because they way you asked the question.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I didn't mean it to sound like an accusation.","Sean P. Hennessy","No, it was a decrease.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would now like to hand the floor back over to management for any concluding comments.","Christopher M. Connor","Thanks, again, Jesse. Let me conclude this morning by asking you all to save the date of Thursday, May 22nd, on your calendars. This is the date we'll host our annual financial community presentation at the Intercontinental Barclays Hotel in New York City. The program, as usual, will consist of our customary morning presentations with questions and answers followed by a reception and lunch. Again, the date is Thursday, May 22nd, and we'll be sending out invitations and related information in the weeks ahead.

An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes, and will be available until Thursday, August 7th, 2014, at 5 pm Eastern Time.","Following the company's review of the second quarter financial results and outlook for the third quarter and full year, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.","Bob Wells","Thanks Jessie and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As you just heard, we've made an important addition to our earnings conference call lineup. Beginning with this morning's call, John Morikis, our President and Chief Operating Officer will be participating in our earnings conference call each quarter.","Many of you had opportunities to speak with John over the years at our Annual Financial Community Presentation. He has a comprehensive knowledge of our operating divisions, customers, suppliers and our industry in general and because most of his discussions surrounding our earnings releases involve these topics it's only natural to include john in the conversation.","We think you'll find his perspective on the state on the industry and our company very valuable. I am going to turn the call over to John in just a moment, but before I do, let me remind you that this conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company\u2019s earnings release transmitted earlier this morning.","In the interest of time, we provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website under sherwin.com Investor Relations Second Quarter Press Release.","With that, let me turn the call over to John to review our financial results for second quarter.","John Morikis","Thanks Bob. It's a real pleasure for me to take part on our call this morning and let me add my thanks to all of you for joining us.","The press release we issued this morning summarizes a very solid second quarter for Sherwin Williams. We continue to see positive momentum in most areas of the business and we clearly had momentum in large part to our consistent focus and prudent investments made over the past five years.","There are still some areas where we face challenges, but the progress we've made so far in this recovery and the bullish signals we are getting from our customers give us confidence that our momentum is sustainable.","I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the second quarter 2014 compared to the second quarter of 2013, then comment on each reportable segment.","Consolidated net sales increased 12.1% to a $3.04 billion, driven primarily by strong performance in our Paint Stores Group and acquisitions. The Comex acquisition added 4.6% to net sales in the quarter, while unfavorable currency translations decreased consolidated net sales 0.9%.","Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $176 million year-over-year to $1.4 billion and gross margins increased 80 basis points to 46.3% of sales from 45.5% in the second quarter last year. This gross margin improvement was primarily the result of better operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume, which more than offset the anticipated gross margin drag from the Paint Stores acquired from Comex.","Selling, general and administrative expense for the quarter increased 15.8% to [$969.2 million] [ph]. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased 31.8% in the second quarter this year from 30.8% last year. Higher SG&A spending in the quarter reflects our continued investment in new stores and sales territories plus incremental SG&A from acquisitions.","Interest expense for the quarter was $16.4 million, an increase of $1.3 million compared to the second quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $48.3 million or 12.7% to $429.2 million. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter this year was 32.1% compared to 32.5% in the second quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30s compared to last year's 30.7%.","Consolidated net income increased $34.2 million or 13.3% to $291.4 million. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 9.6% compared to 9.5% in the second quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 19.5% to $2.94 per share including a $0.06 EPS loss from the U.S. and Canada assets acquired from Comex compared to $2.46 per share in 2013.","Looking at our second quarter results by operating segments, Paint Stores Group had another strong quarter. Segment sales increased 17.2% to $1.88 billion and comparable store sales, sales by stores opened more 12 calendar months grew 9.8%.","Comp store sales growth accelerated 190 basis points sequentially from first quarter 2014 and 280 basis points year-over-year. The rate of sales growth increased sequentially in every customer segment.","Acquisitions added $103.7 million or 6.5% of sales in the quarter. Regionally, in the second quarter, our Southwestern division led all divisions followed by our Southeastern division, Eastern division and Midwestern division.","Paint Stores group segment profit for the quarter increased $42.9 million or 12.9% to $375.9 million as higher paint sales volumes were more than enough to overcome a $10.4 million loss on the acquired stores. Segment profit as a percent of sales decreased to 20% from 20.7% last year, but if you back out the effect of the acquisition, segment profit margin increased to 21.7%.","During the quarter, we opened 16 new stores bringing our year-to-date total to 33 new locations. At quarter end, our total store count in U.S., Canada and the Caribbean was 3,941 compared to 3,542 locations at the end of the second quarter 2013. 98 of the 399 incremental stores were opened organically since the end of the second quarter 2013. This year our Paint Stores Group plans to add approximately 80 to 90 net new store locations.","Consumer Group also turned in a solid performance for the quarter. Sales increased 10.1% to $433.4 million from $393.7 million last year. Acquisitions accounted for roughly half of the increase, while our domestic wood care and building materials business and Ronseal and Altax wood care businesses in Europe accounted for most of the organic sales improvement.","Segment profit for the consumer group increased $13.4 million or 17% to $92.5 million in the quarter, driven by higher sales volumes, improved operating efficiencies and a profit contribution from acquisitions of $2.7 million. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 21.3% from 20.1% in the same period last year, which is gratifying to see following the softer profit performance in the first quarter.","For our Global Finishes Group, second quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 6.1% to $544.6 million due to higher paint sales volumes and selling price increases. Most of Global Finishes Group's domestic business strengthened in the second quarter, but this improvement was partially offset by continued weakness outside the U.S., particularly in Latin America.","Unfavorable currency translation had minimal impact on sales in the quarter compared to last year. Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased 0.7% in the quarter to $54.9 million from $54.5 million last year. These results include charges of $4.5 million related to the exit of our business interest in Venezuela. Unfavorable currency translation rates change reduced segment profit by $600,000.","As a percent of net external sales, Global Finishes Group segment profit was 10.1% in the quarter compared to 10.6% last year. Our Latin America Coatings Group continues to operate in a very challenging economic environment. Second quarter net sales for the group stated in U.S. dollars decreased 8.9% to $181.2 million.","Volumes in the quarter were negative and unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales by 11.3%, both of which were mitigated to some degree by selling price increases. Segment profit in the second quarter stated in U.S. dollars increased to $5.7 million from $856,000 in the same period last year.","In the second quarter 2013, we incurred a charge of $11.8 million related to a Brazil tax assessment. In the second quarter this year, lower volume sales, increased raw material cost, and unfavorable currency translations were only partially offset by selling price increases.","Currency translation decreased segment profit $2.9 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 3.1% in the quarter, compared to 0.4% in the second quarter of 2013.","Although our Latin American Coatings Group results for the quarter and year-to-date are disappointing, we're committed to extending our presence in this important region and we are dedicated and working with all of these sources and expertise required to succeed in that effort.","Turning briefly to our balance sheet, our total debt on June 30, 2014 was $1.69 billion including short-term borrowings of $64.7 million. Total debt on June 30, 2013 was $1.69 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $267.2 million, compared to $741.1 million at the end of the second quarter 2013 and $356.5 million at the end of last quarter.","In the first six months of 2014, we spent $66.9 million on CapEx -- capital expenditure, depreciation expense was $83.5 million and amortization expense was $15.1 million. For the full year 2014, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $190 million to $200 million; depreciation will be about $170 million and amortization will be about $30 million.","That concludes our review of results for the second quarter of 2014. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the third quarter and full year.","Chris Connor","Thanks John and good morning, everybody. Let me begin by saying how pleased I am to have John with us on the call this morning. I am sure you'll find him to be very insightful addition to our conference call team both today and in the years ahead.","At the midway point in the year, we are encouraged by how 2014 is shaping up. More than once in John's comments you heard him refer to the positive momentum in our business. Sales and volume growth began the year at a respectable pace and it appear to be picking up steam as the year progresses.","Consolidated sales growth in the second quarter increased 280 basis points sequentially and June was our strongest month so far. Domestic spray equipment sales, perhaps an unscientific but nonetheless reliable leading indicator of paint sales, robust throughout the quarter.","As John indicated most painting contractors including many who work in the non-residential markets are feeling very bullish about their order books going forward. Consumer group had another good sales quarter and Global Finishes is posting strong year-over-year volume gains in many industrial coatings categories.","Consolidated gross margin also showed significant improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. This is a function of volume-driven operating leverage, but also of stable raw material cost. Early in the year, we identified titanium dioxide as an inflation risk in the second half.","However, it was pretty apparent that the major chloride TiO2 producers have not yet succeeded in implementing price increase announced in the first two quarters.","As I mentioned in our first quarter call, both of the outward pressure on industry raw material baskets is coming from high density polyethylene, which is driving up cost of plastic packaging.","We've also seen higher year-over-year pricing trends in other raw material feed stocks such as crude oil, natural gas and propylene, ethylene and tinplate, but so far these are not effective raw material cost, we are maintaining our outlook for a relatively stable raw basket for the balance of the year.","In the first six months of 2014, we generated $332 million in net operating cash, an increase of $30 million compared to the first half of 2013, driven by higher six month net income. Although working capital is a slight use of cash in the first half, which is entirely due to the accelerating pace of sales growth, our best measure of working capital efficiency, the ratio of working capital to sales, decreased to 11.7% of sales, from 12.0% in the second quarter last year.","During the quarter, we acquired 2.03 million shares of the company stock with treasury, bringing our total year-to-date repurchase activity to 3.33 million shares at an average cost of $200.15 per share and total investment of $665 million.","On June 30th we had remaining authorization require 8.83 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, up from $0.50 last year.","Our confidence in the domestic building and remodeling markets continues to grow and we expect non-residential to play and increasingly important role in driving future paint and coating demand.","Many of the industrial segments also appear to be gaining momentum. These positives will be offset to some degree by persistent challenging conditions in Latin America. Based on this outlook, we expect third quarter consolidated net sales to increase in the range of 9% to 14% compared to the third quarter 2015.","With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income for common shares for third quarter to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.25 per share compared to last year's $2.55 per share.","Guidance for the third quarter includes our expectations that the Comex acquisition will increase net sales $120 million to $130 million, and reduce diluted net income for common share by approximately $0.05 per share in the quarter. For the full year 2014 we expect consolidated net sales to increase 8% to 13% compared to last year.","Although our sales expectations have not changed since our first quarter release, we are raising our expectations for full year diluted net income per common share be in the range of $8.50 to $8.70 per share compared to $7.26 per share earned in 2013.","Included in this full year guidance is our assumption that the Comex acquisition will increase net sales by a low single-digit percentage in the year and reduce diluted net income per common share $0.35 per share. The change in our full year EPS guidance was driven in part by lower than expected dilution from the U.S. and Canada Comex business from our original midpoint of $0.50 per share to our current expectation of $0.35 per share dilution.","Integration of these businesses into our Paint Stores Group and Consumer Group is progressing ahead of our original expectations. We\u2019re on schedule and on budget with respective supply chain consolidation plans and performing better than planned from an operating profit standpoint.","More importantly, we are very pleased with a level of talent, enthusiasm and commitment we see in the men and women to join Sherwin Williams through this acquisition. This, above all, will pay dividends for years to come.","Again, we\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us this morning, and now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Yes, Chris. Just wondering, you know, what\u2019s making you more optimistic about the second half outlook, because it appears even \u2013 post you changing your Comex guidance that you\u2019re looking to about $0.23 improved earnings despite a similar sales outlook. Your contractors, as you indicated, seem pretty optimistic yet the housing data still seems somewhat mixed, so just wondering if you can reconcile those two conflicting items.","Chris Connor","Yeah, Don. I think that\u2019s a good point about the conflicting data we\u2019re seeing out of some of the housing numbers. We just were commenting about the most recent information. It seems that from quarter-to-quarter we have starts up permits down and the exact opposite the next quarter. I think we\u2019re still fairly bullish on the need for improved housing starts to get up to a more sustainable number. But don\u2019t forget that a solid 75% to 80% of all these architectural coatings are being used to maintain existing structures. And I think therein is the momentum that we\u2019re feeling, as John commented about, the anecdotal evidence we\u2019re getting from our contractors. We just think the second half is going to be strong.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","And then just a clarification on your same store sales growth of 9.8%, what was the price volume mix? How much of that first quarter price increase that you posted did you start to realize in the second quarter?","Sean Hennessy","You know that price increase is going well then -- this is Sean Hennessy -- and when you do, we don\u2019t really break out all those different factors, but the majority of our selling price -- selling increase was volume.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Thank you.","Chris Connor","Thanks, Don.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Thanks very much. Chris, you mentioned Comex was -- the integration was going faster than you expected and that provided some earnings leverage. Can you talk more specifically is that because you restructured contracts; took other cost out, what exactly has accelerated the benefit there?","Chris Connor","Yeah. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in any restructuring of contracts per se. [There are variable] [ph] contracts in a business like this when you\u2019re running your own dedicated store business. I think we\u2019re just getting better operating leverage for the company. Raw material cost, implementation of some of the shutdown activities have gone well, ahead of schedule, lower than expected cost impact. I think we have commented the sale of this business is still lagging what we\u2019re seeing in our core business. So it\u2019s mainly on the operating cost side that\u2019s coming in lower than expectation.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","And you mentioned your pretty impressive 10% Paint Stores sales, can you give us a sense what Comex is doing year-over-year and maybe what you think the overall U.S. architectural paint market might do in 2014.","John Morikis","I\u2019d say that the Comex stores are lagging our store sales, and which would be typical in an acquisition like this. As far as the entire market goes, we get that information that lags, but I\u2019d say we feel very comfortable that we\u2019re growing at a faster rate than market right now.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks so much.","Chris Connor","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Hi guys. Good morning. First off on the Paint Stores Group, clearly volumes are well above what your competitor seem to be reporting as it has been the case last couple of quarters. Is this a function of the channel that you\u2019re exposed to, maybe commercial construction or just sort of continued share gains?","John Morikis","I\u2019d say that we\u2019re experiencing very good growth in all the segments that we play, so I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s any specific area. I think we really enjoy this controlled distribution model. We\u2019ve been working hard and investing in the service and products that respond to the customers\u2019 needs and we\u2019re comfortable with our performance.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","And just as a follow-on to that as commercial construction continues to improve generally speaking how does that affect the price mix component in the Paint Stores Group?","Chris Connor","Yeah. We\u2019ve talked about that Ghansham, in the past, some of these larger projects will be at lower selling prices per gallon. But what we said, the SG&A associated with servicing that business really is lower as well so operating margins for this group will benefit from gallons that we gain in any one of these end market segments.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thanks so much guys.","Chris Connor","Thank you, Ghansham.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fisher with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Duffy Fisher - Barclays","Yes. Good morning, guys.","Chris Connor","Good morning, Duffy.","Duffy Fisher - Barclays","Two questions; may be first for Sean. On CapEx, this year\u2019s CapEx looks like it\u2019s even more back-end loaded than normal for you guys. Can you walk through why that\u2019s split is so skewed? And then if you strip out Comex, what was the underlying incremental margin for the Paint Stores Group?","Sean Hennessy","On the CapEx you\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s little backward, slanted toward the back. Again, as Comex conversion, Comex starts conversion they\u2019re going to start taking place here. We\u2019re going to start to see that CapEx ramp up. A few other projects that we had -- originally had early in the year we\u2019re going -- especially with IT then completing the IT implementation of system throughout the world.","We\u2019ll have Latin America here completed by next April, but we have some expenses that are coming in. So really it\u2019s Comex and diversion of the stores and some other activities that we see coming in. And the flow through on the stores without Comex, I think John mentioned the 21.7% of sale, but without Comex when you look at that that will tell you we\u2019re probably incremental in the quarter of about $50 million in the sales, without Comex we\u2019re up around $280 million, so you\u2019re talking almost 35% incremental margin.","Duffy Fisher - Barclays","Okay, great. And then Chris, one question for you, a follow-on on bob\u2019s question. If Comex is going better early does that mean that the end point is higher than we thought originally, or do we just get to the same endpoint that we thought to get there quicker.","Chris Connor","I mean we\u2019re just getting to the endpoint on cost side. So as John mentioned, [inaudible] are yet to really be running at the kind of rate we expect and we get too eventually. So we still have some tough sledding ahead of us here.","Duffy Fisher - Barclays","Great. Thank you, guys.","Sean Hennessy","Thanks, Duffy.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of P. J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup","Yes. Thank you. Chris, can you comment on the refinish business in light of the harsh winter we had? And did you see a pick up there in the spring? And can you also comment on the protective finishes business? Thank you.","Chris Connor","Yeah. P.J., I\u2019m sorry if you could repeat it. I wasn\u2019t sure which business you\u2019re asking me to comment on relative to spring weather.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup","Yeah. Refinish business.","Chris Connor","Refinish business, are you talking about automotive refinish?","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup","Yes.","Chris Connor","John, you will take that?","John Morikis","Our business here in the U.S. was up slightly in the quarter. We\u2019re expecting that the customers that we\u2019re talking with are experiencing more business as a result of the winter, but we\u2019re up slightly here in the U.S.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup","And then you have this sales force that goes out and bids on projects. What are they seeing in non-residential activity, any positives or negatives there?","John Morikis","Very positive. I would say that our contractor base in that space are feeling better -- much better this year versus last year, and quite frankly, much better this quarter than last quarter. So they\u2019re feeling very excited about the bidding activity. And as Chris mentioned, with the spray equipment purchases that we see that as an indicator of their confidence.","Chris Connor","John and I were out recently just meeting with some of these large commercial contractors and some of them said that we\u2019re not even taking any more bids right now. They\u2019re so full up for the next 18 months. And that we haven\u2019t heard that in years, so expecting really strong performance in that going forward.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup","So would you say that that is may be in the high single-digit number?","Chris Connor","Just backed in to all the guidance we\u2019ve given you P.J. and we gave you the range I think it\u2019s either high single or low double-digits for the next quarter.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks P.J.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Chris Connor","Good morning, John.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","So with regard to SG&A, the 15% jump or $132 million change, how are you want to look at it year-over-year? How much of that, or how should we think about what the SG&A growth was for kind of, if you will, legacy Sherwin Williams versus say some of the Comex integration and from the cost around that.","Sean Hennessy","Again, the increase in the SG&A in the quarter and year-to-date really, really been driven by three factors. The Paint Stores Group, the new stores [indiscernible] the acquisition, the Comex assets operated at an SG&A rate materially higher than our consolidated SG&A, the sale, so as we anniversary that that will improve, and again, that investment I\u2019d mentioned in IT.","So we\u2019re looking forward here, the SG&A was up 1.3% of sales as we\u2019ve mentioned in the first half of the year. We do expect to see that thread there to reduce. In fact, it\u2019s also part of the reason why we raised guidance. We expect the second half SG&A to be lower in percent of sales than it was last year in the last six months of the year.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick question on the Venezuelan assets, what was the normal kind of annualized earnings for those assets so we can kind of figure out how much to pull out?","Sean Hennessy","Yeah. The normalized -- it was less than $2 million a year. Unfortunately, over the last few years we\u2019ve been having sales profits there, but we could not get our cash out. So it was a small automotive refinish, but it is in Venezuela. So we picked some severance cost and we closed and we wrote our assets off totally, so that\u2019s why that was approximately $5 million because cash had accumulated and we could not get our cash out of Venezuela.","Chris Connor","Venezuela is to write that asset off.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. Great, thank you. And then one last question, with regard to the case of buybacks certainly things accelerated in the second quarter. I guess how should we be thinking about that going forward? Is this kind of a good run rate for a while, or was it just opportunistic, just seeing kind of what was in the pipeline?","Sean Hennessy","No. We\u2019ve taken a look at our cash flow for the year like we always do. We know how much cash we\u2019re bringing in. And what we said is by the end of the first quarter 2015 we\u2019ll be in a more normalized phase. So we actually have looked at this quarter and actually we did by two -- just over two million shares and that was actually in the form of an accelerated stock repurchase program. So we did that in the second quarter and we\u2019re evaluating what cost program we\u2019re going to do in the third quarter.","Chris Connor","I think it\u2019s not the way to think about that John is that we\u2019re sitting in a higher cash balance right now than is customary for us. We\u2019re heading into the two strongest cash generating quarters of the year for us. And you know what we\u2019d like to do with excess cash. So I would expect it would be reasonable to assume we\u2019re going to remain active in the stock.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Great. Thanks very much for the color.","Chris Connor","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Thank you, and good morning. Just wondering on the same store sales can you talk a little bit about as you\u2019re seeing more contractors coming in, or are you seeing the same amount of contractors just buying more product or better mix or how\u2019s that working?","John Morikis","Now we\u2019re seeing more contractors and we feel as though the share of wallet that we have with our existing customers is also growing. We\u2019re very excited with the progress that our stores organization is making with both existing and new customers.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And just one last follow-up on the non-res side of things, are there particular end markets that your guys are getting reports from that just leading enthusiasm?","John Morikis","No. Actually it\u2019s pretty well diversified growth pattern.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks very much.","Chris Connor","Thanks, Vince.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good morning.","Chris Connor","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","How much did your sales of spray equipment increased in the quarter? And was that rate more than you had previously expected last quarter?","John Morikis","Yeah, Kevin, as you know, we don\u2019t give you specific sales on all those various products segments inside that stores business. So just to say that the whole business is running in comp stores and at high single-digits, spray equipment was probably leading that a little bit, so double-digit sales growth.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And Chris, I want to may be come back to an earlier question. I mean historically existing home sales growth has been a primary driver of demand for architectural coatings obviously, and it looks like economists have that metric in some cases anyway down a bit and yet you\u2019re seeing very robust growth. And so I\u2019m wondering why that might be the case? Is it the non-res move that you alluded to, share gains, lagging maintenance, all of the above, how would you try to square that circle?","Chris Connor","We\u2019ll let out our resident economist Dr. Wells take that.","Bob Wells","Good morning, Kevin. Speaking specifically to non-residential market, because we\u2019re getting contribution from other market segments as we\u2019ve already indicated, so on the residential side we think two things are happening. One is we\u2019re getting a list from home value appreciation, so more home owners who are staying in place are doing remodeling and redecorating projects.","Secondly, if you look at the quality of the existing home transactions that are occurring now versus a year or two years ago, there\u2019s a far lower percentage of those transactions that are distressed or foreclosure-type sales. And as you\u2019ve heard us comment in the past, the owner occupant selling to a new owner occupant is the transaction that generates the more paying activity. We think we\u2019re benefiting from that shift.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That helps. And then last one if I may, Chris, just welcome any thoughts you have on Lat-Am and whether or not we might see volume turn around to positive of territory there anytime soon?","Chris Connor","Yeah. When you\u2019re doing business in Latin America it\u2019s important that you look over longer segments. We\u2019re in one of these cycles where currencies running against us. And there\u2019s a couple of rough spots in their bigger country\u2019s economies. Having said that, and I think John commented on it, we\u2019re still very much committed to the region.","We think there are opportunities for us to enhance our method of distribution and build out our infrastructure there. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re necessarily forecasting in this guidance that we\u2019re going to see volume growth in calendar year 2014, but rest assure we\u2019ll be working hard to get that fixed by 2015.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks very much for the thoughts.","Chris Connor","Thank you, Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Hello, thank you. First question just one, if you look back to last third quarter, Chris, it was a very strong quarter for you guys both year-over-year and I think on seasonally adjusted basis as well.","And so you\u2019re going up against a tougher comp, but you\u2019re seeing a lot in pipelines you talked about driving out acceleration or a pretty similar acceleration and growth now versus the second quarter of this year. If you look across the major end channels of home improvement or repaying on the residential side, new construction residential and non-res, what\u2019s accelerating the most right now as you think about that pace?","Chris Connor","Yes. So I think as John has commented, we\u2019re seeing a very broad-based recovery here, Dennis, across all these segments. New residential has been strong, residential repaint which is the largest segment, we\u2019ve been commenting on that one now for multiple quarters. Both of those will be double-digit increases over previous years to help drive comp number in to that high 9 percentage. That\u2019s encouraging for us to see those two numbers doing so well because they are the lion\u2019s share.","As John also mentioned the non-residential segments, particularly new construction in that are which has been lagging for some time, we\u2019re really starting to see a lot of lift there as well too. So this looks like heading into a back half where we\u2019re going to be hitting on just about every cylinder.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","So you talked about earlier the disconnect on some of the macro, if you just looked at new construction, residential, it is that a disconnect for you guys, are you guys seeing acceleration versus so to say, trends on a macro side?","Chris Connor","Our business in very strong in new residential. One of the anomalies in the June print that just came out this morning is that most of the weakness in start were in South and that has been very strong for the about year to date. So whether that was a one month lift or something the beginning of a trend we will see, but new resident in general has been very strong.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Perfect. Helpful. And then Sean on the Comex acquisition the trend in margins, I think what you said here now we are going to get to the targeted margin sooner, any update on how you can think about the momentum in 2015 versus what you said may be high single digit type numbers in 2015 for the acquired business.","Sean Hennessy","We were looking at high single digits. I think that we are watching how the year ends, but I think that is probably good a guidance that we can give you right now. I think probably at the end of the third quarter or fourth quarter and fourth quarter for sure, will probably be able to update that, but right now we don\u2019t see any changes to that guidance.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. All right. Thanks and good luck.","Sean Hennessy","Thank you, Dennis.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Thanks. Two questions. One on gross margin and consumer. On the gross margin, how much did Comex hurt in the quarter year-over-year and what did mix do to help.","Sean Hennessy","Greg as you know, I don\u2019t think we have ever given the metrics. Our gross margin with and without it was dilutive and it has been dilutive. The only think I will say is given you a range at the beginning of the year 45 to 46 versus 45 last year and now as the year is going through and now we believe we are going to be at the high end to that range.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Got it. And then second on the Consumer Group. A nice improvement there, I think it was acquisitions was half of it and then volume was 5% as well in fact it was driven by retail. Could you describe that a little more, was it -- did you sign up any new distribution or was it was just strong sell through or what you really account for that.","Sean Hennessy","We have a new program that we're roaring into Home Depot that we were excited about in our conference line. We've also, as I mentioned seen some nice improvement out of our European operations as well as our building materials.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Of the 5% volume, would you say that those two were majority of them.","Sean Hennessy","The largest one would have been Home Depot.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Home Depot, great. Thanks a lot. Good luck.","Sean Hennessy","Thank you, Gregg.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts - UBS","Thanks for taking my call. There are couple businesses I guess that might come available for sale here in North America and you seemed to be going at a measured pace, which you repurchase, keep your flexibility. Could you talk about the M&A pipeline?","Sean Hennessy","Yeah John. So we've been very clear and open and transparent with the street in terms of the types of properties that would be of interest to us. We would agree that there are some interesting names in North America as well as in our industrial coating segments globally but nothing further to comment on at this time.","John Roberts - UBS","Okay. And then secondly the plan A in Latin America was to get scale to get the margins to improve there. Is there a plan B given scale doesn\u2019t look achievable and at least in the near term that I can see.","Chris Connor","Most of the plan B John and that C and D has to go along with that one. Just as you were representing M&A opportunities there are a number of interesting names and companies that we respect throughout Latin America. So we're certainly not done thinking about building scale through M&A throughout Latin America.","And also as has been our practice, we are a company that's focused on our core development. We have good scale already in these countries. We are not the market share leader in the larger economies, but call it second or third and that's not a bad position to build from.","So we have a number of imitative to really ramp up our own core group as well as to continue to think about M&A and I think as we commented earlier that you know we are very focused on this region and we expect to do better in 2015.","John Roberts - UBS","Thank you.","Chris Connor","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Good morning and thanks for taking my question.","Chris Connor","Good morning, Nil.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","On the Comex -- is Comex going to be more dilutive in the fourth quarter than it is for any of the other quarters and if so why would that be the case.","Chris Connor","Yeah, when you take a look at the year-to-date -- when you think about the year-to-date loss on Comex $0.45 and it's compared to the 35 and then compared to last year, it won't be any dilutive. It's 18 and it's 17 in the second half of the year, but they have a sell curve just like our Stores Group and if you take a look at that volume they are closer to the breakeven points in that third and fourth quarter -- I am sorry, the first and fourth quarter and that's why they are more dilutive.","Years ago if you looked to our Stores Group in the first and fourth quarter, when we were closer to the breakeven we had the same phenomenon, but we will get there with the Comex stores with higher volumes, but until that happens the first and fourth quarter will be a bigger drag than the rest of the Paint Stores Group.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Okay. That makes sense. Then in terms of having the point of sale in the Comex Stores now for a couple months is there anything you are seeing, I know before in the past you guys have said that there is pricing, lower pricing and lower fill rates. Is there anything new that you\u2019ve seen that you can make improvements on and work for those? How quick those get to share one type level.","Chris Connor","We are very excited with what we are learning to the POS and we are excited about the future. We're going to be able to leverage that POS much like we do in our own stores understanding our customers better.","To your point about pricing, a basket approach, what are they purchasing from us and what they are? So we're excited about that and as we go into next year, we're going to leverage that.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Great. And then just finally I know Latin America now seems like almost unfortunately a bit of an afterthought in terms of profitability and you are certainly looking to improvement it by 2015, but is there any reason that it won't get any worse.","Sean Hennessy","Yeah. I think that we have currency headwinds and if you think about especially the first Brazil real the third quarter and fourth quarter can be better comparisons for us.","If you look at Argentina, right now we have been running at that 8% versus 5%, that will be 8% versus 6% in the second half of the year that's a little bit of difference, but it continue to evaluate in that third and fourth quarter, but operationally I don\u2019t think that we still feel we're strides and improvement our operation. So except for that, I think that you know I don\u2019t see it going backwards from here.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","And how much of you have been able to offset the currency drag with pricing.","Sean Hennessy","Well, I think that when you talk -- if points were failed and shall we get the amount of currency drag when it's over 11% and again in U.S. dollars we were down around 8% and there were some volumes that did backwards, so we gave some price.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Great. Thanks so much.","Sean Hennessy","Thank you, Nils.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","Good Morning.","Chris Connor","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","Two things. First of all the earning guidance change for the quarter and the back half of the year it looked like you have affirmed the sales guidance and increased the earnings guidance.","So the assumptions that margins are better and Sean I know you commented about how SG&A looks into the second half versus first half, but can you provide a little bit more color inside of the core earnings guidance change. The sales mix is different or the margin is different especially out a little bit.","Sean Hennessy","We don\u2019t see the sales mix changing dramatically from our original guidance. Eric, I think it really comes down to the gross margin. We did mention 45 to 46. We're at 45 halfway through the year. We think for the full year we're going to be at the high end in the next guidance.","The SG&A we did mention you know the first half of the year, the comparisons were bad. We had more new stores earlier this year than we ever have. Some of the things that we were going to start anniversary we think our SG&A in the last six months will actually be below the last six months of last year. So still good thing. So I think that it's the margin in total and that's because of sales mix just because of things that are occurring and getting some of those other things out of the way in the first half of the year.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","Is the SG&A stand different in the back half than what you originally expected or is there something different within that relative to where you started that you are thinking.","Sean Hennessy","I think the SG&A spend will probably be slightly below what we originally thought at the beginning of the year, but not dramatically. And I think importantly in that Eric, the SG&A spend is lower because we are integrating the stores better, we are gaining efficiency there haven\u2019t been a whole sales decision to whack programs in marketing, advertising, training, R&D, etcetera. So this is just really the company continuing to add efficiency around the fringes as we integrate businesses.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","And then second question, Chris for you. Strategically you went through a period of time with acquisitions outside of the U.S., outside of the U.S. architectural business, I heard your comment earlier about sale of Latin America, so I am just curious as you think strategically about the portfolio and acquisitions from hear and if you could give us a sense of your thoughts or your priority or what's important for you going forward.","Chris Connor","I think this management team has been pretty much locked on a pretty logical strategy here for quite some time Eric that hasn\u2019t changed at all. We like the architectural coatings businesses in the Americas and we recognize that our industrial coatings are competing in a global environment or wherever we can find controlled distributions to support those American businesses or add technologies, infrastructure, important geographies and\/or customers to the industrial coatings will be at the table and discussing those opportunities.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","Thank you.","Chris Connor","Thanks Eric.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of [Arun Viswanathan] with RBC Capital Market. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question. Good to be back covering chemicals. How the customers I guess been responding to the price increase? May be if you can just describe their behavior or given that you do expect a flat rock bucket.","Chris Connor","Not really been an issue I would say with our customers. And we've had a logical discussion with them and we continue to provide them with a good quality product and great service and it's really behind us.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. And then I guess -- I just wanted to delve into the earlier comments you mentioned that you were seeing strength in the South and maybe you can just highlight what you're seeing growth on the res and non-res side regionally speaking and if there is any differences.","Chris Connor","As Bob mentioned the strong performance that we are having in the new residential has been in the south. We've also had good performance in parts of Northern Area and then Western and Eastern as well. Commercial has really been strong. It's really been quite strong across all segments across all our regions.","Sean Hennessy","It's been our practice to kind of give you that ranking of where the strength is coming from and so we've continued on and sometimes when we are preparing our thoughts to share with you, we think about when all the segments are doing so strong in all the geographies, it really kind of splitting areas to tell you which parts of country you are doing better. So this is really a business through the Stores Groups that is just delivering across the country, across all segments as John commented on them.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great thank you a lot.","Chris Connor","Thank.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","Hi. Good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about Latin America in a different way. Do you think the volume softness this quarter had more to do with the World Cup than an actual drop-off in demand? And then the second part of that, when you look at 2015 and 2016 and what the economists are expecting for housing growth and then commercial growth, what does that outlook -- what does that look like.","Chris Connor","I don\u2019t know that we want to say that it was a World Cup influence our results and there are markets that we would say are impacted by the economic conditions or the environment and there is somewhere we just need to perform better and that\u2019s we are working on. I didn\u2019t catch the second part of your question.","Sean Hennessy","So the expectation on the market conditions going forward, Jay, I guess we have confidence that when we look behind the results today, the housing needs going forward in Mexico, the infrastructure, that hasn't been maintained as appropriately it is a should have been perhaps in Brazil, the demand for the types of products and services we provide, we'll have to have a rebound going forward. And I think that's why we continue to stay hard at it, improving our operations investing and trying to build out our network.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","Okay thank. And then the second question I have just in the U.S. if you look at single family housing demand versus multifamily housing demand. Is multifamily an increasing portion of your business and what types of numbers do you get there whether on profit margin or on volume growth relative to what you see in single family.","Bob Wells","Jay, this is Bob. With respect to demand, multifamily is a larger component of a new construction markets than it was during the last cycle. And we think that's probably going to be true for some time although as you know the multifamily size is really voluble and to oscillate quarter to quarter and year to year.","We think that for the time being that the U.S. is going to be more of a renders market than an owner's market for some time to come. From a margin standpoint we've always commented that it really doesn\u2019t affect us from an operating margin standpoint all of the segments that have very comparable operating margin.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","Okay great.","Chris Connor","Jay, the one positive on the multifamily side is that while single family homes the maintenance activity in those homes is kind of a mix of DIY to contractor on the multifamily side, it is overwhelmingly maintained by contractors, which plays to our strength.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","Okay. Great. Thank guys. Appreciate it.","Chris Connor","Thanks Jay.","","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Good morning, guys and congratulations on quarter.","Chris Connor","Good morning, Dmitry","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","I would like to touch base on your corporate expense line. It's been off pretty material year-over-year. Some of it obviously Comex, but a lot of it is probably not Comex. So in the context of your SG&A in the second half of the year being down as a percentage of sales versus second half of last year, how much of that is going to be corporate expense versus just better margins in the operating businesses?","Chris Connor","Even with the Admin expense we were up $31 million in the first half of the year and as we take a look at the -- take that down at $25 million, that split really between stock compensation and other compensation such as bonus and the IT projects that we've been working on.","The second half of the year, we don\u2019t think we are going to be up the $31 million. So that's going to help, but even if we were up, when you add up $31 million, that's a nice improvement, but really the SG&A is really been driven by the operating division.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay. Got it. And then can you provide us with updates, if anything is going on, or any changes with respect to the litigation in California, how that's progressing, and also given the news in the market with PBG taking a run at Comex, if that's changing at all, your mutual animosity in the courts with the Comex owner.","Chris Connor","Dmitry with respect with California Litigation, there is really no changes in the status of that suite since our last call. As you know last quarter, we announced that the final judgment was entered against three companies. We immediately filed a Notice of Appeal in that judgment and we are currently waiting for the record to be transmuted from the trial court to the Court of Appeal.","It tends to be a fairly long process. We think the record would probably be transferred in the third quarter. At that point the court will initiate a briefing schedule, which is going to take at least five months and once and then all arguments will begin and once all arguments conclude it's another 90 days for the court to render a decision.","All totaled we continue to believe that the decision by the Court of Appeals is going to take approximately two to three years. As far as the Comex issue is concerned we are still in arbitrator and there is still a lawsuit filed by Sherwin Williams in the New York Court and at this stage we are in the process of selecting arbitrators.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research ","Got it. Then not to beat the dead horse to death here, but in terms of your Latin-American operations obviously there's not much you can do without the facts other than maybe push through pricing which you have been doing, but for you to turn that business around and the performance of that business and actually get out on a positive trajectory either this year or next year, is there anything that you guys can do internally or do you have to rely basically on the currency and the end markets improving?","Sean Hennessy","No, there's a lot we can do internally, Dmitry and it's the same kind of playbook that we assume run the company deliver the results we have. We need to knock on more doors, call on more painting contractors move more gallons of paint, be more efficient.","When the economies come back and the currency runs our direction, it will be really, really good. In the mean time, we're working on the things that we can control.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","So are you increasing your sales presence there in terms of outside sales people and how do you bang on more doors?","Sean Hennessy","We have invested in more people to promote our sales and our gallons in the marketplace absolutely.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","All right. Thank you.","Chris Connor","Thanks Dmitry.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Eugene Fedotoff with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Chris Connor","Good morning, Eugene.","Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Congratulations on a good quarter.","Chris Connor","Thank you.","Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Couple of questions on store group sales for the quarter, if you can comment on anything that you\u2019ve seen maybe something outside of normal seasonal improvement and also maybe you can comment on sales in first half of July here.","Sean Hennessy","We mentioned the time is good and all segments across all of our divisions and that momentum is continuing here as we begin July.","Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks and a question on DIY customers of your stores. I think previously you\u2019ve talked about gaining market share in that particular segment. Just wondering if that's still the case, you are seeing strong growth in DIY presence and how was 4th July weekend for that segment I guess?","Chris Connor","Performance in DIY is also strong. The weekend was good for us as well and again the momentum is continuing.","Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Great. Thank you.","Chris Connor","Thanks Eugene.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Thanks very much. I imagine that sequentially your tin prices in North America went up, is everything now priced in so that tin prices sequentially going forward should be flattish or is there still more realization to come?","Sean Hennessy","I think the price increase we've realized what we're going to get from the price increase. We don't see a big improved increase in the third or fourth quarter Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","And you commented before that you thought that the TiO2 market was benign for the remainder of the year, when you look out over the next two or three years, do you still see it as benign or you do you see it as changing?","Chris Connor","Jeff, it's always based on the balance and supply and demand in the market. Coatings demand in North America should continue to grow as we move back towards normalized levels. That said as you know, there is plans on the drawing board for a new high-capacity TiO2 plant in Mexico. There is continuing supply growth coming out of Asia Pacific. So it just all depends on how on the timing of those factors.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Chris Connor","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Thank you and good afternoon now I guess.","Chris Connor","Good afternoon, Richard.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Okay. In the consumer group the profit contribution from Comex at $2.7 million is that all flowing from the sales gain? My math is the $19.7 million or does some of that flow through from the paint stores like what happens in the legacy Sherwin Williams.","Sean Hennessy","No that income is actually from a couple different sources that are in consumer group. The duck back products as well as the viewer business we have up in [tied in] (ph) Canada, so that process is really not being driven by the stores group.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Okay. Good. Okay. And second question, I guess you are trying to answer this, but for the second quarter alone for Comex, your profit, the loss was smaller than you thought, but the sales were clearly at or below the low end of your projection, what's going on -- why are the stores -- Comex stores lagging your expectations?","Chris Connor","Why are they lagging our expectations, we expected them to be behind and they are. As we commented, Richard when we made this acquisition, that this was a troubled asset in North America and we are building these stores out and improving their inventory position and we've already talked about the equipment etcetera and so it's going to take us a while to reestablish those relationships and get those gallons and customers coming back.","John talked about the things we're learning in this for example, the ability to add on associated product sales for equipment etcetera and these all things that are we're going to be working on aggressively going forward.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Okay. Fine. Now you just came out I guess the stores -- Comex stores business, which is at the low end of your expectations for the quarter.","Chris Connor","Well actually expectations we gave were $0.10 dilutive for the Comex that's in the second quarter. We actually were $0.06 dilutive.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Baked in sales, the sales\u2026","Chris Connor","Right. They're at the low end of -- sales that are still at the low end of the expectation, that's correct.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Okay. Thanks a lot for your time guys.","Chris Connor","Thank you, Richard.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","I can't believe it I still have questions left to ask. Thanks for extending the call. Couple things, I was curious first I want to make sure we get the gross profit dollar changes if it's possible by segment before we get off and then just can you tell us about what your competitors are doing?","They seem to be really busy on the acquisition front, whether it's your North America last year and then down in Mexico? I am just wondering strategically how you view that and what you would like to do to kind of fortify yourself?","Sean Hennessy","I'll take the gross margin dollar real quick here, so we get that -- make sure we get that, our Paint Stores Group were up $142,500,000 million, consumer was up $21,959,000, our Global Finishes Group were up $8,418,000 and Latin America Group was up $4,211,000.","Then regarding our competitors there and we've long commented about this terrific industry that we compete in that we're blessed with really outstanding companies to compete against.","We respect the strategies and performance of all these folks and we look forward to meeting them on the battle field and I think our results as John commented earlier particularly in the area of share gains, we're showing that we're pretty confident. We've got a good model here. We're going to continue to work it hard.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Thanks and just last thing, you wanted to get your cash balance down, is it fair to assume that historically you were kind of sub $100 million in terms of cash you would like on the balance sheet. Should we assume that that's about right for your long term or do you think you need more of these?","Sean Hennessy","Yes we think that we don't think we need -- we need liquidity sources. Our liquidity sources are strong, but I believe our cash flow will be below $100 million again in the future.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Thanks guys. Have a great quarter.","Sean Hennessy","Thank you, Aram.","Operator","Thank you. It appears there are no further question at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.","Bob Wells","Thanks Jessie. As always, I will be available for the balance of today, tomorrow and throughout the coming weeks and to your any follow-up questions you might have.

An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes and will be available until Monday, November 18, 2015, at 5 pm Eastern time.","Following the Company's review of the third quarter financial results and outlook for the fourth quarter and full year, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells, Senior Vice President Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Sir.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.","We are going to begin the call as usual this morning with some prepared remarks by John Morikis, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Chris Connor, Chairman and CEO. Following their remarks, we will open the call to questions and Sean Hennessy, our Chief Financial Officer, and Al Mistysyn, Vice President Corporate Controller, are here with us this morning to participate in the Q&A session.","Before I pass the microphone to John, let me remind you that this conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings, and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in our earnings release transmitted earlier this morning.","In the interest of time, we've also provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website at www.sherwin.com under investor relations third quarter press release. With that, let me turn the call over to John to review our performance for the third quarter.","John Morikis","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone.","Our results in the third quarter 2015 clearly demonstrate the earnings power of this business model. Although we faced some difficult headwinds to revenue growth mostly related to currency devaluation, further softening in demand for industrial coatings, and a slow recovery in domestic construction activity, diluted net income per common share increased 18.5% to $3.97, an all-time high for any quarter in our history.","Sales volumes lagged in many of our operating segments, but our domestic architectural paint volumes remain strong and drove operating rates higher in our US manufacturing and distribution facilities. This resulted in significant operating leverage in the quarter. This operating leverage, combined with stable pricing, favorable raw material costs in most of our domestic businesses, and good SG&A expense control across the Company drove consolidated gross margin, TVT margin, and net income as a percent of sales falls to record levels.","I will spend a few minutes highlighting overall Company performance for third quarter 2015 compared to third quarter 2014, then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased of 0.1% to $3.15 billion. Solid domestic demand for architectural paint was mostly offset by weak volume demand in our non-domestic business and currency devaluation. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $103 million year over year to $1.57 billion and gross margin increased 320 basis points to 49.9% of sales from 46.7% in the third quarter of last year.","Selling, General, and Administrative expenses for the quarter increased $9.3 million to $993.6 million. As a percent of sales, third-quarter SG&A was 31.5%, up 30 basis points from last year.","Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million, an increase of $970,000 over third quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $76.7 million or 16.2% to $551 million. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter this year was 32% compared to 31.2% in the third quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30%s compared to last year's rate of 31.2%.","Consolidated net income increased $48.3 million or 14.8% to $374.5 million. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 11.9% compared to 10.4% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 18.5% to $3.97 per share compared to $3.35 per share in third quarter 2014. Unfavorable currency translation decreased earnings-per-share $0.09 in the quarter.","Now looking at our results by operating segment. Paint stores group turned in another strong profit performance in third quarter, although sales were lighter than expected. Segment sales increased 2.9% to $2.09 billion. In comparable-store sales, sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, grew 2.1%. Regionally in the third quarter our southeastern division led all divisions followed by Midwestern division, Southwestern division, and the Eastern division.","Paint stores group segment profit for the quarter increased $75.6 million or 17.5% to $507.4 million. Segment profit as a percent of sales increased to 24.3% from 21.3% last year.","During the quarter our paint stores group continued to expand its store footprint, opening 23 net new stores. This brings our year-to-date net openings to 45.","We remain very confident in the long-term market opportunity for this group and we are on pace to open between 100 and 110 new stores this calendar year and close between 20 and 25 redundant store locations. Today, our store count in the US, Canada, and the Caribbean stands at 4048 compared to 3959 a year ago, an increase of 89 locations in the past year.","For our consumer group, sales increased 9.4% to $421.6 million from $385.2 million last year due primarily to the volume contribution from our HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams Paint program at Lowe's stores. Segment profit for the consumer group increased $9.3 million or 11.8% to $88.3 million from $79 million last year. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 20.9% from 20.5% in the same period last year.","For our Global Finishes Group. Sales in US dollars decreased 9.3% to $486.1 million in the quarter as global industrial coatings demand declined further and currency headwinds strengthened. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 8.3% in the quarter compared to last year. Global Finishes Groups business in North America performed better than any other region; however, volume declines in all regions in the third quarter compare to the same period last year.","Segment profit in US dollars decreased 9.2% in the quarter to $55.1 million from $60.8 million last year due primarily to currency translation and a $6.3 million gain on the early termination of a customer agreement recorded in the third quarter 2014. Unfavorable currency translation reduced segment profit $9 million. As a percent to net external sales, Global Finishes Group segment profit was flat at 11.3% in the quarter compared to last year.","Our Latin American Coatings Group continues to operate in a very challenging economic environment. Third-quarter net sales for the group stated in US dollars decreased 22.1% to $156 million. Volumes in the quarter were negative, and unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales by 23.6%.","Segment profit in the third quarter, stated in US dollars, decreased to $2.1 million from $11.8 million in the same period last year. Lower sales volumes, currency-related raw material cost inflation, and unfavorable currency translation in the quarter were only partially offset by selling price increases.","Currency translation decreased segment profit $5 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment profit was 1.4% in the quarter compared to 5.9% in the third quarter 2014.","That concludes our review of results for the quarter so I will turn the call over to Chris Connor who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year. Chris?","Chris Connor","Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today.","I think John's opening comments pretty much said it all. Revenue growth was weaker than expected in the quarter, but the earnings power of our Company has never been stronger. Volume demand lagged our initial expectations for the quarter in virtually every market we serve, but we remain focused on delivering positive results regardless of the demand environment. I feel confident in saying that is precisely what we did in the third quarter and have done throughout the year.","In the first nine months earnings per share increased 22.3% over last year on revenue growth of just 2%. Our year-to-date consolidated operating margin and gross margin are both at all-time highs, and we maintain our pricing discipline despite soft demand in a very competitive market environment.","Our paint source group provides the clearest picture of domestic market conditions and there were some noteworthy bright spots in the quarter. Sales of residential retained contractors through our paint stores continue to grow at a double-digit pace. Sales volumes for the new construction markets, both residential and nonresidential, also increased compared to last year, but at a slower pace than the residential retained market.","Our DIY business was down slightly in the quarter and protective and marine coating sales were down significantly. In total, Paint Source Group grew third-quarter revenues by just under 3% with volume growth slightly stronger than that, and architectural paint volumes well outpacing revenues.","Our consumer group is working closely with Lowe's to build momentum behind the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program. As we indicated on our second quarter call, HGTV sales through Lowe's are trending towards the low end of our target of 2% to 3% of consulted revenues for 2015. Consumer group's core business performed better in the third quarter than second, constant roughly flat to third quarter last year.","We continue to see deteriorating demand for our product outside of North America. Sales volumes in most Latin American countries fluctuated modestly compared to third quarter of 2014, with the exception of Brazil where volumes and revenues declined significantly. The impact of currency devaluation once again was worse than anticipated in the quarter.","Global Finishes Group also felt the brunt of softening industrial coatings demand and deteriorating currencies in both Europe and Latin America, but made progress in offsetting these effects through price increases and tight SG&A control. Our third quarter was also a record quarter for past generation.","Net operating cash in the first nine months was $902.5 million, up about $21 million over last year, the third quarter accounting for about $553 million of the total. We're on pace again this year to generate net operating cash at a rate above 10% of net sales or at 10.3% year-to-date despite higher working capital required to support the HGTV HOME program at Lowe's.","Nine-month working capital picked up slightly to 11.1% of sales from 10.8% last year. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was $557 million compared to $583 million last year.","We continue to invest a portion of the Company's cash back into the business in the form of capital expenditures. Through the first nine months of 2015 we spent $158 million on CapEx. Depreciation expense was $127 million and amortization expense was $20 million.","For the full-year 2015, we anticipate CapEx spending to be in the range of $220 million to $240 million. Appreciation will be about $170 million, and amortization will be about $26 million.","In the third quarter we repurchased 325,000 shares of our common stock on the open market, bringing our year-to-date total to 2.575 million shares and an average price of $282.20. On September 30 we had remaining authorization to acquire 2.65 million shares.","On October 21, our Board of Directors approved an additional authorization to acquire 10 million shares of the Company stock for treasury which will be added to the 2.65 million shares remaining from the previous authorization. The Board also approved the quarterly dividend of $0.67 per share up from $0.55 per share last year payable on December 4 to shareholders of record on November 13.","Looking ahead to the balance of the year we anticipate our consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter will be low single digits and percentage terms compared to last year's fourth quarter. With sales at that level we estimate diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.95 per share compared to $1.37 per share earned in the first quarter of last year, an increase of 33% at the midpoint of the range.","For the full-year 2015 we expect consolidated net sales to increase off by a low signal digit percentage compared to full-year 2014. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance calling for diluted net income per common share for 2015 to be in the range of $10.75 to $11 per share compared to $8.78 per share earned in 2014, an increase of almost 24% at the midpoint of the range.","Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning and I would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hey guys. Good morning.","John Morikis","Hey Ghansham.","Ghansham Panjabi","Maybe John with the new high watermark for margins.","John Morikis","He's up to the task, don't worry Ghansham.","Ghansham Panjabi","John, good luck with that. First off on the Paint Stores Group and your 2.1% reported same-store sales, can you sort of parse out for us the performance between architectural and some of the other protective coatings in that market that you saw in that channel?","Chris Connor","The architectural side was by far the strongest. We had a very good and strong performance in architectural and our industrial protective and marine side we clearly faced some headwinds there. We do very well, particularly in the petrochem area, we out index probably the market by quite a bit and with the softness there that has a netiquette impact on our volume.","Ghansham Panjabi","So architectural two to three times?","Chris Connor","Yes.","Ghansham Panjabi","And I guess on that note should we expect same-store sales to continue to be pressured by these categories in 2016 or do you think there will be a tailwind from the [indiscernible].","Sean Hennessy","This is Sean Hennessy. When you look at 2016, I think we're putting that together right now and I think in January when we discuss the fourth quarter we'll also be giving you some guidance on 2016 and give you a clearer picture.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the raw materials side. We did have some declines here as well in the third quarter. Are you still kind of sticking to the mid single-digit decline in 2015 and what's your outlook for 2016?","Bob Wells","Yes. This is Bob. We are still sticking to our mid single-digit decline for year-over-year average raw material basket for the industry. We think in the back half it is likely trending to the high end of a mid single-digit range just based on the trajectory of raw materials over the course of the year, but we're standing by ever mid-single digit outlook. For 2016?","Arun Viswanathan","Right.","Bob Wells","I'm sorry, Arun. Maybe I misunderstood the question. We are really not in a position to give a raw material outlook for 2016 yet. We will do that on our year-end call.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. Appreciate that. As a follow up, on the volume side, 2% comp in the quarter. I was just curious how that played out versus your own expectations. I think last time we were expecting a slight increase in Q3 versus Q2 which did a 3.9 and then I guess similarly maybe you could just talk about if there's been any structural changes to the market which would prevent you from going back to the kind of mid single-digit level for next year? Thanks.","Bob Wells","I would tell you when you look at our sales guidance for the third quarter to where we came in, I think that we were a little disappointed in the comps store and stores group. We were not disappointed at all in the architectural performance. We felt that we continually said over the long run we think we can beat the market by one and a half to two times. We think we are right there.","On the protective marine side there was a little bit of a challenge, maybe a little more of a challenge than we thought and that hurts us two ways. That hurts us in the volume and secondly the average selling price. So, that has a little more effect on the cause of that Q1 to be lower. Structurally, those type of things on the architectural side we still are as confident as ever.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aram Rubinson of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Aram Rubinson","Thank you. Two questions. First of all on the paint stores. You did indicate that the volumes were higher than the comp. Can you just give us a sense on the price mix element? I think last quarter it was a negative 1.5%. What are we looking at in the third quarter for price mix and maybe break it down?","And then also I know you were going after the R&R contractors a little bit more. That might have hurt your mix in Q2. What did we do with that in the third quarter?","Sean Hennessy","I think the biggest impact of the price mix, Aram, has been the comments that you are hearing this morning about the struggles continuing into protective and marine. As a reminder, these are gallons that can sell upwards of $100 a gallon for us. As we commented, the pricing disciplines of the Company are in great shape.","You see that in the margins. Our residential repaint numbers are up double digits as we commented, so the price mix issues are really holding up fine on the price side, it's just the types of end market gallons are having a little impact here.","Aram Rubinson","Then could you help us. I think you guys are doing some things on the store front that you may not have talked about which is kind of leaning down the stores, doing more centralized deliveries, working capital being a bit more centralized. Are there things you are doing on the store side that are worth airing in that regard?","Chris Connor","No. Nothing worth talking about truthfully. Our focus is on making sure that our people and our products are where our customers need them. So anything that we're doing in the field is to better align our resources with our customer's needs.","John Morikis","And there is really no programs that we're undertaking, Aram, in that space at all. That is just not beyond our normal efficiency practices.","Aram Rubinson","And then just if you can give us the gross profit dollar increase by segment and then I'll leave you guys for the next questioner.","Sean Hennessy","Okay. Give me one second. Gross margin dollar changed in the third quarter by segment same-stores group increased $89.2 million. Consumer was increased by $34.2 million. Global Finishes Group was down $5.6 million, and the Latin America Coatings Group was down $[17.8] million.","Aram Rubinson","Got it. Thank you. It looks like your Paint Store Group gross margin was about the same as the house from our map. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays.","Duffy Fischer","Question on how you achieve your awesome margins in Paint Stores. Obviously if volumes were not as strong as you had anticipated -- incremental margins are very strong, so every gallon you don't sell should hurt.","The mix seems to hurt in protective and marine as a higher ASP so I'm assuming more profitable, but yet you just crushed the margins. Can you talk through how you were able to do that?","John Morikis","A couple things. Again, just back to the point that Chris just reiterated, I think architectural gallons we're really good, I think that any time we get those architectural gallons going in the right way. I think that number two we had really good SG&A control in Storage Group. So when you see our total SG&A up $9 million, I know it's 3\/10 of a percent of sales so, that's going pretty well.","And the Comex. We had the Comex integration in the third quarter. We are now fully through it. We think the third quarter was you see the full effect of the Comex. You see it in two places.","When you talk about this Comex you see it in Stores Group as well as you see it in Consumer Group. And you look at the operative margins that consumer was able to generate, so that Comex acquisition is doing very well now, integrated very well by our teams in the field, and you're seeing those types of things in both of the segments.","Duffy Fischer","Okay. And then maybe just a to shift a quick to the HGTV. We've gone through one paint season trending towards the bottom end of the range you thought about. What's the after action review on that? What went well? What didn't? Is it just going to take a little bit longer, brand recognition and stuff like that, and what should we expect different next year?","John Morikis","Duffy, as we look at this going forward we're quite excited. We have got a good partner with a good relationship there. We've learned, there is no question about it, and we're comfortable with the direction we're going here.","We continue to work hard with the store associates as well as Lowe's corporate. We've expanded our SKUs just recently launching into a satin finish which is a very important finish in the home center channel, so we're expanding our SKU count, we are getting more in tune with our customer, and quite frankly we're looking forward to a strong future with this program.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thanks, guys.","John Morikis","Thanks, Duffy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill","Thank you. I guess this question is on the overall gross margin. Setting a record high and I think you've obviously said that a lot of times over the years, but is there a point where you worry at all about competitive actions or worry more than normal about competitive actions or threshold where you feel like you have achieved everything on the margin side?","John Morikis","Dennis, we worry about that every day, so thanks for calling that out to our attention. Obviously the market dictates the prices we can get for our products. We compete in a very respected industry. The quality of our products and the services can command a price in the market I think you're seeing the leverage of the business model come to fruition here.","Dennis McGill","Okay. And on the protective and marine, can you maybe just split out a portion of revenue within that segment that would be tied to that piece of the business?","John Morikis","Tied specifically to the petrochemical part of it?","Dennis McGill","Not just petro but the protective and marine as a total within Paint Store?","John Morikis","Inside the store's business?","Dennis McGill","Yes.","John Morikis","That would be low to mid teens, Dennis, 13% to 15% of the Paint Stores Group revenue.","Dennis McGill","Okay. Great. Thank you and, Chris, thank you for the honesty and humor over the years. We'll miss you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. It's [indiscernible] in for Jeff. How are you? You said that your core consumer gross was flat in the quarter, so that means that HGTV contributed maybe $40 million to sales? Is that about right?","Bob Wells","That's in the range.","Unidentified Analyst","That's an range. Okay. And another gross margin question. So, prices went low again this third quarter and as best as we can tell nobody has realized those benefits yet. Very few raw material inventories probably in the fourth quarter. Do you expect to have more raw materials benefits in the first half next year?","Bob Wells","We obviously give a detailed raw material outlook on our year-end call in January. We have commented that based on the current trajectory of the petrochemical side of the raw material basket, raw materials should be a tailwind next year. We will give you a little more color around that at year end.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And lastly, do you have in outlook for your corporate expense in the fourth quarter? There was a pretty large environmental component in the fourth quarter last year and probably reappear?","John Morikis","Exactly. When you look at it, we do not have the environmental repeating. I think when you see the EPS guidance we have given you versus last year, you can see that -- and that environmental went into the admin segment so, yes, just because of that you're going to see an improvement in that admin segment.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar of Citi.","Dan Jester","Good morning. It's Dan Jester on for PJ. I think I heard you correctly that you said that the DIY business at the stores was down in the quarter. I was just wondering are you seeing any evidence that maybe the program at Lowe's is taking DIY customer away from your store?","Bob Wells","No. We don't think that is the impact in the quarter at all. That HGTV program was a de minimus part of our store's business. We've always felt that the customer that chooses to shop in a specialty paint store is a fundamentally different customer than a big box customer.","And in the quarter, softness was really driven over some timing and promotional activity earlier in the quarter and it's actually been rebounding nicely. We had a good September in DIY stores to our stores business.","Dan Jester","Okay, and then kind of sticking with that theme. I believe you talked previously about kind of re-energizing your investment plans and some of your other brands and consumers like Dutch Boy and Pratt & Lambert. Should we be thinking about any major programs using any of those brands in the future?","John Morikis","We are obviously looking at every brand and evaluating the investments that we go in there. We're going through our planning process right now with our teams. You would expect that our diversified brands team is in fact looking at some of those brands to get behind and we will be talking about those as we roll into next year.","Dan Jester","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Chris Evans","Good morning. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. The challenging environment outside of North America, if you could talk about how you plan to sort of manage those declines you're seeing in Latin America in your global finishes brand?","John Morikis","I think that as a company we've always taken a look first and foremost when you're looking in Latin America if you look at the history of us, making sure that we remain cash positive and just like Argentina in 2002 and some of things that happened in the 90s with hyperinflation, we continue to make sure and we stay cash positive which makes it easy to continue to invest in those kinds of countries.","Secondly, whether it's even in United States stores group, in Houston in the 80s or other places, if there's something -- we try to take advantage of these types of markets and we're looking at assets and we're looking at investments down there that eventually will come back.","We think Latin America is having a tough time currency-wise, but the things will be able to do in Mexico this year and we're still investing in the rest of the Latin America group for us. We feel very good about the long term of this business.","Chris Evans","Thanks. And then you talked about raws and margin expansion a bit and maybe I missed it, but did you break out or could you break out what portion of that margin expansion was from raws?","John Morikis","Yes. What we prefer to say is when you look at the Comex integration, the ability for us to take those gallons through our own footprint and I think that's completed and gallon gains. You have the gallon gains over in Stores Group as well as Consumer Group, so those factors are well over half. We don't break it out in those -- we say those, that's the majority of the margin improvement and raws is just the smaller piece of that.","Bob Wells","Chris, the other thing is if there's a positive mix shift with Stores Group growing faster than any other segment, that has a positive effect on gross margin as well.","Chris Evans","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.","Chuck Cerankosky","Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. You guys addressed a lot of the mix and margin questions with Paint Stores, but I want to make sure understand something. If you're looking at some of these protective and marine coatings, obviously they can sell for quite a bit more than the architectural.","Is it right to assume automatically that they have a high margin and then what happens when we're dealing with the strong operating leverage in the architectural gallons? John, can you talk about how all that mixes together in the final margin number we see?","John Morikis","Yes. When you look at the protective marine that's going through the stores group, it's not very different. The operating margins, the SG&A and so forth, it's very close to the architectural business, but as you say, the costs are higher and the selling prices are higher.","Bob Wells","So that means the strength in architectural volume was really driving the train?","Chuck Cerankosky","Yes. Alright. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys. This is [Matt] [ph] in for Vincent. I was wondering if you could speak to the underlying demand environment in Canada and the impact Paint Store Group and Consumer there.","John Morikis","Demand in Canada has been spotty. With our new acquisition, Comex, rolling in now, we're excited about the future here. This brand that we bought in and the conversion we're going through offers us opportunity as we consolidate the general paint brand into our Sherwin brand. So, going forward it may in fact come from market share gains, but we're expecting to move forward in Canada.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. And then in terms of the impact of inventory cycles in the big box retailers, did you feel any effects from that throughout the quarter?","John Morikis","No. Nothing to speak of. No.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Good morning. I think a lot of my questions have been answered but I would like to follow-up on obviously the shortfall in revenues and your performance for the earnings line above the top end of the guidance you provided from the first quarter.","What were the one or two sort of biggest differences between your expectations regarding cost for the margin side heading into the quarter versus what turned out to be the case?","Sean Hennessy","I think what it really came down to, Dmitry, was protected marine sales and secondly was the currency. The currency was -- we did not have the Brazilian Real getting close to 4 to 1 and those two things, but when we looked at what we thought we could do with the Comex integration and the selling price and the architectural side, it was pretty close to what original guidance was.","Dmitry Silversteyn","So that's my question, Sean. You had revenues that were lower than you expected for a variety of reasons but your earnings were above the top end of your expectations or top end of your guidance, so something must have happened between the revenue line and the net income line.","Sean Hennessy","Okay. I think it was the SG&A control. No doubt about it. I think the gross margin might have been a couple cents different than we thought, but I think the SG&A increasing only $9 million in the quarter. I know the divisions has been working really hard to get that SG&A down and I think that is the operating margin difference.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Are those levels of SG&A spending sustainable when you see the business going forward or was this sort of a reaction to what you saw going on in the market with the currencies and demand and we can expect those SG&A levels to recover somewhat as you head into 2016?","Sean Hennessy","No, they are sustainable. Going forward, we believe we can continue to run.","Dmitry Silversteyn","At these levels. Okay. Secondly, can you talk a little bit about it sounded like your pricing was relatively flat both in the core group and the consumer group. Can you talk about the impact on the mix, if you will, on the revenue lines from lower protective and marine coatings and whatever else may be driving that as well as the consumer line?","Sean Hennessy","I'm sorry, Dmitry. Bob mentioned that protective and marine accounts for low teens percentage of our stores business and by design these are products that sell for two and three times what a typical architectural product sells for.","So a lot of that mix shift is coming as a result of the softness in that business. I think we've commented that pricing is holding up well. You're clearly seeing that in the margins performance, so with the exception of kind of that customer shift inside that business, there hasn't been a lot of mix.","We did comment that the residential repaint customer continues to grow at a double digit piece for us. Those are good, solid architectural gallons for us at reasonable pricing and you can see the impact of that go into the chain.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. If I'm looking at the price mix components and assuming that your prices flat year-over-year, if I'm hearing sort of low single digits, negative mix is that sort of the right way of looking at it?","Sean Hennessy","I think that -- with one exception, Dmitry, and that is we've talked about competitive pricing in the large commercial project that has a little bit of a negative effect on a very small piece of the market but by far and away the largest impact on the difference between sales and volume was that negative mix from primarily protective and marine.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Got you. And then if I could follow up. I want to make sure I heard you correctly. Did you say that sales were approximately $40 million for the quarter for HGTV at Lowe's?","John Morikis","Yes. Because of the comment we made about relatively flat without and that's where the computation will get you to.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. That's down almost 60% from the second quarter which I understand benefited from that but if I'm sort of the $40 million number coming up with 150, maybe 200 from a prior quarter in the maybe warmer months, that's sort of low end, below the low end of the guidance that you issued for this business.","So, are we sort of going to grow into this with a full paint season and maybe a couple more in 2016, 2017 or was there some level of disappointment with the performance of this product at Lowe's this season versus\u2026","John Morikis","It's on the low end of our range so, yes, we're disappointed. We strive to exceed that range, but going forward we have great confidence in our team and we have a great partner with a great relationship.","As I mentioned we've added a SKU here that's an important SKU in the satin finish and we continue having great discussions about other opportunities, so I think you're right, we're going to grow into this and were excited about the future here.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. Very good. Let me follow-up. Typically when offers discounts and prices my understanding is [indiscernible] on the paint supply on a 50\/50 basis more or less. I understand it's your agreement with Lowe's may be a little different. Are you participating in this by one get one free gallon offer that is going on at Lowe's right now?","John Morikis","We will not comment on that Dmitry. We don't comment about the specifics of any customer.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich","Thanks, good morning, guys. Two questions. If you look at gross margin which was up 320 BPS for the Company, how would you break that down year-over-year between raws and mix shift, whether it be geographic or product? How should we think of that overall?","John Morikis","Greg, as an ongoing basis we have never broken price mix gallons out. What we try to do from an earlier question is we're saying that when you look at the 320 you have the Comex integration which was very positive for us.","We've taken their gallons and their footprint through our footprint. I think also the increasing gallons of the Stores Group as well as the increasing gallons in the Consumer Group and also as we've always said that the Stores Group has the highest SG&A as a percent of sales, so when you look at the operating margins that means that the gross margins are the highest as we sell directly to the end user.","As they become a bigger and bigger piece of the Company, that is going to create that mix. And then there was raw materials in there. Those are all the factors and what we said is if you look without -- raw materials really didn't drive this. It was the other three factors that drove it.","Greg Melich","So the order you gave them we should assume is a rough order of importance?","John Morikis","Yes.","Greg Melich","Great. The second question I had was a bit on the outlook and also what impact of the quarter. You mentioned wet weather delaying some construction. I know that was something that happened in the second quarter in June. Could you give us some ideas of where that is and how that might be looking as you look forward?","John Morikis","Yes, Greg. It looks very positive. We commented on the call that the residential repaint activity has remained strong. It's actually been strong for going on three years now and if you look at housing activity in general, there's a lot of reason to believe that the recovery is still in full swing.","Household formations have been very strong and have remained strong. Existing home sales are up almost 8% year over year. Pending home sales up almost 10%. Average home values are pricing and continues to rise which is healthy for the industry, and on the new construction side it's even stronger with new home sales up almost 20% and single-family starts up more than 10%.","Non-residential starts slowed a little this year, but the interesting thing this year there is that in 2015 despite it being down slightly from 2014, it's the second strong this year since 2008. We have back to back to back strong years of starts in nonresidential activity which is going to drive commercial painting in the years ahead.","Greg Melich","I guess I have one last one since we have Chris and John and the whole team there. There's enough turmoil going on in the world. Sometimes this is when opportunities really arise. Are there parts of the word that you think Sherwin should be more greatly involved where for the next year or two if it gets worse could be a good opportunity to enter? Thanks.","Chris Connor","We are always looking for those opportunities. That could be by customer or by segment and we keep a close eye on to those. As you should expect, our teams on the ground are empowered and pursuing those opportunities as they present themselves.","Greg Melich","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ivan Marcuse of KeyBanc.","Ivan Marcuse","Thanks for taking my questions. Real quick on the consumer business. Why did margins continue to remain flat if you have higher volume and raw materials coming through? Why wouldn't you see some leverage there?","Sean Hennessy","Our operating margins in the consumer group were up 40 basis points in the quarter for the year. We said that the Lowe's business is fairly neutral. It's not accretive or dilutive this year.","How with all the sales could you get the operating margin up? So I think you can imagine what kind of increase that has. That's really where -- I think it's a great positive story that again integration from Comex is creating that kind of value that the Lowe's business at close to zero operating margin is not affecting the total operating margins for the consumer.","In fact, remember, at the beginning of the year many people thought that the Consumer Group would go backwards in operating margins because of that Lowe's business.","Ivan Marcuse","Great. And just a quick question probably for Sean, this is for you. Interest expense, if I did the math right, it looks like that was down a little bit. Why did interest expense jump and what would you sort of expect the run rate and is there any plans to add that, et cetera?","Sean Hennessy","Yes. In the month of July we issued bonds, took out the short-term debt. We issued $800 million at effectively 4%. That's $32 million. When you look at next year we expect that our interest expense will be higher as we term that out.","You can imagine we were paying 20, 22 basis points for that $800 million in the short-term market and now we're at 4% with that, but we expect -- what we said is we think our interest expense will be up. In fact, Marybeth asked this question a couple quarters ago and that's about 20% next year.","Ivan Marcuse","The interest expense will be up 20%?","Sean Hennessy","Yes.","Ivan Marcuse","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli of Gabelli & Co.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Good morning everyone and congratulations. Since most of the questions or all of the questions have been asked about the operations in the third quarter, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your new announcement, you're paint shield and give us a feel for the market size, how unique which may not be that unique, to have something. Can you touch on that particular basis?","John Morikis","Well, actually no one has a product like this. This is a very unique and exclusive and patented technology and it is a product that we are very proud of. The market size that you asked, it's a little hard to define as we're finding more and more opportunities for this. We look for the opportunities in schools, athletic facilities, in senior care facilities and hospitality settings, even in residential areas, wherever these infectious bacteria may exist we feel as though this product offers an application.","And in a nutshell what we have here is our Company has successfully suspended compound in a paint product that will kill bacteria. It's very unique. If you look at the issues, the hospital space, it's quite an issue. The product that we have will kill 99.9% of staph, MRSA, E. coli, and a couple of other bacteria that really pose a serious challenge to our hospital and these other areas that we mentioned.","To develop a product that does not just inhibit these microbes but actually kills bacteria is very unique and it's the first EPA registered product of its kind. So, there might be other products, but nothing like this.","Rosemarie Morbelli","So you say EPA registered is that -- how do you go through that process? Is that similar to FDA or do you take already an approved bug killer, I can't pronounce any of those, that has been already approved and then you only need the EPA to approve the fact that you can actually put it in your paint?","John Morikis","No. And the way you go through this is very painfully would be my answer. It took us a number of years and quite an effort on our team's part. We are very proud of our team and the process that they went through.","So, it is a product that is, as I mentioned, EPA registered. It's the first microbicidal paint that kills these bacteria. It lasts up to four years. We really believe this is a game changer in the industry. We're very excited about it. We had a wonderful launch yesterday and we're really looking forward to the opportunity that this product will present.","Rosemarie Morbelli","And you can't share more or less what your anticipation, revenues that can be generated from this product over the next I don't know, three or five years?","John Morikis","We just do not disclose that type of information. We're very excited though, I will say that. We're very excited.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Otherwise you wouldn't do it.","John Morikis","That's fair.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you very much for your help.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay McCanless of Sterne, Agee.","Jay McCanless","Good morning, guys. First question I had is, and this is going back to the oil and gas and the protective, when the oil prices starting rolling over last fall did you see the gallons start to roll off at the same time or was there a lag effect and has that carried through to the last two to three quarters while oil prices have been coming down?","John Morikis","I would say there was a little bit of a lag. We didn't see it immediately, but it has accelerated recently.","Jay McCanless","Okay. And then could you disclose for global what percentage of that is going to be under the protective and marine and petrochemical, what percentage of revenues?","Sean Hennessy","Yes. We don't break that out, but I will tell you the majority of that is actually in the Service Group.","Jay McCanless","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS.","John Roberts","Chris, my thanks as well. Was all of the HGTV sales in the quarter sell-through or was there still some sell into the channel going on?","Sean Hennessy","There was no sell in, it was all selling out. It was through. There was no loading in.","John Roberts","And then some of your competitors talked about significant destocking in the retail channel at the end of the season. Were your gains in spite of seeing that or did you really not see much of that?","Sean Hennessy","We didn't see that.","John Roberts","You didn't see it. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Wong of Morningstar.","David Wong","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I just had one since a lot of them have been asked already. Can you give us a sense of your operating leverage that you discussed. Can you remind us what portion of your costs are fixed versus variable, especially on the SG&A line?","Sean Hennessy","On the SG&A line we've always said that a high percentage of our SG&A is fixed and we've always said that because we wouldn't open a store without a manager, assistant manager, the right to staffing model.","When we open a store we consider a lot of that fixed and that's how we manage a company. We say if we're going to open a store, probably when I sit there and look at it, the way we look at it, almost 90% of it is fixed, 10% is variable.","David Wong","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nils Wallin of CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin","Thanks and good morning, just about. I had a question on your top-line expectations for the fourth quarter. Obviously this year-on-year for the third quarter was kind of flattish and you're assuming some sort of growth maybe mid single-digits in the fourth quarter. What's the cause of that inflection point?","Sean Hennessy","I think if you look at the way, and we're guesstimating here on the foreign currency, but if you remember, fourth quarter is when it really started to fall off. If you think about the value of the dollar just jumped in the fourth quarter, so we comparisons get better, we don't think the currencies may get stronger, but just the comparisons get better.","So we're seeing that. And just looking at the business and where we're at in the other areas. Someone said it earlier, even though there was a lag we did start seeing some of the protective and marine in the fourth quarter being negatively affected. We think those are the reasons you see the 1\/10 going up to the mid low single digits.","Nils-Bertil Wallin","Understood. On the HGTV and Lowe's I know another participant asked about the buy one get one free, and I believe that was in the third quarter. It's continuing into the fourth quarter, so I'm just curious how you think about that in terms of brand recognition, brand quality. Will this type of discounting cause you to rethink how the brand will be positioned next year?","John Morikis","Again, this would be a better discussion for Lowe's. Their pricing of that product is something that they determine.","Nils-Bertil Wallin","Okay. And then just finally I guess in Global Finishes there was some degree of organic of weakness. Is there any market share shifts happening because others who are in the refinish business seem to still see some growth there?","John Morikis","In the automotive refinish business I'd say we do see some pressure there. There's a great deal of consolidation that's taken on in that space. We have found ourselves on the wrong side of some of the transactions that have taken place, so we felt a some pressure in our market share.","Nils-Bertil Wallin","And how do expect to address that?","John Morikis","Well, every day we're trying to address that. Our products and our services we think are good. We are trying to align ourselves with the right customers and ensure that the introductions that we have of both new products and our people are in the right place doing the right things at the right time.","Nils-Bertil Wallin","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Bob Wells for any closing remarks.","Bob Wells","Thank you again, Carrie. As always, I will be available for the balance of today, tomorrow, and throughout the coming week to answer your follow-up questions. I would like to thank you again for joining us this morning and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.","Operator","This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for attending.

We have summarized the first quarter earnings per share comparison in a Reg G reconciliation table at the end of our press release. Let me take a few minutes to breakdown our performance by segment. Sales for The Americas Group in the first quarter increased $74.4 million or 3.6% to $2.15 billion.","Unfavorable currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.5%. Comparable store sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 3.6% in the quarter. Regionally in the first quarter, our Southeast division led all divisions followed by Eastern, Canada, Southwest, and Midwest. Sales were positive in every division in the quarter. First quarter segment profit decreased $6.3 million or 1.9% to $331.1 million.","Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit $4.5 million in the quarter. First quarter segment operating margin declined 80 basis points to 15.4% from 16.2% last year. Turning now to the Consumer Brands Group, first quarter sales decreased $1.9 million or 3\/10th of a percent to $654.5 million including the divestiture of the Guardsman business. Sales from continuing operations excluding approximately $17 million in Guardsman revenue increased 2.4% in the quarter.","First quarter segment profit increased $13.7 million or 18.5% to $87.9 million. Purchase accounting cost decreased segment profit by $22.9 million compared to $31.8 million in the first quarter 2018. First quarter segment operating margin increased to 13.4% from 11.3% last year. Excluding the purchase accounting expenses in both quarters, adjusted segment operating margin increased to 16.9% in the first quarter 2019 from 16.2% in the first quarter last year.","For our Performance Coatings Group, first quarter sales increased $3 million or 0.2% to $1.23 billion. Currency translation rate changes reduced first quarter sales by 3.9%. First quarter segment profit increased $7.9 million or 8.7% to $98.7 million. Unfavorable currency translation reduced segment profit $3.5 million in the quarter and purchase accounting expense decreased segment profit by $54.1 million compared to $57.5 million in the first quarter of 2018.","First quarter Performance Group Segment operating margin increased to 8% from 7.4% last year. Excluding the purchase accounting expense in both quarters, segment operating margin increased to 12.4% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 12.1% in the first quarter last year. That concludes our review of operating results for the first quarter.","So, let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments on the first quarter and provide our outlook for second quarter and full-year 2019. John?","John Morikis","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd like to make -- just a few additional comments on our first quarter before moving on to our outlook. First quarter volumes were a bit lighter than anticipated across all three segments, driving consolidated results to the lower end of our expectations range. We commented in our press release issued this morning that the North American architectural painting season got off to a slow start compared to last year. But it's important to keep this in perspective. It is traditionally the smallest revenue quarter of the year. It is - probably year-to-year. So it's often not very representative of underlying demand trends.","Robust feedback from our professional painting contractor customers has long been our most reliable indicator of North American architectural paint demand. These customers almost universally remain optimistic about 2019 and continue to report unseasonably high project backlogs in a very healthy pipeline of new projects. This consistent feedback underpins our confidence in our full-year outlook, in spite of the slow start to the season. Our sales results in the quarter highlighted the geographic variability in demand, we have seen since mid-year last year.","Volume growth in North America ranged from stable to strong with a few exceptions, while the softness in Asia and Europe was fairly broad based but also with the few noteworthy exceptions. Pricing was favorable across all of our businesses in a quarter, while the impact of currency translation on all three segments was a bit more of a headwind than expected, but we're not satisfied with our top line performance. Consolidated gross margin on an adjusted basis improved 60 basis points sequentially and was flat year-over-year at 43%.","This is encouraging given our expectation that the rate of raw material inflation year-over-year will be highest in first quarter. We expect to see more gross margin improvement over the balance of the year as volumes pick up, the rate of raw material inflation moderates and we continue to benefit from pricing actions announced over the past year. SG&A in a quarter came in largely as expected and we'll continue to maintain appropriate discipline on spending as the year unfolds.","Within the Americas group, sales increased 3.6% against the prior year comparison of 6.6%. Sales volume growth in our North American stores fell short of our expectations. Sales to protective and marine and residents or repaint contractors were our strongest customer segments in the quarter both up high single-digits over last year.","All other customer segments were positive. Our business in Latin America went from positive double-digit growth last year to a high single-digit decline this year due to high-teens unfavorable currency translation. Segment profit dollars and margins for the group were negatively impacted by lower than anticipated volume, which in North America was likely the result as projects being postponed. During the quarter, we opened 15 net new stores finishing the quarter with 4,711 stores in operation, compared to 4,624 last year. Our plan calls for this team to add approximately 90 to 100 net new stores in the Americas by the end of this year.","In the Consumer segment, first quarter sales were positive in North America. Even if we include the negative impact of the Guardsman divestiture, demand was considerably softer and non-domestic regions during the quarter most notably Asia Pacific, made pretty good progress on improving the profitability of this business. The segment margin excluding purchase accounting impacts increased both sequentially and year-over-year. This is the highest quarterly operating margin reported by this segment since the acquisition of Valspar. We are successfully executing our strategy in this business and we are well-positioned with our retail partners heading into this spring - selling season.","Performance Coatings Group sales in the quarter grew modestly against a challenging prior year comparison of 9.8% on a performer basis. Revenue and volume growth in packaging and coil was offset by flat to down sales results in the segments other businesses. Geographically, sales increased in North America but these gains were offset by declines in Asia Pacific and Europe, where sales were down high single and mid single-digits respectively.","We continue to see some benefit from our pricing actions across these businesses and regions as adjusted segment margin improved by 30 basis points year-over-year to 12.4%. EBITDA in the quarter was $533 million or 575 million on an adjusted basis to exclude the pension plan settlement expense and acquisition related costs.","Working capital was a higher use of cash in the quarter as we built additional inventory through our fourth and first quarters to ensure our ability to respond to anticipated strong seasonal order volumes in our stores and retail customers. At the end of the quarter, we had $94 million of cash on hand that will be utilized to fund operations and reduce debt.","The balance sheet reflects total debt of approximately 9.8 billion. We intend to reduce our net debt by approximately 600 million during the year, which will result in a net debt to EBITDA ratio below 3 to 1 by the end of 2019. After prioritizing debt reduction over other uses of cash during the past two years, we are resuming our historical capital allocation philosophy in 2019. We returned approximately $410 million to shareholders during the quarter including $105 million in cash dividends and $305 million to purchase 750,000 shares of common stock.","During the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 31% to $0.0113 per share. At quarter end, our share repurchase authorization stood at $9.38 million shares, capital expenditures were $51 million in the quarter. Depreciation was $65 million and amortization was $79 million.","As we move into the second quarter 2019, we expect consolidated net sales to increase 2% to 5% compared to the second quarter of 2018. With the Americas group at or above the high end of that range as a reminder second quarter revenue comparisons to 2018 in the Americas group and the Performance Coatings group are the most challenging of the year and consumer brands group faces comparisons to early load in volume from the lows program in the divested guardsman business.","Our full-year 2019 revenue guidance remains unchanged with net sales increasing 47% compared to full-year 2018. On an earnings per share basis, we believe the most meaningful way to provide guidance is to exclude thus far acquisition related costs in non-operating items. On this basis and given our sales outlook, we are confirming our adjusted 2019 full-year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $0.02040 to $0.02140 per share, an increase of approximately 13% at the midpoint compared to the $0.01853 reported last year on a comparable basis.","We've included a Regulation G reconciliation table with this morning's press release to better illustrate all the moving parts. We expect our 2019 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range, a few additional data points for the full-year may be helpful for modeling purposes, these data points have not changed from the guidance we provided in January, we expect raw material inflation for the full-year 2019 will be in the low single-digits compared to 2018.","The rate of year over year inflation assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and those supply disruptions should diminish from the level we saw in the first quarter as we progressed through the year. We expect incremental synergies of approximately $70 to $80 million in 2019 and a total annual run rate of approximately 415 million that year end. We expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $320 million, depreciation to be about $257 million, and amortization to be about $315 million.","With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Parkinson","Great, thank you. As it relates to your intermediate term outlook for U.S. housing, can you just hit on the key ongoing trends by sub-region, just any updated views on rates, affordability, single versus multi-family, and just any preliminary views on sales [ph] would be greatly appreciated? Thank you.","John Morikis","Yes, Chris, and we're going to sound a little like a broken record on this subject because we continue to believe that the sharp declines in starts year to-date particularly in single-family is not a reflection of a decline in demand, and in fact March new home sales were pretty strong. So that kind of underpins our view that the rate of new home construction is unsustainably low at the current rate, given continued strength in household formation. Household formations are going to continue in the range of, call it, 1.2 million to 1.3 million annually for the next five-plus years. And historically, if you look at the rate of new home starts, they've run at approximately -- a rate of approximately 1.3 times the rate of household formations, and that's just to account for housing units that are taken out of stock over time either by natural disaster or demolition, whatever the case may be. But over the past four years, housing starts have run roughly in line with household formations.","And as a result, what we've seen is inhabitable vacancies have largely been absorbed and single-family rental stock is being converted to owner-occupied stock, and we don't think that is going to be able to sustain demand for housing long-term. So, it's a broader answer to a little more granular question that you asked, but we think the challenge for builders continues to be building affordable entry level units given high land cost, high land development costs, labor costs et cetera. And while we think that the starts in the first quarter were abnormally low, we expect to see a pick up in starts as we go through the year. We agree with the outlook that home building should be up over 2018 and 2019, it's likely going to be up modestly, low single-digits.","In terms of any regional variation, the Southeast continues to be very strong. Southwest has had some challenges, but should pick up as well, and that's where you're going to see most of the activity.","Christopher Parkinson","Got it. And just a quick follow-up -- kind of the ongoing multi-year integration Performance Coatings, it seems like you guys are back on the track on the pricing fronts, can you just comment on your updated long-term views by sub-segment with just an emphasis on general industrial packaging and wood, just what have been the biggest surprises, both positive and negative? Thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Hey, Chris, this is Al Mistysyn. I'm going to talk about the consolidated segment and then I'll let John comment about the individual pieces, but as we saw in our first quarter nice year-over-year margin improvement and that's really the teams doing a great job, working with their customers to get the pricing to offset the persistent raw material inflation that we saw, and also seeing nice synergy realization and controlling their SG&A. So, we have talked about targeting high-teens to low 20% operating margin, and we feel like we're on that track here in 2019 and more to come as the year progresses.","John Morikis","So, one or two things I'll add to that, this continues to be something that we're very focused on. We believe that as the two companies came together, we found ourselves in an inflationary period and felt that it was important to work with our customers through that process of implementing these prices. I don't know we are going to breakdown every segment to tell you the ground that we're gaining in each one, but I will tell you that we are great gaining ground in each one. And while we've accepted some compression over the elevating raw material basket, we also believe that the solutions that we're bringing our customers and the services that we're providing as part of those solutions are opportunities for us to work with our customers in pushing through those price increases, and we're determined to do just that.","Christopher Parkinson","Okay. Thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff John Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff John Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Are the raw material trends in the United States different than they are in the offshore markets? And how would you compare raw material price inflation U.S. versus the rest of the world?","John Morikis","Jeff, I think there are some differences in certain commodities like titanium dioxide. I don't necessarily believe that the petrochemical side of the basket is vastly different as you look around the world. TiO2 has been stable in the U.S. And I think it's been moving a bit more in Asia Pacific and Europe. The petrochemicals, kind of surprisingly given the move in crude oil have been somewhat stable with as, you know, with propylene and ethylene actually trading down, you're trading lower year-over-year. We have not seen much benefit from that in our raw material basket yet, but we expect to as we move through the balance of the year.","Jeff John Zekauskas","Okay. You said in your press release that your same-store sales growth was 3.6%, the quarter in the Americas group, like order of magnitude, are prices up 2.5 and volumes up one for the first quarter?","John Morikis","Yes, Jeff, that sounds about right. We talked about the realization coming out of our year end call about 2.5, and we might be a little bit better than that, but I think you're directionally correct.","Jeff John Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","John Roberts","Thank you. Well, Nippon's deals for Dulux in Australia change your strategy at all in Australia?","John Morikis","No, it shouldn't.","John Roberts","And then, in the packaging coatings area, are we still seeing penetration from non-BPA, or is that now largely over with?","John Morikis","We're having very good success in our non-BPA RV 70 products. In fact, packaging with the exception of all our industrial businesses it was up globally and it was up in all regions. So, we continue to see a nice performance in our packaging business.","John Roberts","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Truman Patterson","Hey, good morning guys. Just wanted to touch on the Americas group's margins, in the first quarter, they saw about 80 bips year-over-year. Could you just explain why this was, and how much of it would you say was it due to the lack of volume and leverage versus raw material inflation may be coming in a bit heavier than what you expected?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Truman, you know as John mentioned in his opening remarks, the first quarter in North America is our smallest quarter and most volatile, and it truly is all about the volume and, it's a little lower than anticipated in our North American, Paint Stores Group and to your point, we also saw higher year-over-year raw material inflation in the quarter. So those are driving that margin but that being said, we continue to invest an 87 net new stores over the past year with a corresponding increase in sales reps to support those stores, that's a continuation of our consistent long-term approach to the North American architectural market, and we have not slowed our cadence down on the store openings just because of the last two quarters we've had. And we believe this is going to continue to allow us to grow market share one and a half to two times the market, and has historically allowed us to gain a larger share of the market, when the -- when the cycle turns. So, we talked about the price increases and I feel pretty good about those, and with the price increase and the demand outlook that John talked about in his opening comments, I am confident, that our TAG organization is going to expand margins this year.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Thank you. And to follow-up on that, with the raw material inflation you guys -- could you guys just give an update your prior I think low single-digit raw material inflation guidance and I'm just trying to understand your confidence in this in your guidance considering 2018, kind of caught everybody off guard, especially with your guys comment that 1Q is going to be the high watermark for raw material inflation, considering that oil seems like it's ticked up quite a bit here lately?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Truman. At this point, I think our outlook for first quarter being the peak appears to be at least correct so far, your point on oil moving it's certainly moved quite a ways but probably the ethylene have not, and propylene, in particular which is the primary feedstock still is down year-over-year, it's barely moved off a $0.32 bottom. So, those being the primary drivers of the petrochemical side of our basket still look very favorable. I'm not saying they couldn't move with crude oil but they haven't thus far. Our outlook for low single-digit inflation for full-year presumes that the highest year-over-year increase as you said was in the first quarter. And I think it's safe to assume that the market average price for the broad basket of materials we buy was probably up in the low to mid single-digits in the first quarter. We expect to see that moderate as we go into the second quarter. Not to say second quarter couldn't be inflationary but it will be lower inflation than we saw in the first. By the time we get into back half it should be deflationary.","Truman Patterson","Okay, okay. Thank you and just a follow-up real quick. If I'm reading you correctly with propane and ethylene still being down year-over-year, are you saying that there might be a chance that your oil derived resins might be down in the back half of the year?","Al Mistysyn","There's a chance, they stepped up sharply midyear last year and while we're not back to below the level they were prior to June last year after as we annualize that move up in midyear, there's a chance they'll be down year-over-year in the back half.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Thank you.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hi, guys, good morning. John, in your prepared comments, you reference strong backlogs at the customer level for the Americas Group. Can you give us some more color on that which verticals in particular had a stronger backlog? What feedback specifically are customers giving you in current market conditions especially as interest rates progressed lower throughout the quarter?","John Morikis","Ghansham, I'd say that we're really excited about the balance of the year because of the feedback that we're getting across all the verticals, all the segments. We've obviously have a terrific model in this controlled distribution where we're able to really keep our fingers on the pulse of the customer and the feedback that we're getting has been pretty universal as I mentioned earlier. It's solid across the geographies and the segments, so we're feeling very good about the balance of the year obviously get into a little bit of a slower start than we would like to have seen but still feeling really good about where we're headed.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. And then just on consumer brands, you mentioned that you're very well positioned across all the North American retail channels. Can you also expand on that? Do you think that channel itself will improve in 2019 versus the past couple of years or is that your specific positioning post the share shift that you're particularly excited about? Thanks.","John Morikis","Well, I think our customers should hold us accountable to help them improve their results. We want to work with our customers and help them reach their goals. So we continue to work with those partners working to drive their success and we do that by helping to ensure that our products are consistent and the high quality, the brands are strong, that we have the right relationships in the right channels with the right assortment allows us to bring that value to the customers that we have and the consumers that they serve. And each one of those customers offer a unique opportunity growth and we're making sure that we're aligning our people of resources everything that we have to help them reach their goals. So we want to help those customers outpace the market.","Ghansham Panjabi","Thanks you.","John Morikis","Thanks, Ghansham.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Koort","Thanks. John or Al, when you guys talked initially about your synergies from integrating Valspar, you mentioned that some of those manufacturing maybe would be a little longer tail? So can you give us an update on the progress there and what's left to come?","John Morikis","Yes, Bob. We're still working through it by region as we talked about the longer tail on those is predominantly in the industrial space which are more complicated and take longer to get done. I would say there are amounts in our $415 million run rate that we talked about coming out of this year. But we'll get those fine tuned here in the next quarter or two and try to give more color around those as we go forward this year.","Al Mistysyn","And Bob, I know you and I have talked about this to some degree. Our goal is certainly to attack those synergies but we're not going to do it at the cost of a customer. The goal is not to get just the cost out. We want to become more efficient. No question about it, but we're taking our time to make sure that we're taking the right steps. And as these synergies roll in, we want to make sure it's a more favorable experience for our customers and put our salespeople in a better position to serve those customers.","Robert Koort","And can I ask your Lowe's business now you're the single line paint supplier there. Can you talk about how that makes you a better supplier, the paint aisle better at Lowe's having sort of a uniform or unified supply strategy there?","Al Mistysyn","Sure. It ensures the terrific alignment that I touched on earlier. We are looking at a collaborative view of how do we help our customer reach their goals? And so the sharing of information and the tactics that we use are certainly in line with their goals. And it allows us to have more open dialog with how to best help them reach those goals. And so there's a lot of momentum there, is a terrific leadership team that is driven to improve those results and we want to make sure that our resources are in line with the goals that they have.","Robert Koort","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Byrne","Yes, thank you. Bob, you were talking about your outlook for second half raw material costs potentially being down year-over-year. Does that conviction come from your purchasing costs for raws today being down year-over-year that will flow through COGS in the next couple of quarters?","Bob Wells","Yes, that's part of it, Steve. We have been building inventory with lower cost petrochemical raws. Part of it is the lag that that our suppliers have in passing through lower cost feedstocks and those feedstocks working their way through the acrylic chain. And I'd say probably the latter point is most of it.","Steve Byrne","Okay. And John, you mentioned some of your contractor customers have what you described as unseasonably high backlog other than maybe a break in the last six months worth of weather. Is there anything else that you could see holding them back from accelerating the execution of that backlogs such as access to good labor?","John Morikis","Well, labor is clearly a piece of that. No question about it. And I think the first the projects aren't going to go away. I mean it's a robust bidding market right now. So there's a great deal of confidence on the part of our customers and I'd say to your point about the labor, we look at this as the opportunity for us to shine to our customers as they get under more pressure to serve their customers, the model that we have, the products that we have, the service that we provide, the alignment that we can reach with our customers becomes more valuable to those customers. So, our opportunity to help them to be more successful, so while it's a challenge for many of our customers from the volume standpoint they become more dependent on us and we like that, we like to demonstrate what we can do and how we can help them be more successful.","Steve Byrne","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Nishu Sood","Thank you. Thinking about the sales outlook for the year the 4% to 7% with 2% in the first quarter and between 2% and 5%, I understand obviously there's some comps issue in the later start to the painting season. You mentioned the backlogs obviously in the prior question earlier in your comments obviously is giving you confidence, what else can you kind of describe for us in terms of what gives you the confidence to get to that 4% to 7% range for the year? For example, trends in April has the construction season gotten off to a more robust start with the later start, perhaps later in March. Just if you could kind of give us a little bit more color please on the outlook?","John Morikis","Hey, Nishu. The start to April is in line with the sales guidance we gave and we talked about 2% to 5% with our North American stores being not only at the high end but above the high end and we feel good about that guidance. As far as the second half, you got to remember is our first half has its toughest comps, Performance Coatings did 90 in the first quarter 11% in the second quarter, so we're going up against a 10% quarter. Our store comps were 6% to 8% last year and our second quarter and as you know our second half tailed off. So if you look at comparisons of midst almost high single-digits in the first half and low single-digits in the second half.","The other thing I would talk about some of the headwinds that we're facing in our first half will start to annualize and it's the exited business in the U.S. that will annualize, it's the Guardsman divestiture and even some of the tariff impacts that we saw on our industrial businesses. And then the final piece of that is our FX year-over-year comparison gets easier in the second half. We are basically neutral in the first half on FX last year and over 1%. And so now we're saying, we're going to be a little bit over 2% or a little bit over 2% in the first quarter. That'll be both a little bit below 2% because of seasonality but then in the second half we have easier comps. So it's a grouping of many things that goes into our confidence in the second half.","Al Mistysyn","Yes, I'd like to add to that if I could, Nishu. I think your question is a good one about the confidence of our customers and I think I'll talk about a lot of really good points there, a few others that I'd like to expand on. One is we're not waiting for things to happen here. We don't open our doors and hope people come in. We're very aggressive and active in trying to grow our business and while our customers are confident with their pipeline, we also hedge our bets and making sure that we have growth. So we've talked over the last couple of years about our share of wallet initiatives as well as our new account activity. We've been very aggressive over the first quarter, really driving those activities inside our stores. So we're excited about not only what will happen from our existing customers but the opportunity to grow in both new accounts and share of wallet start with.","Second, the investments that we're making give us a lot of confidence in new stores and new reps, new products. I mean we want to keep pushing that pipeline full of reasons for customers to continue to switch to Sherwin-Williams, we want to make it easier for our employees to be in front of those customers with something to increase the value of proposition. And then finally, if you look at the other pieces of the businesses, consumer benefits we think are strong as we get better alignment with our customers and we believe that we talk a lot about Lowe's and we're excited about that and we believe there's a lot of opportunity but there's a lot of opportunity with our other customers in those segments as well.","And on the PCG side, I mean those businesses coming together with terrific synergies in products, people, relationships, specifications. It's hard for us to look at any one piece of our business and not be excited about the balance of the year.","Nishu Sood","Got it. Thanks for all the details. Focusing in on the consumer brands group, if you factor out the Guardsman divestiture and currency the 4% call it organic sales growth you saw there and I'm not including obviously the inventory loaded in 3Q. It's the strongest quarter you've had there in a while and especially with the late start to the painting season and the weakness overseas it implies just a really nice result in North America there. Are there any one-off factors that might kind of temper the enthusiasm a little bit about the potential there, was there some reloading ahead of the spring season, just anything that might have boosted what looks like a pretty strong result in North America?","Al Mistysyn","For the most part, Nishu, no. It's hard to draw that line at the end of the quarter to say which in any one year might fall on one side of the line or the other but the way you've asked your question is much easier to answer. There's nothing that we can point to say this happened this year versus last year. We think to your point the team is executing, we're implementing a good strategy but we've still are very excited about what's ahead of us as well.","Nishu Sood","Okay, thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks, Nishu.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Haynes","Hi, this is actually Steve Haynes on for Vincent. So if you guys could maybe just elaborate a little bit more on your titanium dioxide pricing outlook this year and whether you're thinking that maybe after a sustained period of inventory destocking whether or not the coatings industry will maybe need to restock in the back half? Thanks.","John Morikis","Yes, we'll see to what extent the softness in demand over the last quarter or two has been destocking versus just a slowdown in demand particularly outside of North America. We think demand remains pretty robust in North America. It is likely the tightest TiO2 market, if you look across the regions and I think the pricing reflects that, the pricing in TiO2 has been relatively stable over the last couple of quarters. That's our expectation going forward. It's not to say that we're not going to see pricing announcements but unless you see the supply demand balance tighten meaningfully from here, I'm not sure to what extent any future pricing and announcements are going to get traction. Our outlook is stable, relatively stable pricing over the balance of the year.","Steven Haynes","Okay, thank you.","John Morikis","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","Thank you. Bob, just a question on your outlook for the architectural paint market in North America both what you saw as growth in 2018, what you think could happen in 2019 and a particular question is we've seen a lot of strength in remodeling the last few years, that appears to be slowing and I know Harvard was out recently calling for much more of a slowing in 2019. So do you agree with that outlook and if so what would be the implications for the U.S. architectural paint market and your growth?","Bob Wells","Hey, good question Don and as a reminder at where we stand right now from an industry standpoint more than 80% of gallon volume in the industry is going into the repaint markets both residential and non-residential. So it is what will drive industry volume over the foreseeable future. We think it's an oversimplification to assume that turnover is the only driver of remodeling activity, in fact if you look at all the historical drivers of U.S. remodeling activity only one and albeit an important one that is existing, home turnover has stalled over the last 12 to 18 months.","The others including aging housing stock, home value appreciation, strong employment backdrop, consumer confidence et cetera remain intact. And I'd argue a lot of those are getting stronger. The other kind of difference in this cycle is in recent years there have been some unique non-traditional factors driving demand for remodeling. For example the Baby Boomers decision at least up to this point to age in place. Baby Boomers represent about a third of owner occupied households. But over the last couple of years have accounted for about 50% of the remodeling spend. And we're not seeing that slow down at least there's no indication that that's slowing down.","As I mentioned in my previous comments on the housing market in general, the conversion of single-family rentals in vacant homes back to owner occupied and we've actually seen a reversal in the rate of home ownership, it's been declining or it's stagnant for years, now we're seeing it start to tick back up as those rental single-family rentals are being absorbed by owners. And it's important to note that the roughly three million housing units that went from rental or vacant to owner occupied over the last couple years on average are in higher disrepair than existing home transaction would generally be and therefore require more remodeling and higher spend per unit than a typical existing home transaction. And so our conclusion is absent a recession these factors are going to continue to drive growth and remodeling spend at higher rates than overall growth in the housing market. And it's true that Harvard has lowered their outlook for 2019 but we're still above 5% remodeling spend. And we also believe that you're likely to see kind of a shift away from high ticket which has been driving a lot of the remodeling spend over the last few years to lower ticket which primarily is painting and decorating.","John Morikis","Don, I would only add a couple of seconds here. We've had five years of double-digit compounded growth in our res-repaint business. We believe we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on the paint portion of that remodel opportunity in a scenario focus for us, it's likely one of the largest opportunities we have as a company. And so we're very excited about the opportunity in this space.","Don Carson","Thank you.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Don.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Mushkin","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I actually had two. First I wanted to get your thoughts on wins. I know local and regional builders and property managers are something you guys haven't focused on. So I just want an update there. And then my second question is as we look at the year to get it the high end of your plan or maybe even above what would you think would drive that? So a two-part question, thanks.","John Morikis","So, on your first piece, Scott, we talk about wins and I'm assuming talk about winning businesses what you're referencing there?","Scott Mushkin","Yes.","John Morikis","So, coming into the year, on the new residential side we've now reached 18 of the top 20 new residential builders. So that was up one of the Top 20 in the last, I think was in the late third or fourth quarter we're still pushing very hard on the large builders but we're also very focused on the regional builder and we're doing quite well there as well.","On Property Management, it's been a terrific focus of our team in the Americas Group and we're uniquely qualified here as you would expect with our platforms to distribute product and fulfill the needs of these customers on a national basis. So there's good progress there. Our numbers in the property management area are very similar in ratio of wins at the Top 20 for property management as they are in new residential.","Bob Wells","Scott, I would say to get to the high end of the range, it's really the level of North America paint stores volume, but I would also say on North America volume across consumer and Performance Coatings it's still by far the largest segment we have or geography we have, and now to dictate where we fall into the range.","Scott Mushkin","Thanks guys, appreciate it.","Bob Wells","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Leithead","Hey guys, it's Mike Leithead on for Duffy this morning. First in North America your Paint Stores, I was hoping regionally you could give us some sort of sense of the magnitude of delta between your best and worst region. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of how hit the Midwest was from a demand standpoint because of some of the weather activities there?","John Morikis","Yes, just a second to look at that here. I would say that the, well I'll say it this way that the Midwest and the Southwest were hit pretty hard in the year. The Delta, I don't know that we're going to show that from, look at each other like we don't share that information. ","Mike Leithead","Fair enough.","John Morikis","Go ahead.","Mike Leithead","And then second question just on raw materials versus volumes. It seems like most people anticipate coatings volumes to accelerate in the second half of the year. Yet raw material inflation is expected to stay relatively flat or even I think maybe potentially come down like you were saying earlier, Bob. I guess is there any concern that as demand picks up there may be inflationary pressure on raw mats or are there other factors that hold raw materials back from that?","Bob Wells","Well, first, Mike to be clear, our growth outlook for the back half of the year doesn't necessarily we're not necessarily expecting industry volume to inflect at the same rate. We think industry volume was a little subdued in the first quarter but our expectation to accelerate growth in the second quarter and especially in the back half is pertains more to our business than it does to the industry. You're absolutely right, we see a strong pickup in industry volume it's likely to tighten some markets for raw materials. That's a high quality problem.","Mike Leithead","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Bob Wells","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Bob Wells","Good morning, Arun.","Arun Viswanathan","Just on that point on the volumes. I was just curious on your comp performance in Q1 versus your own expectations and how you see that progressing through the year assuming that the comp on the volume side was in the 1% to 2% range. Could that accelerate as we go through the year, just curious given that there is been changes in Q1 to Q4, seem to be not as weak versus Q2 and Q3, in years past? Thanks.","John Morikis","Yes. Most single-digit gallon growth that we realized in our first quarter was softer than we were expecting. And, when you look at our second quarter sales guidance that 2% to 5%, and our paint stores at above that range, it tells you that we're going see accelerating volume in the second quarter and we would expect that similar cadence going up against the weaker second half.","Al Mistysyn","Got it, just in conversations with our customers, I mean they're very clear about their inability to get to that painting phase on the projects that they're on. So, these projects are there, they're eager to get to them, we expect that they will be and we're looking forward to serving them.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks, and just as a follow-up very strong margins in Consumer, the other two were a little bit, I guess later, but from your own kind of vantage point, if you do see this volume kind of improve, do you expect a material improvement in your hair margins in both segments and especially on the gross line as well? Thanks.","Al Mistysyn","Yes. I'd say and in consumer group you know part of the improvement we saw in our operating margin was good tight cost control that team has been exhibiting throughout the past year, and with realizing synergies their gross margin was actually flat year-over-year, so they had -- have had to implement pricing and as we get volume to that group I would expect margin expansion.","The level of the sequential margin expansion will depend on volume the 69 was a pretty sizable quarter, on Performance Coatings, I would say we're very happy with the progress we're making on our operating margin, our core operating margin being up 30 basis points we saw the teams make good progress on pricing, and again the synergy realization in there, and you know when you talk about it sequentially I just want to be clear -- that's a volume issue, and if you look at our sequential gross margins they were actually up. So, we're making good progress, we have a lot of confidence in our medium term operating margin targets of high teens to low 20's.","John Morikis","Yes, I'd say that the Performance Coatings Group's effort in this area of pricing and margin really has been terrific. Those prices continue to roll into the first quarter. Our efforts are going to continue throughout the year. So, to Allen's point we're pleased with the consumer side, but we're really excited about the Performance Coatings margins. We expect those to continue.","Arun Viswanathan","Great, thanks and just a quick follow-up if I can on the M&A front, having just discuss your priorities for buybacks versus M&A, have you seen any kind of bolt trans emerged that are attractive to you. And if so, which areas as being and if not what with all the excess cash against going towards buybacks? Thanks.","John Morikis","Yes, I'll take the first piece Arun. We are looking business by business and we often talk about our approach to our M&A is driven by business units. So we look by business then by geography to understand if there are voids that we should be pursuing. And to us, we're not trying to be everything to everyone everywhere. We're really determined on executing our strategy and taking a very disciplined approach to that. We have increased amount of activity, we're engaged in a number of potential targets and we're excited about the stage that we are in given the integration of our Valspar, and how some of these might be nice bolt-ons to our businesses.","Al Mistysyn","Yes, and as we talked about on our year end call, in 2019 we're getting back to our historical cadence, a capital allocation and we talked about panned out $600 million of debt, $300 million of that is long-term that comes due in June. The rest will be short-term, our CapEx will manage below 2%. As you know, we raised our dividend over 31% in the first quarter and expect that for the year and then in the first quarter we also bought back 750,000 shares of our stock for $305 million. So you look at for the first quarter, we return $410 million to our shareholders. That's a 27%increase year-over-year and you can be assured absent M&A we're going to buyback our stock.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks, Arun.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good morning. As a high level question for you regarding your first quarter sales variance, you reported 1.9%, I think the prior expectation was 2% to 6% and so in explaining that variance I think you called out the slower start in the states and challenging conditions overseas and just wondering which one of those was more important or whether they were equally important in terms of explaining the variance versus your prior expectation?","Al Mistysyn","Well, it's all a matter of which of our business leaders we're talking to. So, I would tell you that, we often talk about the store's business, star TAG as the engine of the company and so we always point to that model as a terrific model. But it truly is the engine of the company and we'd like to see that engine going a little quicker. I mentioned just earlier that, from a painting contractors perspective, getting that painting phase of many projects in the quarter was a bit of a challenge. It's a smaller quarter for us. Its a smaller quarter for our painting contractors. So I don't think that they planned for perfection in the first quarter because of the volatility in the weather. And so they still remain very confident. That gives us great confidence. And as I mentioned I think we're uniquely positioned to serve those customers. So, on the architectural side, it's very important.","On the industrial side, when we looked at the comparable there the comps in the first quarter were up 9.8% the second quarter were up a 11%. So, we're in the mid of the toughest comparison for both these businesses from a comp standpoint. Then it breaks down quite a bit down into the 4% range in the back half of the year. Meanwhile, we're continuing with our efforts and the momentum of growing our new accounts, the share wallet in on the industrial side gaining ground as well. So, architectural is important, the industrial right behind it, but all of them important in our future growth.","Kevin McCarthy","Okay. That's helpful. And then second, I want to ask you about the packaging coatings business. I think that I heard you say that it grew sales directionally. Any color with regard to volume price and the outlook for the balance of the year there would be helpful?","John Morikis","Yes, we have a terrific team in our packaging business, terrific technology, unique technology I would tell you that globally our packaging was up in the mid single-digits in and they were up in every region that we participate in. So, we've got good momentum and we feel as though this is something that's only going to continue.","Kevin McCarthy","Thank you so much.","John Morikis","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question.","John Morikis","Dmitry?","Operator","Dmitry, your line is live. You may proceed with your questions. Thank you. We'll move onto our next question which is coming from line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Speer","Thanks. I just had a few questions. First starting out with the Americas Group, can you walk through the monthly trends in the quarter and then also to speak to maybe how things are shaping up in April 4 for that overall business and TAG?","John Morikis","Yes, I think if you look at the start I'll with April. As I said earlier, it's in line with our guidance of the two to five stores being at slightly above that range. You know the first quarter, I would just say January was strong in February and March were softer.","Justin Speer","Okay. So what should we expect within that kind of the mapping of your guidance, should we expect pricing power within this business to change from that 2.5% cadence as we look to the balance of the year at 2.5. Good, good one to think about.","John Morikis","I think you know it gets a little bit better as we go forward. I mean we've talked about the effectiveness improving over a nine month period and that still holds today.","Justin Speer","And in terms of the segment margins saying and thinking about and looking to the second quarter that the idea of you being maybe at or above the high end of that at 2% to 5% growth ambition. You know the implications for the second quarter and margins for TAG, you expect that now flips the positive year-over-year as you look to 2Q and then obviously the back half is going to be probably much better, but to keep positive on a year-over-year basis.","John Morikis","Yes, it's just that way. I'm not going to start giving guidance by segment but as my earlier comments with the demand outlook and the pricing that we just talked about we expect to see margin expansion in the year.","Al Mistysyn","To reach our 13.5% increase EPS, it's baked in there. That's for sure. Sure. Okay.","Justin Speer","Flipping switching gears to the Performance Coatings business for the intermediate term plan and specific, it's a 2020 margin plan that high teens below 20% target by 2020. Yes. How much of that is under your control the pricing levers or the synergies and how much of market growth you're going to need and the reason I ask that is just I'm looking at this international market means fairly sluggish. Can you still get to that destination by 2020 from here because I think when I look at all the different businesses, this is the one that's the furthest part. So I just wanted to put that to you and see what you your thoughts are there.","Al Mistysyn","Yes. Justin, first, we're going to give you an update on our 2020 guidance at our Investor Day in June. But we believe, we have a number of factors that are in our control that help drive you to that target one. One is volume and new account growth, the product innovation that John talked about the movement and b70 on the packaging side. We still have opportunities for synergies within that group and both consumer brands with the majority of them being more focused towards Performance Coatings as we get into product reformulations and raw material changes and then we get into the facilities that we talked about earlier. So I think there's a number of things that are in our control that allow us to move towards that target, how quickly we get there is to be determined.","Justin Speer","Understood, and lastly for me in just terms of the consumer brands was there any load in benefit versus the prior year, I believe that the announcement was in February last year, we had a sizable win, a notable win, at a large customer, was there any load in benefit or tailwind year-over-year from that customer win that they graduated into the quarter?","John Morikis","Yes, I think just the normal ramping up for us as the season, I don't think there was anything dramatic or different for the most part, Justin.","Justin Speer","Let's fully annualized, I guess the energy you've anniversary at all of that tailwind, there's no more to come going forward in terms of just the apples and oranges benefit from that customer win.","John Morikis","No, I'd say that we from an annualized Asian standpoint, we had a little bit coming and in Q2, the lion's share of it will be in Q3 from a comparison standpoint.","Justin Speer","Okay, perfect. Perfect. Okay. Well thank you very much appreciate it.","John Morikis","Thanks, Justin.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Dimitri Silverstein with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question. Dimitri your line is live.","Dimitri Silverstein","Did you hear me now?","John Morikis","Yes, Dimitri.","Dimitri Silverstein","All right, perfect. Thank you. Stick my call again. I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of sort of items outstanding. First of all in your Americas business your Latin American group given the high teens declines in foreign exchange, was that - was that a positive operating performance quarter for the group or not so much?","John Morikis","But the top line and bottom line would have been diliutive.","Dimitri Silverstein","So you lost all the money on the EBIT line there as well. Okay. I'm just trying to understand that the old paint store group and seeing how well it thought it did? Secondly in terms of European and Asia-Pacific demand environment particularly for the industrial part of the business short of comps getting easier in the back end of the year is there anything that you can see or are seeing or can point to in other words what would it take for it for the results there to get better at a macro level and what is it that you're doing in addition to that to make sure you deliver the growth that you expect to deliver in the back end of the year?","John Morikis","Yes. You're talking about specifically Europe with this question to me Dimitri?","Dimitri Silverstein","Europe and Asia Pacific.","John Morikis","Yes. Okay sure. Yes. So in Europe you're right, overall there was some softness there as I mentioned we did see packaging up in every region so they were up and in Europe, and we believe in Europe, we have some really terrific teams that are coming together in our general industrial and our industrial wood businesses, as well as our protective and marine capabilities. So, our goal there is to really start capitalizing on the combined company and the synergies that result from these two companies coming together. I have mentioned earlier about some of the synergies, some of that comes in the way of cost savings but we're also anxious to do is to begin transferring the technology over there and that's beginning now, but it certainly offers a terrific opportunity going forward.","In Asia, again overall a soft market, some of that was the result of the implications of trade where we saw our industrial wood business under tremendous pressure as more and more companies grappled with the impacts of the implications of the trade issues. Again our packaging business was up our coil were up it was up in both of those were actually up in double digit in Asia. So, good performance there. Our general industrial offers opportunity there. We're anxious to capitalize on but we do think the industrial was going to be under some pressure for some time given everything that's going on.","Dimitri Silverstein","Okay. So it sounds like in you're definitely not looking for any kind of a macro pick up. It's basically entirely sort of self-help and in terms of Asia Pacific that the macro environment you're not optimistic at all it sounds like.","John Morikis","I think, in all these markets, with our market share position, I mean we've got terrific opportunities. Yes. We'd like to see the markets improve. But in an odd way those grinding markets should position us to do even better and we like a grind. We like the opportunity to get in and show that what we bring in solutions and products and services are differentiated. So, if the market comes that's great. If not our teams know our expectations of them. We want to grow.","Dimitri Silverstein","Great. That's a very good answer. Thank you for that information. The last question, just the North American market given the little bit of a slow start weather or otherwise in the paint business, I noticed particularly in Asia there seems to be a little bit more promotional activity, as you look across here your distribution channels are you having to be a little bit more promotional this year or is it basically, business as usual and there's no incremental promotions that are needed to get the volume up. ","John Morikis","No. I don't think that there's any significant difference in the promotional activity that's taking place right now. We're certainly we don't feel as though that's necessary.","Dimitri Silverstein","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks, Dimitri.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Garik Shmois","Thanks, and thanks for taking my question. I just want to clarify on the volume ramp, the rest of the year. There's a comment that was made that you expect to outpace the industry. Just want to be clear. Is this a broad based comment across businesses or is this targeting TAG in particular.","John Morikis","Well, we certainly believe that our TAG business is positioned to outpace the market. We've talked about that for many years and you know the fact this year that we've got the new stores, new products everything that we have going. We're really excited about this year's season, in fact not only just everything from a investment and resource standpoint but the activity that our teams have demonstrated in this additional area that we've talked about and I think may not be valued as much as we value by some of our investors which is the new account activity and share of wallet.","So, we absolutely see a terrific ramp to outpace the market in our stores business outside of that. When you say you know is it just limited to our stores. I jokingly made the comment earlier, it depends on who inside our company we're talking to, but I say that tongue in cheek because the reality is when we sit and talk with every one of our businesses and we review the opportunities, it really is very exciting to talk about some of the things that were on the verge on the line trials that were on the promotional or the programs that we're working on with our customers. So, we think we have a foot in the right direction and every one of these businesses and that's not to say there won't be challenges but we feel really good about where we are and where we're headed.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Thanks. And my follow-up question is just as you think of the new store openings going from 15 in Q1 to the 90 to 100 for the full-year. How should that track the rest of the way, and are there any support costs or staffing costs that can be lumpy that we should be aware of?","John Morikis","Yes. For the many years, we've been opening stores that at 90 to 100. We opened 15 in the first quarter and then we'll open 35ish in the fourth quarter and the rest time that we are in the second and third quarters - third and fourth and there's no lumpiness to that to the expense that you would expect.","Garik Shmois","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks, Garik.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.","Chuck Cerankosky","Good morning, everyone.","John Morikis","Good morning, Chuck.","Chuck Cerankosky","I want to switch subject a little bit. The deferred pension asset dropped more than $200 year over year. And Al could you give us the implications what that means to earnings per share and cash flows going forward and even what happened in cash flows in the first quarter as well as the annuities were purchased and how it impacted the financial statements please.","Al Mistysyn","Sure, the annuity purchase came out, the defined benefit plans. It did not impact the net operating cash that were reported. That really was the net operating cash impact was really an increase in our working capital and primarily architectural inventory to get ready for the spring selling season to make sure, we're servicing our customers at a very, very high level.","The impact of the pension settlement and the annuity, we took $32.4 million over hit, that's in other income and expense if it allowed us to monetize the over-funded pension plan that we had and it's a little over the $200 million in cash that we now have available to us to fund our defined contribution pension plan in which we use $65 million in the February to fund that contribution. So going forward, that are losses another good, three or four years, where instead of the company having to outlay cash, we'll use that money that came out of that VB plan.","Chuck Cerankosky","All right. Great, thank. If any way to put Al an annual EPS number on that, would it benefits?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, we haven't, Chuck. I mean it's not material it's baked into our guidance and not material year-over-year to call out. So we didn't.","Chuck Cerankosky","Thank you, best of luck with the rest of 2019.","Al Mistysyn","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks, Chuck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","PJ Juvekar","Yes, thank you for taking my question. When you look at your business, how much of your paint is order online and who is ordering online? Is it mostly contractors or DIY customers? Can you just talk about sort of online purchases of paint?","John Morikis","I think that's a relatively small percentage of our purchases and it's nearly all professional contractors that are using that. We do have P.J. a program that's continuing to ramp up in the area this e-commerce to allow customers to do more business with us. You see areas that we're testing in different parts of the country and we would expect over the not too distant future to conduct more business over the Internet but we don't want to - we want to enhance. We don't replace our stores. We want to enhance the service and the capabilities of our stores and our reps through e-commerce. And we believe this is going to be a terrific tool to allow our customers to get the most out of the resources that we bring to the table.","PJ Juvekar","Okay, thank you. Would you say it's less than 5% today?","John Morikis","Yes.","PJ Juvekar","Okay. And then one last question, you didn't talk much about the vast postindustrial business particularly the big machinery business with Cat and Deer. I was wondering what's going on in that business and what trends you are seeing? Thank you.","John Morikis","Inside the questions -- I'd say overall our business there is doing well, we again have a lot of respect for these customers we're working hard to bring more solutions to them. I'd say this was an area that when you look at the combination of our companies both technical organizations we're working on opportunities to enhance features of the product to help our customers, one company had solved one area of an issue and the other one had supplied another and when we got our technical teams together we've really found an opportunity to enhance what we believe to be is a terrific solution for those customers but also that might be expandable into other areas as well. So, it's an exciting part of our business one that we expect to continue to grow.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks, P.J.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Gregory Mallett with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Gregory Mallett","Hi, thanks, some try and keep it brief. Just want to make sure I got the pricing dynamic right. It's 2.5% was the pricing mix in the Americas group comp, if we looked at Performance Coatings, should we assume that the price realized was something north of that maybe 3.5% or 4%, if my back out math is correct and I had a follow-up for Al.","Al Mistysyn","Greg, I would say the way that pricing rolls in is more choppy than our stores, that I talked about, and I would say it's not quite that high.","Gregory Mallett","Yes, but it wouldn't be - it would be higher than I'm just looking at the math, if I had back the FX for North America to grown 4%, there must have been more price in Performance Coatings than in America's Group?","Al Mistysyn","I would say it's similar amount and our volume was up low single-digits in Performance Coatings.","Gregory Mallett","Yes, I feel that I was looking for. And then second on the guidance for the full-year, could you remind us what the tax rates you guys are using for that, at the midpoint or in a range. And then link that to the buyback as well. I mean you have more buyback than we had at least in the first quarter? Do you look at that 300 million this first quarter sort of a new higher level of run rate or just given where the share price was more opportunistic, if you think about the full-year?","Al Mistysyn","Yes. The tax rate, tucker the core tax rate we expect to be in the low 20%. Obviously, we're a little bit lower than that, in the first quarter but comparable with last year because of the favorable impact you get on Scott comp is heavier in the first quarter, just historically there's been more options exercised than you, we have some vesting of our issues.","As far as the share buyback, I think, you know we are going to be opportunistic and we were in the first quarter with where we saw our stock price. I think you had done the math free cash flow in our last call and got a little bit higher, directionally than I would have been. I think your number was 800 to 1 billion. So I might be a little bit lower than that but it's going to depend on the M&A activity and how that unfolds throughout the year that will determine how much we ultimately buy.","Gregory Mallett","So, it sounds like for purposes of guidance you're still assuming maybe a couple million shares for the year not 3 million or 4 million.","Al Mistysyn","That's fair. Okay.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks a lot. Good luck guys. Thanks.","John Morikis","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Eric, your line is live. You may proceed with your question.","Thank you. We will move on to our next question which is coming in the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please with your question.","Mike Harrison","Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask a couple of questions on the Lowe's business specifically about the bottom line contribution that you saw in Q1 and what you're expecting in Q2. Can you just talk about how that played out compared to your expectations and in are the costs related to that Lowe's business where you want them at this point?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Mike, out of respect for all our customers we don't want to comment on any individual customer impact on our results. Now, as far as the costs go we did lay out the fact that we were going to take a $50 million charge in about 40% of that was one time. So, that remaining 30 million if you will spread pretty evenly out through the fourth quarter that '19.","Mike Harrison","All right, and then one of your competitors that serves the DIY market sounded a little bit more optimistic about trends in DIY. Wondering if you share that view and if so what do you think is generating some of that improvement.","John Morikis","Well, we're certainly positive about the space we think that they mentioned earlier you know working with our partners to drive their success is important. Our view is that we're providing customers the brands and the quality of product that can help separate them from our or align them with their customers. I will say that during that process, we always are making sure that we have the right relationships and that we're in the right channels and with the right assortments, with the right customers. So that review is something that's ongoing and something that we work very hard on. Once those decisions are made and we work really hard to align ourselves and put our customers in the best position to win.","Mike Harrison","All right. And last question I had, I was just wondering John if you can comment on the recent personnel changes. I know you promoted David Sewell to COO and then made some changes at the top of Performance Coatings and consumer. Is this just moving people up the ladder or does it suggest some more significant changes going on strategically at the top of those two segments?","John Morikis","No, I think if you look historically Mike at the company, I think it's 27 over the last 32 years we've had a Chief Operating Officer. The company is we have strong expectations and we want to grow, we want to grow fast and I believe David Sewell is a wonderful, talented leader that can help us accomplish our goals. Aaron Erter into our Performance Coatings is I think a tribute to the commitment that we have in identifying talent and making sure that they have the experiences to continue to develop. Rob Lynch backfilling Aaron Erter I mean I go down the list, I mean we work really hard at developing a strong depth of talent to be able to execute what it is that we're trying to do. But what we're trying to do is grow and my belief in having a COO is specifically targeted at helping us to drive our business with more speed.","Mike Harrison","All right, thanks very much.","John Morikis","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with G Research. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the refinishing. Could you give us some details on the trends whether it is in North America and in international markets?","John Morikis","I'd say refinishing in North America, Rosemarie was a relatively soft market and I'd say that that we are kind of floating right with the market and that doesn't bode well for us as you would expect. Our expectations for our teams are not to run with the market. So we feel as though we're positioned well, we've got some new technology that we think can help to expedite the efforts that we have. We've got -- it's oddly enough another opportunity of the synergies of the two companies come together. We have an Ultra K, Ultra 9K technology that's waterborne technology that we believe is a wonderful quality product, great color helps in productivity all the levers that you would look at for vehicle refinish. And so while our performance in the first quarter reflected kind of what we see in the market not only in North America, I would say around the world for the most part. Our expectations for this team going forward will be to outperform the market. We feel we're holding our own. I guess would be the answer.","Rosemarie Morbelli","So with everyone texting and teenagers doing all of that at the wheel of a car, why do you think the demand is so slow, I am assuming you are counting on accidents in order to grow that particular business?","John Morikis","Well, we don't like when you frame it exactly that way. But there are distracted drivers that certainly have some impact on it. I'd say that there's a general softness in the market and we're we believe that there are opportunities for this business. So overall I think collisions industry wide were down in the low single-digits but again when I look at our market share opportunities, there are growth opportunities for us and that's what we're working with our teams to capture.","Rosemarie Morbelli","So even with AI causing costs to stop by itself even if someone is distracted at the wheel, you still think that with the market decline you can still gain share and growth?","John Morikis","No, and part of that comes back to what I talked about earlier as far as the technology, all of this creates pressure in a segment. And that pressure forces people to find better solutions to what it is that they're trying to do. There are going to be some accidents out there. And so if you look at the opportunity to help those customers whose business might be under pressure because of everything that you've just described, those customers are going to be looking for solutions that help them do their what they want to do more profitably. We think we can help our customers accomplish that goal by bringing in the solutions to win.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay, that is very helpful. And if I could just have one last question in terms of China and the demand which obviously had slowed down because of tariffs but seems to be picking up in terms of domestic demand. Would that be helping, are you seeing it first of all and is it mostly in your wood business that you would see it, if it is now growing?","John Morikis","Well, part of that has to do with the focus of our business as I would say that we're looking more into that domestic business Rosemarie, but it's not been the primary area of our focus. So while we're looking to grow in those areas that speaks more to the point, I made earlier about the fact that given our market share and the opportunities to grow that we need to always be looking for those opportunities regardless of what's happened in the market. We've not been traditionally solely focused on one area but we've been more focused on the export of products than we have been the domestic market. And so that gives us a terrific opportunity to grow forward in the future.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you very much.","John Morikis","Thanks, Rosemarie.","Operator","Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.","Bob Wells","Thank you, Jessie.

In order to allow more time to questions, we\u2019ve provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website sherwin.com under Investor Relations First Quarter Press Release.","Summarizing overall company performance for the first quarter 2014 versus first quarter 2013, consolidated net sales increased 9.2% to a record $2.37 billion, due primarily to higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and acquisitions. Acquisitions increased net sales 4.5% in the quarter and unfavorable currency exchange decreased consolidated net sales 1.9%.","Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $103.1 million for the quarter to $1,065.9 million. Gross margin increased 60 basis points to 45% of sales from 44.4% in the first quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $105.4 million over first quarter last year to $884.1 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 37.4% in the first quarter this year from 35.9% last year. Interest expense increased $1.1 million compared to the first quarter last year to $16.4 million, consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $2.3 million to $166.1 million due primarily to the loss from acquisitions and unfavorable currency translations.","Acquisitions and unfavorable currency reduced net income in the quarter by $19.2 million and $5.3 million respectively. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter this year was 30.5% compared to 31% in the first quarter of 2013. For full year 2014, we expect our effective tax rate will be in the low 30% range compared to last year\u2019s rate of 30.7%.","Consolidated net income decreased $728,000 to $115.5 million, net income as a percent of sales was 4.9% compared to 5.4% in the first quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased to $1.14 per share from $1.11 per share in 2013.","Looking at our results by operating segments, sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2014 increased 16.4% to $1.36 billion from $1.17 billion last year. Comparable store sales or sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months increased 7.9%. More than half of the Paint Stores Group\u2019s sales increase was due to higher organic paint and equipment sales volumes across all end markets. Acquisitions increased net sales $7.2% for the segment. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter. Regionally in the first quarter, our Southwestern division led all divisions followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in all four divisions.","Segment profit for the group increased $16.6 million or 12.8% to $146.3 million in the quarter as higher paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by the loss from acquisitions and higher SG&A spending. Acquisitions reduced segment profit to $16.7 million in the quarter. Segment operating margin including acquisitions decreased to 10.8% of sales from 11.1% in the first quarter last year.","Turning to the consumer group, first quarter sales increased 5.4% to $325.3 million due primarily to acquisitions and the timing of seasonal shipments to some customers. Acquisitions increased net sales 3.9% in the quarter. Segment profit for the consumer group decreased $2.9 million to $51.1 million in the quarter from $54 million in the first quarter last year. Profit was negatively impacted by higher distribution costs to maintain service levels and by a loss from acquisitions. Acquisitions reduced segment profit $600,000 in the quarter. Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 15.7% from 17.5% in the same period last year.","For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 2.2% to $497.6 million in the quarter due to primarily to selling price increases partially offset by lower paint sales volumes and unfavorable currency translations. Unfavorable currency decreased net sales for the segment 1.6% in the quarter.","First quarter segment profit stated in U.S. dollars increased $12.6 million or 37% to $46.5 million due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and selling price increases. Unfavorable currency translation reduced segment profit $1.8 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 9.3% from 7% in the same period last year.","For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales decreased 10% to $182.4 million due to unfavorable currency translation and lower paint sales volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases.","Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 16.5% in the quarter. Stated in U.S. dollars, segment profit in the quarter decreased to $10 million from $20.8 million last year. Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation and lower year-over-year sales volumes. Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit $3.8 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 5.5% in the first quarter compared to 10.3% in the same quarter last year.","Turning to our balance sheet, our total debt on March 31, 2014 was $1.71 billion including short-term borrowings of $87.4 million. Total debt on March 31st last year was $1.7 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $366.5 million compared to $613.9 million at the end of the first quarter 2013.","In the first quarter 2014, we spent $29.4 million on capital expenditure, depreciation expense was $41.4 million and amortization expense was $7.6 million. For the full year 2014, we anticipate capital expenditures will be approximately $190 million to $200 million; depreciation will be about $170 million and amortization approximately $30 million.","I'll conclude this review with a brief update on the status of our Lead Litigation. In the Santa Clara County case involving public nuisance claims brought by 10 California cities and counties against 5 defendant companies, judge Kleinberg entered his final judgment on January 27th. From this final judgment Sherwin-Williams, NL Industries and ConAgra filed motions with the trial court for a new trial and to vacate the judgment. Following briefing and argument on those motions, they were denied on March 25th. Our notice of appeal was filed on March 28th. The record has not yet been transmitted to the court of appeals nor has a briefing schedule been set. We continue to believe a decision by the court of appeals will take approximately two to three years.","That concludes our review of first quarter results for 2014, so I will turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. Chris?","Chris Connor","","Thank you, Bob. Good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us today. Before I comment on the quarter, let me take a few minutes to summarize where we stand with respect to the Comex Mexico acquisition.","As you know, March 31st was the date after which either parties could terminate the purchase agreement without cause. Throughout the month of March, Sherwin-Williams worked closely with Comex and the Mexican competition commission in an effort to secure approval to complete the transaction. We presented a detailed remedy proposal to the commission and as of the end of the month, they had not ruled on our remedy.","On April 1st, the seller notified us that they believe we breached our obligation to use all commercially reasonable efforts to secure regulatory approval in Mexico. In response to this notification on April 3rd, we filed a complaint to the New York State Court, seeking a judgment that we are not in breach and we notified Comex that we terminated the purchase agreement.","This action was entirely defensive on our part. We could not allow an allegation and breach sustain without an appropriate response. At this point, we do not know how long this legal process will take, but both parties agreeing the termination is final and we\u2019re moving on.","After 18 months of effort behind this acquisition, it is an understatement to say that we\u2019re disappointed with the conclusion. On a positive note, the portion of the transaction we did complete, 306 company operated paint stores and 8 manufacturing sites in United States and Canada are on track to deliver outstanding returns to our shareholders over a relatively short timeframe.","During the quarter, we made good progress in our efforts to integrate this business into our existing paint stores platform and supply chain operations. We announced the consolidation of four manufacturing and distribution facilities and the headquarters building. On March 1st, all of U.S. store locations converted to The Sherwin-Williams point of sale system, which will significantly improve store operations including color matching and inventory management.","The Canadian stores will convert to this POS platform in May. As a result, product availability has improved dramatically in these stores and our field management teams are working closely together on product cross training and improving territory coverage.","Our first quarter guidance included acquisition dilution in the range of $0.15 to $0.25 per share for the Comex acquisition. Actual dilution of $0.12 per share reflects the budgeted amount of one-time integration cost and better than expected operating results for these stores in the quarter.","Our core business is also off to a good start. If you back out the impact of the acquisition, consolidated sales grew 4.7% in the quarter and profit before tax increased 10%. As a percent of sales, operating profit and profit before tax increased 30 basis points and 40 basis points respectively. Even with dilution from the acquisition, our consolidated gross margin increased year-over-year for the eighth consecutive quarter. The lion\u2019s share of this improvement came from our Paint Stores Group. Organic sales grew 9.2%, operating profit without acquisitions increased 25%, and core operating margins increased 160 basis points. Incremental margin on the core business was 30%.","During the quarter, Paint Stores Group added 17 net new stores and our plan calls for a full year store openings in the range of 80 to 90 net new locations. Today our total score count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 3,925 stores compared to 3,529 one year ago. This year-over-year increase in store locations, both organic and acquired along with the investments we made in store and territory staffing in the back half of last year, resulted in 80 basis point increase in segment SG&A as a percent of sales. Without the acquisitions, SG&A as a percent of sales decrease 10 basis points in the quarter.","Consumer Group got off to a respectable start from a revenue respective with organic sales up 1.6% in the quarter but the harsh winter weather over the first two months of the year, disruptive raw material deliveries that made it difficult to move finished goods across the northern half of the country and the cases of southern half for that matter.","This drove supply chain cost up, resulting in negative flow-through for the group in the quarter. Sales momentum remained strong in the domestic paint and coatings market, particularly in the contractor segment. And Europe is showing early signs of recovery but economic conditions in Latin America have continued to deteriorate. Both our Global Finishes Group and Latin American Coatings Group felt the impact of currency devaluation and weakening market conditions throughout this region. While Global Finishes Group was able to offset the drag from Latin America with growth in other regions, our results in Latin America Coatings Group reflected the impact of soft demand in currency in the quarter and we expect these conditions to persist over the balance of the year.","Our ongoing efforts to improve working capital efficiency continue to bear fruit. Working capital decreased as a percentage of sales to 11% from 11.7% in the first quarter last year. If you back out the effect of the acquisition, working capital sales would have been 10.4% at quarter end.","The reduction in working capital more than offset the incremental cash used for integration activities in the quarter. As a result, net operating cash in the quarter improved by approximately $8 million compared to our first quarter cash performance last year.","During the quarter, we acquired 1.3 million shares of the company stock with treasury at an average cost of a $197.22 for a total investment of $256.4 million.","On March 31, we had remaining authorizations to acquire 10.85 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, up from $0.50 last year.","We remain optimistic that U.S. residential demand for architectural paint strengthen as we get into the prime painting season, we\u2019re encouraged by early signs of a more robust commercial recovery. This growth will be offset to some degree by challenging conditions in Latin America.","Our outlook for second quarter 2014 is for consolidated net sales to increase 8% to 14% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter in the range of $2.80 to $3 per share compared to last year\u2019s record $2.46 per share.","This guidance includes our expectations; the U.S. and Canadian stores acquired from Comex will increase net sales by $125 million to $135 million and reduce diluted net income per common share by approximately $0.10 per share in the second quarter.","For the full year 2014, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2013 by 8% to 13%. With annual sales at that level, we are reaffirming our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $8.12 to $8.32 per share compared to $7.26 per share earned in 2013.","This annual guidance includes our expectation that the Comex stores will increase net sales by a low single-digit percentage in the year and reduce diluted net income per common share by approximately $0.45 to $0.55 per share in the full year of 2014.","Again, thanks to all of you for being with us this morning on the call. And now we would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning.","Chris Connor","Good morning Bob.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Chris I don\u2019t want to steal your [thunder] from your meeting here in a month or so, but I am just wondering as you guys look at your ability to continue to get some price and lever the store base, can you give us some sense of where the goals are on the gross margin line? And then do you think it\u2019s possible to leverage your SG&A, the sales a little bit more aggressively and maybe get it closer to 32% level for [annual] basis you had during the housing boom?","Chris Connor","Thanks Bob. Yes, we will be talking about all those topics when we come to see the entire investment community in New York next month. And specifically to your question on price in SG&A, as you know we did comment in the last quarter call that we did take price to the market in the first quarter. Those price increases are going in I think typically [good] for us, so nothing to report there out of the ordinary.","As you know, we\u2019ve given guidance which is somewhat unusual for us that our gross margin this year will come in probably in the 45.5% to 46% range, up from 45.3%. So you can read into that that the price effect is taking place and holding and delivering the expected results.","And I think the SG&A numbers are going to be a little bit cloudy this year. As we\u2019ve pointed out, the jump on that is almost 100% attributable to the acquisition rolling in. When we back that out for example and start we\u2019re seeing SG&A leverage, we would expect that the year goes on to continue to see that SG&A leverage as sales ramp up.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","And then if I may, you mentioned the price in the store base, can you talk about price to the consumer channel and obviously that takes a little more conservative effort with your channel partners. Does that likely to be as robust not as robust not at all, should we see that development through the year?","Chris Connor","Bob it also has been our practice, we haven\u2019t commented on pricing activity so much outside of the stores organization. We\u2019d basically just kind of give you a sense of where we\u2019re managing that inside that platform; we tend to keep those discussions confidential so nothing comment on pricing outside of the stores\u2019 organization today.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","","All right, (inaudible) thanks Chris.","Chris Connor","Good efforts, thanks Bob.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Great, thanks for taking my questions. So a question with regard to Comex U.S., it sounds like the revenues are coming in maybe better than you expected and certainly the dilution in the first quarter was a lot lower than what you were looking for. And you have maintained the full year expected dilution in that $0.45 to $0.55 range. So I guess I\u2019m wondering, what may be got pushed out or if there is some chunkiness too with it that maybe we need to think about or is it just kind of conservative outlook in terms of what the dilution maybe for the year?","Sean Hennessy","This is Sean Hennessy, great question. When we take a look at the first quarter, yes sales were slightly above what we had thought, but the loss was dramatically lower. And we were talking on the first, three months ago when we reported the full year that we thought that 60% of the loss in 2014 would be coming from one time only and 40% would be operational.","This quarter it was 80% operational and 20% one-time. So you can see the one time hit did not occur in the first quarter. And I like your word, the quarter is little bit choppy because as Chris mentioned, we have announced four, not all the hits have occurred into the real life due to those closings.","So, as those come in, it\u2019s a little choppy trying to determine exactly which quarter those will come in. But we still feel that this time we\u2019re going to say with the guidance for the year on both the $0.45 to $0.55 and the $0.60, $0.40.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. No, fair enough. And then just one last question, on the non-residential construction side, can you walk us through maybe what you're seeing in the markets there, I know there are some expectations that things are starting to warm up. But have you started to see it? And what are you seeing there?","Bob Wells","Yes John, this is Bob. We look at published data sources just like everyone else and it\u2019s been somewhat mixed in recent month. The one benefit of controlled distribution is that we get timely robust feedback from our contractor customers and a lot of this feedback lately has been about bidding activity and order volume. And sufficed to say commercial contractors are clearly busier and more optimistic than they were this time last year.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Great. Thanks very much for the color.","Chris Connor","Thank you John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Hey guys, good morning.","Chris Connor","Good morning Ghansham.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Hey, you call that the weather impact in the consumer side from a manufacturing perspective, what about the Paint Stores business as a whole in terms of feedback from your customers. Does that have any impact on your same-store sales, does it still very solid. But just curious as to what your customers\u2019 feedback was?","Chris Connor","Yes Ghansham, as the quarter unfold and we certainly had days and weeks of rough weather in certain geographies. I think the interesting impact was we can certainly see that in our daily sales reports. But typically that buy would rebound relatively quickly. So when we did have good weather, we\u2019d have strong days in the back side of that. And the kinds of projects that we\u2019re involved with these products typically don't get deferred if you miss the painting window in February, because store is closed or traffic system -- contractors can't get to job site, doesn't tend to get delay for quarters or years, it gets right back on it. So certainly, we had some days, so we were low on revenue but overall I think the quarter was pretty steady in terms of the demand that we saw.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","","So Chris, just to kind of take that one step further and just kind of comment on North American housing as a whole from your perspective, do you see any material change just given the increase that people talk about in interest rates and home prices and the potential impact on housing, are you seeing any impact from that whatsoever?","Bob Wells","","Johnson, this is Bob again. The March housing starts and permits were released yesterday and it was interesting although the top-line was considered a bit of a miss versus consensus. Single family starts were really solid, they were up 6%. We think that\u2019s the sign of latest strength in the market and we also believe that inventory levels of both new and existing homes are well below where they should be at this point in time if there is any pickup in rate of sales in the spring, they are going to be building. We do not believe that interest rates are significantly affecting affordability, so we would expect some pick up in the rate of sales in the spring.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much.","Chris Connor","","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of P. J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Jester - Citigroup","Good morning. It\u2019s Dan Jester on for P.J.","Chris Connor","","Hi Dan.","Dan Jester - Citigroup","","In Latin America, is the weakness that you are seeing uniform across all the end markets, or are there differences in architectural protective, marine and sort of your product finishes businesses?","Chris Connor","","So geographically Dan, the weaknesses unfortunately are on two biggest economies Brazil and Mexico, architectural and both of those categories is probably leading the weakness but we are also not seeing much pick up in the protective and marine segments either. So pretty soft market conditions in both of those economies. And then of course as we commented throughout currency in both places is not helping either.","Dan Jester - Citigroup","Okay. And then on your U.S. store count, it\u2019s typically I think you\u2019re back-end loaded in terms of the opening but 17 stores has been a lot more even you had in the first quarter over the last couple of years. So, are you doing anything different in terms of your store openings?","Chris Connor","Yes. That\u2019s insightful comment, you\u2019re absolutely correct. In fact when we kind of look at the rolling 12 month new store count were up 95 net new stores this quarter part and parcel that SG&A kind of moving a little bit in the wrong direction as we get excited about the coming demand and getting on top of it. This is actually the preferred path for us. We would rather not be so back-end loaded on new store openings. We don\u2019t control that as much as the municipalities and the building permit cycle that developers face trying to get these retail stores open. So, I think this is nothing more than the start just aligning a little better performance, getting these stores open. And as we commented, we\u2019re pretty much on target here to get this 80 to 90 store count in this year.","Dan Jester - Citigroup","Great, thank you.","Chris Connor","Thanks Dan.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Thank you. And good morning everyone. You called out raw materials in Latin America and kind of didn\u2019t mention anywhere else. So was it just that you couldn\u2019t price it down there or did you actually see inflation everywhere else or what is your outlook?","Chris Connor","Raw material comment in Latin America is that so much of that raw material based on there is U.S. dollar denominated. So our raw is relatively flat and benign everywhere including Latin America, it\u2019s the local currency conversion rate that\u2019s the headwind for those guys.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And just a follow-up, can I just ask you about share repurchases and with Comex Mexico not going to happen now, should we anticipate you making a lot of progress towards the remaining authorization over the balance of the year?","Sean Hennessy","I think that if you take a look at the long term history of company, we believe that we like to run the company at a one-time term debt to EBITDA. I think that we\u2019ve been higher than that as well as we don\u2019t believe in holding cash. And we\u2019ve been -- have cash balances all the way up to $800 million to $900 million. So now that -- and we held that for the Comex Mexico, so that we have a proper liquidity at closing. I think over the next period of time, you are going to see us get back to those metrics. So I would tell you void of an acquisition, you are going to see us buyback stock.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. That sounds great. I will pass along.","Chris Connor","","Thanks Vince.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Thanks, good morning. I appreciate the call. Can you spend a little time talking to us about the DIY part of the market? I know you guys have gone ahead with the [perks] program, wondering if it\u2019s kind of a strong emphasis for you. And also on the DIY, so curious what your consumers, your customers on the consumer side of the business you\u2019re doing with inventory, whether they\u2019re kind of pulling it in or send it back?","Chris Connor","Yes. So the DIY business there, I mean it\u2019s always been an important part of our marketing platform here and through our stores organization continues to be something we\u2019re trying to build. To put it in perspective, our business ratio through those neighborhood network of paint stores is about 85% professional, 15% DIY. So while an important segment, it\u2019s fairly de minimis compared to the contractor focus . I wouldn\u2019t characterize that a DIY program so much as a [perk] program, we do have a preferred customer arrangement that we build up by just capturing customer\u2019s email contact information and clearly doing a much better job of connecting with them on a very digital format that are available to us. As we\u2019ve said repeatedly now for I think the last 2.5 years, our DIY sales have been terrific, they have been outpacing the market and slowly gaining a little share. And as a result of that, we\u2019re pretty pleased with that performance. We give some credit to our relationship with HGTV, which has been a terrific relationship with the company attracting a younger consumer to us.","In terms of our Consumer Group customers and their exposure to the DIY market and whether or not they are adjusting inventory, I would expect the answer has to be no. I mean most of these folks are very sophisticated, retailers have great systems in place, much as we talked about working capital management and the systems we put into help us manage that. I think they are doing the same.","So, long gone the days where inventories spike up and down based on some kind of a term being offered et cetera. So, I think they are in pretty good inventory shape and we would expect it to season ramps up, so (inaudible) purchase this.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Chris, can you also just clarify on price realization for the increase you took earlier in the quarter? Can you just remind us kind of how that price realization is going and you mentioned pricing mix didn\u2019t have much of an impact on Q1 but how we should think about that for the next few quarters would be great?","Sean Hennessy","And again, this is Sean. But, we feel pretty good about our price realization and that\u2019s why when you see the gross margins up $0.06 for the first quarter. And I think earlier this call, Chris again reaffirmed that the gross margin forecast we have 45.5 to 46 versus last year\u2019s 45.3, we\u2019re not changing that. So, we feel the realization has been good.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Okay, thanks guys. I appreciate it.","Chris Connor","Thank you, Aram.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","Hey good morning.","Chris Connor","Good morning, Trey.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","Back on the pricing just to follow-up on that so you are seeing good pricing realization, but the addition of Comex\u2019s 300 plus stores, is that going to impact the roll out or implementation of pricing at all as we look through this year and what\u2019s the timing?","Chris Connor","The answer to that is yes, and I think that\u2019s why we really changed what we did for pricing this year versus in the past. We used to give you a percentage and a date and because this was an integration between just not only the core, but really five different businesses that needed to be integrated. There was going to be some timing different and that\u2019s why we switched from giving you a date and a percentage that we are going out, an effective rate that we saw that we are going to eventually achieve. We went to a gross margin forecast where we went from 45.5 to 46. And those were the reasons why, those are part of the reason why is because what you just referred to.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","Okay. That makes sense. And then on the cost front, you mentioned not seeing any real raw material inflation. But can you speak specifically, I know at one point maybe late last year you guys thought that there was that we could see or there was possibly the potential for some modest TiO2 inflation this year. Has that outlook changed, since we are not really seeing much yet? And if not, could you kind of give us some ideas of your thoughts around that?","Bob Wells","Yes Trey, this is Bob. We think for the first quarter specifically for the industry raw material inflation across the entire basket was likely flat to very low single-digits. Any year-over-year change in the quarter was most likely from plastic packaging due to as we referred to in the last call the run-up in the high density polyethylene and also monomer and polymer pricing might have been a little inflationary due to higher energy cost in the quarter.","TiO2 still remains the moderate risk for the back half, it has not moved in the first half of the year. But even if it does move, it\u2019s unlikely to push the raw material basket for the full year above say 2% inflation. So our outlook of flat to low single-digit is still solid.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","Okay. And then just one more still cut on cost run, I mean you guys were kind of moving I guess outside of North America, you\u2019ve been moving some of your facilities over to sulfate in some markets. Can you give us update kind of where you are in that effort? Thank you.","Chris Connor","Yes Trey, I think we had commented that certainly as new products and technologies are being worked on and we\u2019re exploring all the different types of titanium packages that might help us get to the market. We have seen some switching outside the U.S. Those activities are continuing to move. I don\u2019t think those are going to be dramatic shifts for us, but it\u2019s helping a little bit around the margins.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","All right, thanks a lot. Good luck guys.","Chris Connor","Thank you, Trey.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with Keybanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First on the Comex North America, so it sounds like things are proceeding fairly quickly. So if you look at 2015 and with getting the point sales in all your product constraint involved, would you expect those stores to be up closer to the company average or it would be a slower ramp up than that once all the restructuring is done?","Chris Connor","Right. What we have said is that next year when we will take a look at 2015 we believe that the operating margin will be in the high single-digits. So when you look at the sales next year, it\u2019s going very well, right sizing the SG&A and so forth the gross margins are moving in the right direction. So, we still feel pretty good about that forecast.","Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Great. And then could you just give, you usually do the gross profit and SG&A dollar change for the segment?","Chris Connor","I have the gross profit here, Paint Stores Group, $104.7 million the gross profit increase, consumer was $1.4 million increase, Global Finishes were $5.6 million increase and Latin America was actually a reduction of $6.9 million. On the SG&A, I don\u2019t have those right now.","Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets","I could back it in (inaudible) appreciate it. Thank you.","Chris Connor","Thanks Ivan.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Good morning. And thanks for taking my question.","Chris Connor","Good morning Nils.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Now that you have Comex in the business for about two quarters or so, are you noticing anything different about the pricing strategies between the five different brands that you can optimize? And how are you, how do you feel about getting them fully integrated into the legacy Sherwin strategy?","Chris Connor","Yes Nils, not so much differences between the five brands, but clearly a difference between the way that their organization approached us in a way that the Sherwin\u2019s core business. We referenced the ramp up to our POS system effective March 1 for these stores and that\u2019s really the start of the process, it starts with good data collection. So we can actually look at trends and look at specific customer segmentation, volume sets et cetera. So all that tooling will be helpful for our field teams in coaching our new members of the team here and how to appropriately price these products. And so I think one of the previous callers asked about price increases here as well too.","And these are all the things that will be improving. Sean just gave guidance that we expect next year that these stores will be in the high single-digits in terms of operating margins as a percent of sales. And we\u2019re ramping them up fully to the mid-teens that stores runs at, this will be part of that mix getting that pricing levered properly and implement it. So, work to be done here still.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Understood, understood. I know that you probably don't want to think about Mexico too much anymore, but I'm curious to this whole process, if maybe you've learned something about how you might change your approach to the customer in that country now?","Chris Connor","Yes. We are happy to continue to think about Mexico, we have a good business down there and we were excited for a long time to have a better stance there, obviously it didn't work out that way. I think that remains to be seen and that's probably broader for future conversations to talk a little bit about what our strategy is. Right now we're just trying to [execrate] ourselves from this particular situation we're in.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Got it. Thanks very much.","Chris Connor","Thanks Nils.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Yes, good morning. What was the magnitude of the elevated distribution cost that you had in consumer please?","Chris Connor","So just to give you, while Sean is taking the few numbers up here Kevin, think about the fact that fundamentally [butane] is made from water and when half of the United States is under the pour of vortex we were shifting a lot of pain around this country and zero degree temperatures, below zero temperatures. And so resting heated trailers, having to put some frozen loads in the heated warehouses to get them ready, checking the R&D and some of these things to make sure they are still viable so those are some of the factors that led to these costs.","Sean Hennessy","","Okay. And if you look at these costs, if we backed those costs out consumer margin in the first quarter would have been flat to up slightly year-over-year so we did report 15.7 and so when you look at that you can do the math but that\u2019s where we are at, that\u2019s where the costs us.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Okay, that helps. And then second in the Latin American segment what was the magnitude of the volume decline and the foreign exchange pressure, any addition insights there that would be helpful.","Sean Hennessy","","Again as we mentioned currency actually was effective fell by 16% so we reported a negative 10, with a positive 6 has really driven this, Chris said by the Brazilian real last year was around 2 to 1 this quarter remaining at 2.38 to 2.40 to 1, but when you look at the volume we were negative in the volume for the Latin America group and we really don\u2019t share volumes by segment specially in Latin America.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Okay. And then maybe for Chris apologies if I missed it, but I want to ask you about M&A broadly and what you are seeing on the landscape specifically whether or not you are seeing anything that might still at least partially the void from termination of Comex Mexico if you look at a year or so let\u2019s say?","Chris Connor","Hey Kevin we\u2019ve been clear with the street about our interest and intentions to continue to build out our architectural coatings platform throughout the Western Hemisphere. There are number of terrific companies in all those geographies including Canada, United States throughout all of the Latin American region and time will tell whether any of those come to fruition on that. So this is just, this was one opportunity; we have other ideas that we\u2019ll be working out if time\u2019s with us. Likewise we continue to be focused on building out our industrial coatings platform globally and there are some interesting technologies there as well too. So nothing more to report on that.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Okay. Thanks very much.","Chris Connor","Thanks Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Thank you. Chris question on where do you think we are in the coatings cycle? If I look at your numbers let\u2019s say 4% growth in the overall market last year for U.S. architectural, you get another 4% this year you\u2019re knocking on the door of 700 million gallons. I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about 700, 750 million gallon market is being normalized. So I just wondered if you rethought that.","Chris Connor","Those numbers are pretty accurate Don. I think we\u2019ve been showing that chart now as part of our industrial deck for a couple of years. You will recall that the peak of that market was 800 million gallon and there are some folks commenting that they think that that\u2019s the more realistic number that the market can get to in coming years. As you know we tend to be little more conservative on that.","So I think you are pretty much on target. We\u2019re moving up comfortably now into the mid 600 million gallons for the industry, this will be another year of progress. So pushing in that 700 with another call it 50 to 100 million gallons of our incremental growth for the industry you have to go.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Okay. And then Sean, a housing keeping question, what share repurchase is baked into your guidance and what was the carry out number of shares at the end of the first quarter?","Sean Hennessy","","At the end of the actual share count on May 31, 2014 was 99,651,879 that prefer not to give you, you can imagine each and every quarter we\u2019ve purchased stock, so it\u2019s very likely we\u2019re going to be buying stock over the next three quarters and I will tell you that but I will prefer not to give you the guidance on what our share count is for the year-end.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Okay. Thank you.","Chris Connor","Thanks Don.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Just first question, Chris I think you noted as you expect when weather got better you saw you gave sales improve in the regions that were affected. Any chance you could give us a sense of how they 8% same store sales trended through the quarter?","Chris Connor","Dennis. March was the best quarter, or best month we had in the quarter or January, February about even.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. And then kind of on the same lines, I think you mentioned southwest being the best region east being the worst, how much variation is there between those two?","Bob Wells","Dennis this is Bob. The two strongest divisions were in the double-digit, the other two were in the single.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. And then last one, Chris I think on the global Latin American business, when we look at ex-acquisitions, ex-currency, the growth rate was the best of we have seen I think in about four, five quarters. But the commentary and I think some of the commentary maybe this is the difference volume and price was more negative and just wondering if that\u2019s a trend that's accelerating would you give any concern or is there something maybe that we're missing at high level deal.","Chris Connor","Yes, so are you just speaking about our Global segment Dennis?","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Yes, I was actually looking at both together kind of that concept of Global and Latin America.","Chris Connor","Yes. So I think the we would agree with the Global business, what we're feeling that we're on a good trend line here, we have solidified a lot of the operations in Europe, particularly in the back of our acquisitions there several years ago. Asia is showing some nice improvement from really, really low market share. So, we've got a lot of room to go there, but we're pleased with the process improvement we've seen there, you recall this as a segment that was running at around 3% ROS and now we're pushing up close to targets we told that we can get it to which would be into the low double digit. So, that's tracking well.","And we think if that can't continue to add some tailwind to the company's numbers going forward. Latin America not so much and I think we commented that we expect that we're going to be in for tough (inaudible) here for the rest of the year given the currency and the market environment.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you guys.","Chris Connor","Thanks Dennis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Good morning guys.","Chris Connor","","Good morning Dmitry.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Just, I wanted to -- a lot of my questions have been answered, but wanted to follow up on a couple of things. First of all, in terms of integrating that the Comex operation you talked about closing the four plants in the one headquarters building. Are you pretty much done with the asset footprint rationalization or is there still more to go?","Chris Connor","There is a few more to go.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay. So are you going to be retaining any of the plants that you bought or is there enough room in your plants to relocate the production there and just streamline the operations to that extent?","Chris Connor","Yes, we haven\u2019t specifically commented on that. I think as time unfolds, we will be in a better position to share that with you.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay, alright. In terms of Latin America and the significant margin deterioration you have seen there and profits dollar decline, obviously a lot of it has to do with foreign exchange, what are your expectations for sort of the margin recovery trajectory of that business, is that going to be in 2014 or is it all related to [Finch] coming back?","Chris Connor","","Yes I think that before we give you any type of guidance for the full year, we would like to see another quarter. I mean we just have gone through one quarter. At the beginning of the year, our expectations were if you remember, we had a one-time hit in our mine which was the Brazilian [fund that] situation. But without that, our margins were still -- our operating margins were still strong. At the beginning of the year we thought that we were going to have improvement or at least be flat, I would say, we would like to have seen other quarter but we are not as optimistic about having improved margins as we were three months ago that\u2019s for sure.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay. To follow up on that question, in the past in other businesses and other regions, we have seen companies respond very aggressively with price increases in situations where devaluations of currency was to the extent that we have seen in Latin America, are you sort of moving along that thought path or are you just concerned to sort of wait around and see if the real and the other Latin American currencies will come back?","Sean Hennessy","","Dmitry, if I just go back to the total, our sales were down 10% after currency, and currency was 16%. So, we were up 6% in local currencies. And if you think about, we\u2019ve really have told you that our volume was down, so prices 6, up at least 6 plus but our volume is down. So we\u2019ve been moving prices as aggressively as we can. Some of the governments in South America have started to put pricing limits on, so we have to get approval from the governments. And we\u2019re being as aggressive as we can to get pricing in South America.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Got it. Sean, thank you. And then last question, in terms of your share buybacks, I mean I know you don\u2019t want to give a number for share count at the end of the year but just in terms of sort of releasing the cash that you\u2019ve been holding for Comex deal now and looking to redeploy toward share buybacks, are there any thought being given to sort of accelerated share buybacks or are you still going to be opportunistic and kind of [keel] throughout the quarter or throughout the year?","Sean Hennessy","We really did -- we\u2019ve really done a lot of accelerated stock repurchases 10 years ago, 8 years ago. About 4 years ago the volatility of our stock as well as a lot of other company stock really improved that ASRs really didn\u2019t that were not in your best interest. I would tell you that the volatility in our stock is tremendously lower. I think that we\u2019re interested in getting the stock, the greatest effect at our share count. So yes, we\u2019re evaluating the ASRs at this time. And I think that we want to be in a situation where we can do -- if we do an ASR, we want to be opportunistic of our stock, to become more volatile again.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Got it. Thank you.","Chris Connor","Thanks Dmitry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","Good morning everyone.","Chris Connor","Good morning Jay.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","I wanted to ask first and I apologize if you already answered this. Did you give any timing for the Comex bridge of contract suite and if there is going to be any cost impact?","Chris Connor","","We did comment that we have no idea, what the timing on that will likely be and we made no comment about the cost impact.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","","Okay. Second question if you look at the promotions for the Paint Store Group, public promotions, have those increased versus what you were doing last year and did that have any impact on margins on a year-over-year basis?","Chris Connor","","No, our promotional schedule for our Paint Store\u2019s team has been pretty consistent now for a number of years. They do have these big super sale events around important weekends in the paint season as they start to ramp up, but from a day-to-day comparison year-to-year as well as the discount comparison from year-to-year, Jay, those have been very consistent.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","Okay. Last question on Latin America, I know a lot of people talked about it, but if we think over the next year to two years, given what especially in Brazil where it seems like things are not getting better anytime soon, does this give you an opportunity to be a buyer down there, if conditions do worsen or is the better opportunity maybe to pull back just if you could give us one to two your outlook for that market for [sure one]?","Chris Connor","Yes. So our thoughts on M&A obviously are always long term and we think the long term demand for the kinds of products that we would like to be purchasing and adding to our platform are strong. So where appropriate targets to emerge in Brazil or anywhere throughout Latin American region that we thought we could acquire and improve and enhance their contribution to our earnings growth, we would be interested in doing that. So just too speculative to comment any further on that at this point.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","","Okay. Thank you.","Chris Connor","","Thanks Jay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Matt McGinley with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.","Matt McGinley - ISI Group","Good morning. My first question is a follow-on with some of the comments you made about the Global segment and the margins. And you\u2019ve had tremendous operating efficiency in that segment in this first quarter here. You had very strong margin growth, but pretty weak unit growth. My question is, was there something unique about the first quarter that enabled you to get such strong operating margin expansion, it wouldn\u2019t be relatable to the rest of 2014?","Sean Hennessy","First of all, the Global Finishes Group really recorded solid sales growth in North America, Europe and Asia. And when you look at the scale we have in North America, gallons gone through our footprints, our imprints in North America, gives us a greatest flow through. So that was nice. But they also, when you look at their Latin America, it was a significant drag in the quarter and they also were affected by that currency. So, gallons going through our North America footprint are more efficient.","Matt McGinley - ISI Group","Okay. Thanks for that. And then my second question is on the -- a follow-up on comments you made on Paint Stores Group. In prepared remarks, you said that you realized price, but the mixed impact was so negative. Can you help me understand like what happened with that mix that caused the price increases you have to have a muted impact on your total top-line for that Paint Stores Group?","Sean Hennessy","I just don\u2019t remember us making that comment. I will not say that comment is accurate.","Matt McGinley - ISI Group","Okay. So, pricing was positive in the quarter?","Sean Hennessy","Yes.","Matt McGinley - ISI Group","Okay. And there was not a negative mix impact?","Sean Hennessy","No.","Chris Connor","No, there was not.","Matt McGinley - ISI Group","Alright. I guess I need to get my ears checked before you two.","Chris Connor","I think we said the effective pricing was modest on sales.","Matt McGinley - ISI Group","Okay. That makes sense. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Chris Connor","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","Thanks. Two things; first of all in the Comex business I\u2019m wondering if you could characterize the market share performance you\u2019re seeing of their business kind of before and after? And how that is progressing and where you expect that to go?","Chris Connor","","Yes. So Eric, I think it\u2019s typical with these types of controlled store acquisitions. We commented that this was a struggling asset for the parent company. Their sales have been declining when we acquired them. They have improved slightly from that position, but they are still a little bit negative. So, with the market that\u2019s rebounding in gallon growth, you have to assume that there is some concern if they are losing share.","Interestingly, now with these POSs in place, we can kind of track who those specific customers are. And so a lot of that share transfer has been going from their store locations to ours. And that will be important part of this process for us going forward. I can say with great confidence that in all the markets that we have acquired these stores, the company is not losing share, just maybe seeing a little bit of erosion in the acquired store format.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","","As you look forward, do you think this is sustained throughout the year or can you see a path or investments that you are making that should allow their growth to be similar to the market at some point in 2014?","Chris Connor","","We\u2019ve already seen in a relatively short period of time that trend line moving positively in a very quick fashion. It comes from better inventory in the stores and enhanced and improved associated product line ups that we have been rolling into their store locations as well including some of our own brands for the applicators case and point. So our expectations are that these stores are going to go positive as the year unfolds.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","","And then secondly, I appreciate that a component of the incremental SG&A investment has been the timing of the new store investments, but away from that I\u2019m interested in how you\u2019re thinking about the incremental SG&A that you are investing in the business this year to allow you to participate in the improved market growth or gain market share. Can you just talk a little bit about where are you spending money away from new stores and where we are in the continuum of that incremental SG&A spend?","Sean Hennessy","Yes. A couple of years ago I remember mentioning to you Eric, actually you asked the question, one of the other big issues that we\u2019re spending is some IT projects. And as we continue to roll out our global Oracle platform, early next year we\u2019ll have all of South America, Asia, as well as the United States. And so once we hit there, I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape with IT. But those investments are actually helping us with our working capital. And you can see the results in our working capital.","Usually the first quarter is one of the highest working capital as a percent of sales quarters we have and we\u2019re at [10.4], without the Comex 11 and last year were at 11, 7. So some of these investments are not just for market share, but the majority of them are because of new stores and so forth, reps and so forth. But I would say IT is probably the other one that is really driving some of this cost. A lot of those costs are pretty flat across the year. And so our first quarter being the lowest sales quarter, those costs provided by the lowest sales quarter has the greatest impact on the SG&A as a percent of sales.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","Great. Thank you.","Chris Connor","Thanks Eric.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","Thanks for squeezing me in. Because of the timing of price increases in the stores division, should prices rise sequentially in the second quarter as you more fully implement whatever you raised in the first quarter?","Sean Hennessy","Yes, yes they will Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","","Okay. And secondly, were your volumes flat to up in the consumer division?","Sean Hennessy","Volume wise they were up slightly.","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","","Were up slightly. And then lastly your sales forecast for the second quarter is 8% to 14%. Why so wide?","Sean Hennessy","","I think it really comes down to Latin America Group and the currency and trying to figure out exactly what that currency is going to happen and that\u2019s probably the biggest determination of the wide range.","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","Okay. Great thanks very much.","Chris Connor","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jaideep Pandya with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.","Jaideep Pandya - Berenberg","Yes, thank you and congrats on the great results today. I have two questions; first one is on your gross margin and may be focused on the Paint Stores really. I know you don\u2019t disclose this, but if you look at the previous peak and compare it to in the next couple of years that we\u2019ve had towards the 800 million gallons mark, can you tell us what has really changed, i.e. have you actually structurally improved in gross margin considering also the fact that maybe some of the input cost should be relatively in your favor with all the capacity that is coming into U.S. and if you gained share, if you have improved your price per gallon, would be very curious to know that?","And then the second question I have is on your industrial coatings franchise. What are you really structurally doing to improve this in terms of market share? Are you targeting organic growth levers or are you also looking at some acquisitions to strengthen your franchise in marine protective et cetera? Thank you.","Sean Hennessy","And again, this is Sean Hennessy. And I'll take the first question about the gross margin and structurally where are we. I think that overtime, we use to talk about a range of 41 to 44, we talk about 43 to 46, we're near the peak again. And in fact, we are saying that for the year, we're going to be at 45 to 46.","Overtime, we believe that range will grow for a lot of the things that you just mentioned. We think that we continue to come out with new products that are higher gross margin and then efficiencies. So, I think that our Consumer Group overtime has done a great job of lowering our conversion costs, lowering our warehouse costs, lowering our logistics costs.","So, those two things when you look over a five year period, I mean you look at the amount that new products have continued to help our gross margin. We think that's going to continue and that's why we continue to try to develop new products.","And structurally, we took advantage when the market did crash, when the 800 approximate million gallons a year down to about 575. We did close some plans and some warehouses that are least efficient. So as that market comes back, and we are seeing it that we're actually producing those products in lower cost plants.","Chris Connor","And to the second part of your question Jaideep the industrial coatings franchise really is benefiting now from organic growth. There was a substantial M&A activity probably up to three years ago; trading the platform we needed in various geographies around the world. But as we have seen the significant profit leverage and the sales revenue, market share growth is coming now from the businesses we have. We have commented a couple of times during the call about continuing to be on the hunt for appropriate acquisitions in this space, but for the last couple of years has been mostly organic performance.","Jaideep Pandya - Berenberg","Thank you.","Chris Connor","Thanks Jaideep.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates. Please proceed with your questions.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Thank you, gentlemen, good afternoon, at least good afternoon here. Is the acquisition contribution, is that 100% from Comex or is there something else in there?","Chris Connor","","It\u2019s 100% Comex. We have annualized all of their acquisitions.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Okay. The reason I asked, so some of it is showing up in the Consumer Group business till then?","Chris Connor","","Yes consumer did pickup a piece of that business both most notably dug back and some dealers in Canada and in the United States so they also picked up a piece of that Comex acquisition.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","The reason I ask is the 4.5% is about $97 million of sales if I did my math which I think would have been at the low-end of your forecast. So I guess I am confused. You said it was doing better than you had to what top-line and I guess I am a little confused with the numbers?","Sean Hennessy","","Yes, we gave a sales range in the first quarter and if you look at the midpoint I think I answered it because I assume that he was speaking of the midpoint not the high-end of the range.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Okay, fine. Thanks a lot guys.","Chris Connor","","Thanks Richard.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts - UBS","","Good afternoon. Could you comment on the sales trends and some of the leading indicator things like spray guns, ladders, less consumable oriented items?","Chris Connor","Yes. We\u2019ve got a good quarter John in those categories as well (inaudible) obviously for us is always one of the leading indicators of [gaining] contractor confidence and just as we\u2019ve been talking about strong sales performance in the stores, these categories have been up double-digits as well. So, just adding to the comment that Bob added about since the thing that these anecdotal information we get from seeing these folks in our stores every day.","John Roberts - UBS","Would that tend to your drag on your margin? So back to the next question you had earlier. I would have thought consumables like paint would have been more weather impacted and maybe some of the more leading indicator things people would buy anyway in anticipation when the weather would break so that would actually be a negative mixed effect to have the ladders and [stray] equipment and so forth to outperform paint.","Chris Connor","No, most of those sales start to come in around this time of the year, March and April. This is when we typically see what we call pro-day or pro-show events happening from both children, as well as all the other people in this place. We commented that March was a strong month for us in terms of rebounding in the quarter, so there was not substantial mixed shift away from paint and towards these types of products.","John Roberts - UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Chris Connor","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Jaycee. As a reminder to everyone that\u2019s still on the call, our annual financial community presentation is scheduled for Thursday, May 22 which is going to be held at the Intercontinental Barclays Hotel in New York City.

After the Company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions.","I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Jessie. Good morning, everyone. We\u2019ve provided a supplemental slide deck with a breakdown of our results by reportable segment on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations July 24th press release.","Consolidated sales in the second quarter 2018 increased $1.04 billion or 27.8%, to $4.77 billion. Compared to pro forma combined results from second quarter 2017, consolidated sales for the quarter increased 7.5%. Consolidated gross profit dollars in the second quarter increased $304 million or 17.5% to $2.04 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the second quarter was 42.7% compared to 46.4% in the same period last year.","Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $154.1 million or 13.4% to $1.31 billion in the second quarter, but decreased as a percent of sales to 27.4% from 30.9% last year. The decreases in both gross margin and SG&A as a percent of sales is primarily the result of a mix effect from the inclusion of Valspar.","As a reminder, second quarter 2017 included only one month of Valspar results. Interest expense for the quarter increased $36.8 million to $93.5 million. The increase was entirely due to the acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before tax in the second quarter increased $29.1 million or 5.7% to $538.1 million. Our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 25%. We expect our core effective tax rate for the full year 2018 to be in the low-20s.","Second quarter diluted net income per common share increased 26.5% to $4.25 per share from $3.36 in the same period last year. The $4.25 includes $1.23 per share in acquisition-related expenses, including purchase accounting and amortization, and a $0.25 per share charge from environmental expense provisions. Valspar operations contributed income of $0.91 per share in the quarter net of incremental interest expense. We\u2019ve summarized the second quarter earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our second quarter 2018 press release.","Let me take a few moments to break down our performance by segment. Sales for The Americas Group in the second quarter increased $187.4 million or 7.7% to $2.63 billion. Comparable store sales in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean increased 6.8% in the quarter. Regionally, in the second quarter, our Canada Division led all divisions, followed by Southwest Division, Southeast Division, Eastern Division and Mid Western Division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division.","Currency translation reduced net sales in U.S. dollars by 50 basis points in the quarter. Second quarter segment profit increased $37.2 million or 7% to $569.9 million. Second quarter segment operating margin increased 20 basis points to 21.7% from 21.5% last year, but we realized an $8 million unfavorable swing in other income for The Americas Group compared to second quarter last year.","Turning now to Consumer Brands Group. Second quarter external net sales increased $241.3 million or 45% to $777.7 million. Incremental Valspar sales from April and May 2018 increased group net sales 42.7% in the quarter. Revenue reclassification related to the newly adopted ASC 606 reduced net sales by 5.1%.","Segment profit for the Consumer Brands Group in the second quarter increased $14.8 million or 19.5% to $90.9 million. Segment profit for the quarter includes a $28.5 million charge for purchase accounting-related items. Segment profit as a percent of sales for the quarter decreased to 11.7% from 14.2% last year.","For our Performance Coatings Group, second quarter net sales increased $608.2 million or 79.9% to $1.37 billion. Incremental Valspar sales from April and May 2018, increased group net sales 72.9% in the quarter. Currency translation rate changes increased segment sales $5.1 million or 67 basis points in the quarter.","Segment profit for the Performance Coatings Group in the second quarter increased $81.8 million or 131.3% to $144.2 million. Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit $2.5 million in the quarter. Segment profit for the quarter includes a $47.6 million charge for purchase accounting-related items. And segment profit margin increased to 10.5% from 8.2% last year.","I\u2019ll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our Lead Pigment Litigation. In our Santa Clara County, California lawsuit, we expect the trial court judge to issue a preliminary decision in August regarding the amount of the abatement funds. This preliminary decision will be in advance of a hearing on this topic currently scheduled for August 17.","We have the right to appeal if we disagree with the judge\u2019s ruling on the abatement fund amount. In addition, on July 16, we filed a petition for cert with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking discretionary review. We expect to hear whether the Supreme Court accepts the case during the fourth quarter of 2018. In the interim, we have filed a motion to stay the Santa Clara County, California proceeding while the Supreme Court petition is pending. We continue to believe that the judgment of the California court conflicts with established principals of law and is unsupported by the evidence.","That concludes our review of our operating results for the second quarter. So, let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will \u2013 to make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the remainder of 2018. John?","John Morikis","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I\u2019ll offer my comments on our second quarter results in just a few minutes. but I\u2019d like to begin by focusing on our outlook for the full year. As you read in our press release this morning, we\u2019re raising our full-year outlook for diluted net income per common share. This increase in our guidance is based on several factors that give us confidence in the second half of the year and beyond.","First, our teams delivered a solid performance in the first half, and we exited the quarter with strong sales momentum, which is usually a reliable leading indicator. Second, the positive demand trends we see are broad-based across most businesses and geographies, which should support our growth expectations over the balance of the year. Third, we have great confidence in the ability of our operating teams to execute on growth initiatives, manage expenses and implement sufficient pricing to offset lingering raw material inflation.","And finally, we feel good about our progress on the integration plans and synergy targets we laid out at the beginning of the year. As for our specific guidance, we expect third quarter consolidated sales to increase at a mid-to high single-digit percentage rate compared to the third quarter of 2017.","Keep in mind; June 1st marked the one-year anniversary of the Valspar acquisition, which makes third quarter 2018 the first quarter in which our results will be fully comparable to last year. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect core net sales to increase mid-to high single-digit percentage compared to full-year 2017. In addition, the incremental sales from Valspar in the first five months of 2018 added approximately $1.85 billion to consolidated revenues.","As we\u2019ve described on previous calls, the many moving parts in last year\u2019s results and this year\u2019s guidance can make it challenging to understand our underlying earnings per share performance. We believe the most meaningful way to view guidance is to back out the Valspar acquisition-related costs and other one-time items. On this basis, we are updating our expectation for our full-year 2018 adjusted diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $19.05 to $19.35 per share, a 27% increase at the midpoint compared to the $15.07 we reported last year on a comparable basis.","This adjusted EPS range excludes $3.80 to $3.90 per share in transaction, integration and purchase accounting expenses, and the $0.25 per share charge we took in the second quarter for environmental provisions.","Compared to the full year earnings guidance we provided three months ago, this revised range reflects our confidence that we will more than offset the earnings dilution from the rollout of the Lowe\u2019s partnership we discussed on our first quarter call. We\u2019ve included a Regulation G reconciliation table with this morning\u2019s press release to better illustrate all the moving parts.","Our adjusted results in the second quarter were records for any quarter in our history in terms of net sales, gross profit and profit before taxes. Underlying demand remained solid across most of our end markets, and the Valspar business continued to add to our momentum.","At the same time, year-over-year raw material inflation was slightly higher than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. This was primarily the result of higher-than-expected propylene pricing in May and June, which affected the cost of many petrochemical components in our raw material basket and resulted in a LIFO charge in the quarter. The LIFO charge, combined with a modest increase in raw material costs versus plan, pressured operating margins in all three reportable segments.","At this point, it\u2019s unclear whether these factors will significantly alter our full year outlook for average raw material inflation. What is clear is that we will continue to work to offset these escalating costs by controlling spending and implementing price increases where necessary. Given that we now passed the one-year anniversary of Valspar, this will be the last quarter that we break out core Sherwin-Williams results versus Valspar results.","Today, we are operating as a single integrated company. And from an accounting perspective, the divisions between the legacy businesses are becoming more blurred and less instructive. At this point, measuring operating profit across the legacy Sherwin-Williams and Valspar businesses is both difficult and somewhat arbitrary.","All three of our reportable segments made progress in the second quarter in driving revenue growth and profit improvement. The Americas Group continued to focus on growing share of wallet among existing customers, opening new accounts and driving higher trial across our premium product lines and our e-commerce platform.","Same-store sales in the quarter were fairly robust despite continuing market constraints in some regions, which slightly pushed some projects into the back half of the year. Sales to residential repaint contractors in the U.S. and Canada grew at a double-digit pace for the 17th time in the last 19 quarters.","Protective & Marine coatings in the U.S. and Canada also grew by double digits. And property management, new residential, commercial, DIY and health care segments all contributed to TAG\u2019s growth in the quarter. Latin America sales increased 4.4%. It appears that the fundamental demand trends remains strong across the business.","The group opened 18 net new stores in the quarter, bringing our total store count to 4,642 at the end of the quarter. Our full-year plan calls for this team to add between 90 to 100 net new stores in The Americas by year-end.","TAG segment operating margin increased 20 basis points compared to the second quarter last year, despite the impact of slightly higher-than-expected raw material costs and the LIFO expense taken in the quarter. Operating margin on incremental sales in the quarter was in the mid-20% range. Our Latin America business operating margin was negative low single digits, which was a which was a drag on segment profit in the quarter.","Gross margin for this segment was down modestly compared to 2017, but SG&A improved as a percent of sales compared to last year. Bob provided results for the Consumer Brand and Performance Coatings Groups compared to last year\u2019s second quarter as reported.","I\u2019d like to look at our results for this quarter compared to pro forma combined results from second quarter 2017 to give you a clearer picture of the underlying performance of these segments. Consumer Brands Group sales increased 1.5% on a year-over-year basis compared to pro forma sales from second quarter last year.","As Bob mentioned, the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard reduced revenues by a little over 5% in the second quarter this year. So it\u2019s a pretty solid sales quarter on a comparable basis. From a margin perspective, if you back out the impact of purchase accounting items in both years, adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 15.4% this year versus 16.2% on a comparable basis a year ago.","The year-over-year decrease in adjusted operating margin was primarily a result of increased costs associated with the inventory build and load-in to support the expanded Lowe\u2019s partnership, higher year-over-year raw material costs and a LIFO charge. The Lowe\u2019s program is proceeding as planned and gaining momentum. Selected product category resets have been completed nationally, with the remainder expected to be completed this summer. We remain confident in achieving our shared goal of accelerating top growth in the Lowe\u2019s paint aisle.","Performance Coatings Group revenues increased 11% compared to pro forma combined sales in the second quarter of 2017. Sales were up in every product category, most by double digits, led by packaging coatings, general industrial, coil and Industrial Wood Coatings.","If you add back the purchase accounting items, adjusted operating margin in the quarter was flat to last year at 40% on a comparable basis and well above the 12.1% recorded last quarter. This sequential improvement in operating margin is a function of sales volume leverage, successful pricing initiatives, spending control and integration progress, all of which more than offset higher year-over-year raw material costs and a LIFO charge taken in the quarter.","EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increased, 29% to $1.33 billion in the first six months, compared to the same period last year. EBITDA margin for the first six months was 15.2% versus 15.8% in the same period a year ago. Six-month adjusted EBITDA, which excludes one-time transaction and integration expenses, was $1.40 billion or 16% of sales.","Net operating cash year-to-date was $579 million compared to $586 million a year ago. As a reminder, net operating cash in the first six months last year included a benefit of approximately $88 million from settlement of a treasury lock hedge. On June 30, the company had $135 million of cash on hand that will be utilized to reduce debt and fund operations.","During the quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.86 per share, paying $81 million in cash dividends. The balance sheet reflects total debt of approximately $10.4 billion. We intend to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to approximately 3:1 by the end of 2018. We remain committed to reducing debt by $1 billion by the end of this year.","Our capital expenditures year-to-date totaled $101.8 million. Depreciation was $144.1 million, and amortization of intangibles was $158.9 million. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $330 million, which is about 1.9% of anticipated sales. As we continue to invest in productivity improvements, systems and new stores, depreciation should be between $280 million to $290 million, and amortization will be about $325 million, including purchase accounting depreciation of $44 million and amortization of $300 million.","We continued opportunistic open-market purchases of company stock in 2018 at a level sufficient to offset dilution from option exercises. In the first six months, we purchased 850,000 shares at an average price of $393.12 per share. On June 30, we had remaining authorization to acquire approximately 10.8 million shares.","Finally, we continue to make good progress towards integrating Sherwin-Williams and Valspar into one streamlined, high-performance company. And I believe this progress is beginning to show in our results. Much of the heavy lifting involved in creating a fully integrated North American supply chain is behind us, and a wide range of opportunities to improve our productivity and operating efficiency outside of the Americas has been identified and are in process.","We are on track to achieve our 2018 synergy targets and had booked a little more than half of the anticipated annual benefit to our P&L in the first half. Most importantly, our associates across all disciplines, sales and marketing, technical and operations, are embracing the vision and promise of this new organization.","I\u2019d like to close by thanking all of our employees, who have worked so hard since we completed the Valspar acquisition on June 1st of last year. I\u2019m extremely proud of the progress we\u2019ve made, and my enthusiasm for the prospects of our combined organization has only increased over the past year. I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll continue to deliver superior value to our customers and reward our shareholders over the long-term.","With that, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John Morikis","Good morning, Arun.","Arun Viswanathan","Yeah. Thanks John. So yeah, just a question on the raw material outlook. So I guess, just trying to understand what\u2019s embedded in your guidance raise of about $0.55 at the midpoint. Does that assume raw materials are stable from here or declining modestly or increase a little bit as well?","John Morikis","Yeah. This is Bob. As we indicated in our prepared remarks, the raw material inflation for the industry in second quarter was slightly above our expectation, and that puts it just above the high end of our 5% to 6% inflation range for the full year. We originally said we expected raw material inflation to peak in the second quarter and moderate in the back half. And based on the recent move in propylene and some of the crude oil derivatives, we now believe that year-over-year raw material inflation will be higher than we originally expected in the third quarter. And we expect to see pricing stabilizing in the fourth quarter probably as opposed to declining meaningfully. So, our raw material outlook has changed somewhat, and that\u2019s embedded in the full-year guidance.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks, Bob. And then, Bob, on the tax rate, you\u2019re now guiding to low-20s. I mean, when we look at that, you\u2019ve previously guided at 20% to 25%. So is that, you\u2019re basically saying that you expect 1% to 2% average lower tax rate for the year? And I mean, if so, does that equate to about $0.20 to $0.30 of EPS? Maybe, you can just talk about that.","John Morikis","Yeah, Arun. I do believe we\u2019re going to be in that low-20% mark. I think the \u2013 based on lower first quarter and where the year estimate was, I think that equates \u2013 I think it\u2019s closer to your $0.20 to $0.25 a share. But we did have goodness in our second quarter. We are consistently looking at lowering our tax rate. One way to do that is by consolidating foreign entities, and we have a large number of foreign entities today with Valspar. It's just hard to predict timing and, sometimes, magnitude of those changes. But we did have a consolidation in our second quarter that lowered the tax rate to that 20.5% core that helped drive that full year tax rate to the low 20s.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks. And just lastly on the comp store sales. You noticed an acceleration for 5.2% to 6.8% in the quarter. Does that break out at, say, 4% volume, 3% price or 2.8% price? So both of those accelerated sequentially? Or was it a slightly different makeup? And then maybe you can just talk about your outlook for the rest of the year on comp stores. Thanks.","John Morikis","Yes. The price\/mix effect, Arun, in the quarter was approximately 2.5%. And I would say our outlook for the comp stores going forward is very strong. We're feeling \u2013 the momentum that we have here is terrific. I mentioned the res repaint business, the Protective & Marine all growing very strong. Every segment's moving in the right direction. So we're feeling quite positive about our stores, and we think that's only going to continue.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks guys.","John Morikis","Thanks, Arun.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hey guys, good morning. Just to the follow-up to the last question on the 6.8% same-store sales growth. Do you think that it was weighed upon in any material way from weather early in the quarter that seems to have tripped up a lot of your peer group as well?","John Morikis","Well, I'd say that what it did do is create some pressure in the sense that, that first quarter was tough. So the construction industry got off to a slow start, not just painting. And so it's pushed some volume, we believe, into the third quarter. The momentum that we have here, we think, is terrific. We think we're growing share. We're growing momentum. We think 6.8% comp is a good number, and we believe we're going to continue to grow.","Al Mistysyn","What I would add to that, Ghansham, this is Al, is that as we even talked about on our first quarter call, we started up with a wet April. So as we progressed through the quarter, sales strength improved, which gives us that confidence going forward in the third quarter and the rest of the year.","John Morikis","Yes, coming out of the quarter, it was \u2013 we're gaining speed coming out of the quarter.","Ghansham Panjabi","Can you share with us exactly what that was coming out of the quarter?","John Morikis","No.","Al Mistysyn","We don't want to get that granular by month, but we did see an improvement as the quarter went on.","Ghansham Panjabi","I had to try. And just my follow-up question on the organic volume growth by segment. Performance in consumer, there's a lot of moving pieces with FX and pricing, et cetera. Can you just kind of break out the volume aspect? Thank you so much.","Al Mistysyn","So in the second quarter, you look at \u2013 really, we had price across all the segments, and we don't comment about each of the segments in price. But you can \u2013 but that it's close in that 2% \u2013 a little over 2% range. FX was fairly mild in the quarter. For the consolidated, it was only up plus 1\/10 [ph] and even within the segments, they're all below 1%. And then, so if you just look at the sales of those segments, the rest has to be volume and mix. And Performance Coatings was very strong, with the double-digit gains on the pro forma. Consumer Group had a nice quarter when you \u2013 if you back out the revenue recognition adjustment that we took, which was almost 5% in the quarter. So I would say volumes are up across the board, and we're getting price. ","Ghansham Panjabi","Thanks so much.","John Morikis","Thanks Ghansham.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed.","Emily Wagner","Good morning. Emily Wagner on for Don. Just going back to raw materials, given your higher outlook for the year, at what point would you expect your year-over-year gross margin to recover as well as segment margin recovery?","Al Mistysyn","Our guidance at the midpoint of 19, 20, we do expect our gross margins to improve sequentially through the rest of the year. When we'll be able to get over the top of that, we're looking at early next year, assuming raw materials moderate some, as Bob talked about, in the back half. So sequential improvement in gross margin through the rest of this year, and we'll be looking to get on top of the year-over-year margin going into next year.","Emily Wagner","Great. And as the follow-up in terms of the volume growth. So it seems like same- store sales, about 4% of it was volume growth. Does that imply that the U.S. market is growing at around 2% for the full year? What's your outlook for underlying U.S. demand growth?","Bob Wells","Emily, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the DIY business has been a lot slower than the contractor side of the business. That's been true certainly in our own stores. We measure DIY sales to our stores. It was the slowest-performing market segment in the quarter. So while, clearly, the contractor business is growing well above that 2% range, it's \u2013 I think it's safe to assume that the market's probably grown between 2% and 3%. Our stores volume was a little ahead of 4%.","Emily Wagner","Great. Thank you.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Mushkin","Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. So I guess, I had two things I wanted to ask you about. Number one is, I mean, obviously, everything is going really well for the company. Even I think Performance Coating had a great quarter. As we look out with the fed raising interest rates, how do you guys think about, as we look beyond this year, just a general part of the business, and the fact that it's probably a little bit more exposed to the industrial economy.","Bob Wells","Good question Scott. And obviously, rising interest rates would potentially have an impact on both the architectural side of the business and the industrial. If you look at the manufacturing sector in June, the PMI increased for the 22nd consecutive month. And the market's expanding in all regions, and production in inventories are growing at a faster pace than they did last year. So it's hard to point to any effect that the fed raising had had on the industrial economy thus far. On the construction and residential side of the economy, we believe the slower residential starts and resales are more indicative of supply constraints than they are weakening demand. So there may be constraints out there in the market, but they don't seem to be interest rate related at this stage.","Scott Mushkin","Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, my second question. I think on the last conference call, you guys talked about maybe jumping back into the M&A market. And I did want to think about that in context of where we are from a macro perspective and maybe just get an update on your thoughts, how much \u2013 are assets getting more expensive? Kind of just give us an update on that, that would be great. And then I'll yield.","John Morikis","It\u2019s hard to generalize on the question of are they getting more \u2013 increasing in value, perceived value of the owners or not. I think that varies. I will say this. We continue to monitor the industry for what we believe to be a good fit for Sherwin-Williams. And most likely, these deals in the shorter term will be smaller bolt-on that will help us expand technology and maybe add or enhance geographic \u2013 our footprint geographically. But we're out there. We're having good discussions. And we're engaged, looking for the right opportunities. We're not just out looking for anything to put us anywhere. We're very disciplined in our approach, and we're excited about some of the discussions we're having.","Scott Mushkin","Hey, perfect guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","John Morikis","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Duffy Fischer","Yes, good morning.","John Morikis","Good morning, Duffy.","Duffy Fischer","Just around the big box business right now. Obviously, with DIY struggling, big shifts in the DIY aisle. Are you guys seeing any difference in behavior, either marketing programs or discounts, from a normal year?","John Morikis","Duffy, if anything, we're seeing a more rational pricing environment than a year ago. So we're feeling pretty good about the environment as it exists.","Duffy Fischer","Okay. Fair enough. And then could you give us some help with the mix shift on the SG&A line? That 27%, is that what we should kind of use to run forward? Or how will that line look over kind of the rest of this year and going into next year?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Duffy, if you \u2013 the way I look at it, the first half \u2013 the second half \u2013 let me say it this way. Our SG&A as a percent of sales should be down in the second half versus the first half.","Duffy Fischer","Terrific. Okay, thank you, guys.","John Morikis","Thanks, Duff.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes, hi, good morning.","John Morikis","Good morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar","A couple of questions on your Lowe's business. First, at Lowe's, you wanted to reduce number of combined SKUs and simplify the offering. Can you talk about that? And then you also mentioned the initial fill and loading at Lowe's. Was there any benefit in the quarter from initial fill?","John Morikis","Let me take the simplified product offering, and I'll ask Al to comment on your second part of your question, P.J. We're not going to give any of the specifics, but I will share with you the overall direction we are taking with Lowe's is to, in fact, simplify the offering. And part of that comes with less suppliers. Another portion of that comes with the recognition that by simplifying the offering, we can make it easier for both sales associates and the consumer to understand. So we feel we have a terrific lineup that's going to be rolling out. And we're really excited about our relationship with Lowe's in the future here, and we think it's going to be an opportunity for us to continue to add shareholder value.","Al Mistysyn","So on the rollout, P.J., the \u2013 we're ahead of schedule with aerosols, interior and exteriors paints set nationally, and paint rolling out as we speak. The adjusted sales, over 6% on the pro forma basis, excluding rev rec, was solid. However, the costs were higher in the quarter for the Lowe's expenses than we had planned. And as the \u2013 including the raw material, higher than we thought, our margin declined. So we're not going to break out how much is related to Lowe's going forward. We just want to be sensitive to our customer, and we also want to be sensitive to \u2013 they're driving the rollout, and we feel good about where we're at there. That all being said, if you look at our year-to-date margins, along with price and good cost control and the volumes we're seeing, our operating margin's up, and I think the team has turned in a solid performance.","P.J. Juvekar","Great. Al, a question for you on LatAm. Sales were up 4.4%, but just in the last few months, currencies have come down significantly. They're down double digits year-over-year. Economy has slowed down, particularly in Brazil. I'm just wondering if you have any comments, given your negative margins in second quarter. Do you see that getting worse before it gets better?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, because as you know, P.J., majority of the raw material costs are dollar-denominated. And as we see the devaluations, our costs go up. Raw materials are a similar percent to sale. Percent of cost of goods sold as in the U.S. So we're going to be chasing price with the significant devaluations we saw in Argentina, Brazil and even a little bit in Mexico. So \u2013 and that is built into our full year guidance.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Bob Koort","Thank you very much. I wanted to ask you in the Performance Coatings area. You guys acknowledged there was some lag in pricing there, but obviously, you've made up some pretty significant margin improvement. Can you talk a little bit about how much that came from synergies, how much came from price? And then what there may be still on the horizon from latent price hikes that are still working their way through?","John Morikis","Bob, we have pricing that has taken effect. We have more pricing that is rolling in. And we're really proud of the team's ability to retain these customers, grow our business while getting the price in. It's a challenging market when you think about what's happening from a raw standpoint. But we think we're really teaming up with the right customers. We have great relationships with customers that are trying to grow their business, and we're finding opportunities for new business as well. So we have good pricing in, more is rolling in, and good momentum. So the team's doing a terrific job.","Al Mistysyn","What I'd comment, Bob, on the raw material synergies is we haven't broke out synergies by segment. But what I would say is we are still on track for the $140 million to $160 million in synergies for the year. We've booked a little bit more than half of those in the quarter, and those are really broken out between \u2013 I'm sorry, in the first half. And those are really broken out primarily Consumer Performance Coatings, and then you get some in corporate.","Bob Koort","Got it. And then one of your bigger buys is TiO2, and it looks like there may be some conclusion and some consolidation in that industry. I'm wondering, how could that affect you at all? And is there any more desire in your part to engage in some of these longer-term fixed price contracts there?","Bob Wells","Yes. The TiO2 market is kind of in flux right now. You've probably read a lot about the supply-demand balance evolving in Europe. We don't think that, that is going to materially affect the market in North America this year. We commented in the past that we are going to negotiate raw materials in a way that will benefit our shareholders if that means locking in longer-term agreements to ensure supply and to achieve stable pricing. And that's a benefit to our shareholders. We would do that. But we're cautious about the timing of these longer-term contracts relative to market pricing when the suppliers are [indiscernible].","John Morikis","Our teams are very well aware of where we are in the cycle and are adjusting accordingly. So we're going in with our eyes wide open, Bob.","Bob Koort","Got it. Thank you.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts","Thank you. In the supplemental slides, since this is the last quarter we're going to get the breakout between Valspar and legacy Sherwin, could you just comment on the consumer performance segment on the different growth rates we see between Valspar and Sherwin contributions there? Is that just the easier comps in the Valspar numbers?","Al Mistysyn","John, I think that we saw 5% growth on the Valspar on a pro forma basis down. But on the core Sherwin, if you back out the impact of the rev rec, we're still up low single digits. And I'd say that's kind of where we expected to be. Yes, we're going against a softer quarter, but I think the team is going well. And as we looked at the different segments, of national accounts other than Lowe's, commercial, Europe, all positive. And like we've talked about in the past, we do have headwinds in that retail segment.","John Morikis","But John, to be clear, the teams aren't as concerned with are we selling Thompson's or Cabots. We're just trying to sell. So the line's quickly blurred when we consolidated those teams together and gave them one sales goal. So we're reporting a number that we're not \u2013 truly, we're not managing the business that way. We're reporting a comp number, but we're focused on growing sales. And we're not concerned with which brand the team sells.","John Roberts","Okay. And as a follow-up, now that we're in the third quarter, when we seasonally go into the fourth quarter later this year, should we expect a similar seasonal sales drop to the second half last year? You had Valspar in both third and fourth quarter last year. But maybe, seasonally, the EBITDA might decline a little bit more sequentially fourth versus third because you're further along in the cost savings, and you had more sequential progress going on last year?","Al Mistysyn","Yes. I think that\u2019s a typical \u2013 I agree with what your first statement John is. That's our typical flow. And I would say, even though with Valspar and the bigger industrial business were less seasonal than we used to be, we still do have a seasonal impact in that third going to fourth quarter.","Bob Wells","And also John to add to that, we are going to achieve more year-over-year synergy benefits in the first half than we're going in the second half.","John Roberts","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you very much guys. Could you just quantify the LIFO charges by segment? And should we be anticipating any further LIFO charges in the third quarter or obviously in the fourth quarter?","Al Mistysyn","Vincent, we\u2019re not going to call out the individual LIFO charge by segment. It's a function of increasing raw materials. And with the raw costs being up more than what we had thought coming into the quarter, we had to true that up in our second quarter. So you estimate what the full year LIFO is, you have to take half of it through your first half, and that's what we did. But I don't want to be quantifying what those are by segment. It's all part of the raw material increase, in my mind.","John Morikis","to that point, Vincent, Al's point about the raw material cost increases, that's what drives our thinking about our price to our customers. And as we've talked on numerous occasions, we stay very close to what's happening with the total basket of raw materials. When we see that basket move, we've historically demonstrated the ability and our effective pricing through our stores and other businesses here to put that pricing in. And no one should question our conviction or our determination to continue to manage those margins. When we see pricing move, we're going to \u2013 we move. And as we have historically approached this, the practice is to communicate the price increase to our customers first and then to the investment community. So we'll be talking to you about our activities likely in the near future.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Just as a follow-up, at Lowe's, now that you're the sole paint supplier, has anything changed about the mechanism by which you can sort of adjust prices versus raws in that line of your business?","John Morikis","Yes. We have a good agreement with Lowe's. We're not going to get into the details of any mechanisms, but suffice it to say, we've got a program that's going to keep us both focused on growing sales and not arguing about price.","Vincent Andrews","Excellent. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","John Morikis","Thanks, Vincent.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","David Begleiter","Thank you. John, on Valspar, looked like you did better than you expected in the quarter. I think you were expecting $600 million worth of sales. You did closer to $800 million. When did that really pick up? And what drove that better-than-expected performance?","John Morikis","Well, you have to look at our Performance Coatings business up 11%. And as we talked about in the prepared comments, nearly every one of those segments up double digits. So this is a wonderful team that we've inherited with great products, great relationships with customers. And combined, we're finding that it's an even stronger value proposition to our customers. So the Performance Coatings business is, as I mentioned before, growing well, and we're implementing the price that we need. So we're feeling really good about that and the future. I mean, there's \u2013 I think there's really a sustainable growth pattern here.","And then on the consumer architectural side, again, a wonderful leadership team with great products and great relationships with customers that we're trying to really leverage to the fullest. So we're really happy. I've often said how thrilled we are with the Valspar acquisition. And I know it sounds a bit repetitive, but I'm happier right now with Valspar than ever. And the future is only stronger for us. So we're feeling this has been a terrific move for us.","David Begleiter","And John, in that business, amongst packaging, GI, coil and wood, had Valspar lost some share that you are now gaining back? Is it helping to drive some of the heightened sales growth here?","John Morikis","No, I don't think so. I think we've been open about that they've not been outlook pricing. But I don't think that they've lost share. In fact, I think we'd be hard-pressed to point to any single customer that we've lost. I mean, we've been very successful in retaining customers and the employees. So it's going very well.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good morning. Given the raw material backdrop as it stands, at least one of your competitors has pointed to opportunities to reformulate. Do you see any opportunity at Sherwin to reformulate in terms of pigment contents, resin systems or other inputs?","John Morikis","Yes, Kevin, we\u2019re formulating for TiO2 efficiency truly has been something that we've been doing for many years. And there are a number of products that are commercially available to help formulators with that. We also have our own proprietary technology that we've developed internally. Our approach to this is very unique. You have to keep in mind that our customers have very, very high expectations for consistency. When you have the mix of business that we have with a professional painter, close isn't close enough for our customers. So we go through an extensive commercialization process. We've got a number of checks and balances. So it's in our repertoire of tools that we use, but we're also very cautious in how we approach this to ensure that it, in most cases, ends up with an increased or improved attribute for our customers.","Kevin McCarthy","Second question, if I may, on capital deployment. I think you articulated some specific goals for leverage. Just wondering if you could comment on repurchase activity in that context. Looks like you \u2013 if my math is correct, you would have purchased 0.25 million shares in the second quarter, down a bit from 1 Q. What sort of pace might we anticipate the back half?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Kevin, you are correct. We did purchase 0.25 million shares, bringing our full year year-to-date total to 850,000 shares at $334 million. I think if you look over the last three years, our option dilution has been approximately one million shares. We're running a little above high net so far year-to-date, but we'll watch that. We'll continue to look at buying shares opportunistically. But we'll look at the options and adjust from there in the second half.","Kevin McCarthy","Thank you so much.","John Morikis","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Harrison","Hi, good morning.","John Morikis","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Harrison","Just looking at the Just looking at the consumer business and the differences in the performance between Valspar and Sherwin, did both pieces have the revenue reclassification? Or was it just Sherwin that had that headwind?","Al Mistysyn","Both had the headwind, and it was split 50-50 roughly.","Mike Harrison","Okay. And then was wondering if, within that consumer business, you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the Valspar China architectural business. How did that do in the quarter? And are you seeing any reason for caution going forward in China?","John Morikis","I would say for both Europe and China, the architectural businesses were positive. And we see continued opportunity for profit improvement in both of those regions. We're staying close. We're learning a lot as we go, and we'll be making appropriate investments as we see the opportunity for disciplined growth.","Mike Harrison","All right. Then last one if I could, is regarding the environmental item this quarter. I feel like in the past, you guys haven't backed those out, but this one seemed a little bigger and maybe more significant. Can you give us some detail on what that entailed?","Al Mistysyn","Sure, Mike. Historically, we have backed out significant adjustments to the environmental provision. This is one \u2013 as you can expect, the timing and magnitude of some of these adjustments are harder to predict. So this one in particular relates to one of the large sites that we've been investigating and remediating on an ongoing basis and quite honestly, there's more to come related to that site. It's just \u2013 again, it's hard to predict timing and amounts. But as soon as we know it, we adjust the provision, and then we call it out.","Mike Harrison","All right. Thanks very much.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Melich","Thanks. I have a follow-up on sort of looking at the back half and the guidance and how SG&A flows through. So if gross margins are going to be under some pressure just given raws, to get there, it looks like SG&A will still be under some pretty good control. You keep it around where it is, maybe growing 2% year-over-year. Does that fit with where your guidance and what you're thinking?","Al Mistysyn","I think, we don\u2019t walk down the P&L in detail. But I think you're going to see leverage on our SG&A. As our volumes continue to grow, you would expect to see our leverage there. We still have more synergies rolling in, in the second half. So yes, you should expect to see a sequential \u2013 like I said, a second half being lower than our first half as a percent.","John Morikis","And Greg, to your point, price rolling in as well.","Greg Melich","And the price that we have right now, price\/mix coming in at like 2.5%, it sounds like that's still rolling in. So that might move up to sort of like 3% and then plateau into the fourth quarter. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, I think we have prices rolling in. It's across the different segments. It doesn't roll in as uniformly as our stores group. So yes, there is still pricing going in.","Greg Melich","Got it. And then I had a follow-up, as far as we haven't gotten there yet. I know it's probably not big for you guys, yet the \u2013 with all the tariff talk around the world and different things, particularly China, is there anything that you're bringing in that's material that we should be aware of in terms of what's sourced overseas that could be subject?","Bob Wells","And specifically, we look at the tariff impact on our raw material basket first and foremost. And frankly, at this point, we don't believe the impact of at least the proposed tariffs at this point will impact our raw material basket substantially. Right now, steel and tin plate is where we're seeing most of the effect, and it's not material to the raw material basket certainly relative to the petrochemical proportion of the basket and TiO2. But as you know, it's an evolving story, and future impacts are not entirely clear. So we're keeping an eye on it.","Greg Melich","Great, thanks guys. Good luck.","John Morikis","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Parkinson","Great, thank you. I understand it's relatively new, but can you give any broader updates on your Americas e-commerce efforts and how you feel this will evolve over time? It seems like you're in the process of building on some sort of foundations to boost pro growth and reduce some costs. But just how should we think about this across your relative customer groups? And what inning would you characterize this in? Thank you.","John Morikis","So, Chris, I\u2019d say we\u2019re in a very, very early innings of what we consider to be a very exciting opportunity. And the opportunity here to build on existing relationships and leverage the distribution points that we have in our store are really exciting. And so when you look at the opportunity to capture additional share of wallet and grow customer \u2013 or grow our customer base through these platforms of distribution, it \u2013 this e-commerce initiative is just a natural, the ability for customers to do business with us 24 hours with the ability to understand their projects. And we've got a lot of features that we're building into this to increase the loyalty of our customers to our brand and to our stores. And we're in the process of developing more and more features. We're rolling out in different areas, different \u2013 testing different areas geographically. And when it all comes together, we're really believing this can help us in quite a dramatic way. So it's an exciting initiative for us.","Christopher Parkinson","And just a quick follow-up. Can you just talk a little bit more about the recent reductions in some regional housing inventories? Just how should we think about this and \u2013 or interpret this on a relative basis versus the home appreciation that we're seeing? Just how \u2013 what do you think about these two various drivers and how it should drive revenues in Americas? And then just any quick comment on residential versus commercial labor constraints would also be appreciated. Thank you.","Bob Wells","Yeah, Chris. This is Bob. Let me handle the inventory effect on resales, and then I'll ask John to talk about commercial labor constraints and the like. I mentioned earlier that the slower residential starts and resales are more indicative of supply constraint than weakening demand. That's true both in the new home market and the resale market. If you saw the June print, inventory was at 4.3-month supply. It is \u2013 that's very tight. It's up a little bit from the May print, but it's still really tight relative to what's normal. Home prices jumped 5.2% year-over-year, which is a pretty big move. And we kind of consider it to be a trade-off. While existing home turnover, which has been relatively weak, drives repaint activity, these \u2013 the rising home values and rising equity values among stay-in-place homeowners seems to be driving kind of a historic rate of remodeling activity by stay-in-place homeowners. We think baby boomers are kind of leading that parade. If you watch the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, leading indicators were remodeling activity for second quarter 2018, reaching an all-time peak at $324.1 billion, which is up more than 7% year-over-year. And they expect that rate to remain above 7% for the foreseeable future even in just -- like into 2019.","So it's certainly a mixed bag. We'd like to see more existing home turnover, but it doesn't appear to be harming the repaint and remodel market. And as John mentioned earlier, 17 of the last 19 quarters, we've seen double-digit growth in residential repaint. So we're not \u2013 could that be stronger probably? but we're not complaining.","John Morikis","Yeah. To Bob's point and just in traveling with our team, I do hear from residential repaint customers but more so from new residential, commercial and industrial customers as it relates to labor, making the comment that's pretty commonly heard, which is that they could do more work if they had more labor. The net effect of that, if there's a positive, is that they are able to get more pricing into the market, and it's likely prolonging the cycle here. But we continue to hear from our customers the issue of labor.","Christopher Parkinson","That\u2019s very helpful detail. Thank you.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.","Chuck Cerankosky","Good morning, everyone. Related to the last question with regard to the strength in housing values and interest in remodel activity, how about \u2013 how does that affect commercial architectural markets that support increasing household formation?","Bob Wells","I'm not sure I get the question, Chuck. Do you mean how does that support, like, multifamily development?","Chuck Cerankosky","Well, that as well because there's homes for sale but also commercial establishments that might be benefiting from increased household formation in particular areas.","Bob Wells","Got you. One of the constraints in addition to labor that we're seeing in the market that's becoming more and more of an issue is the scarcity of buildable land. It's extremely expensive to develop raw land into buildable land today, which means, to your point; we\u2019re not seeing these communities push out into undeveloped regions of the suburban markets. And hence, there's not as much of the commercial development that springs up around these new communities. Everything from grocery stores to gas stations, movie theaters, schools, hospitals, et cetera, new land development drives development in those projects. What we are seeing, though, that's kind of an offset is more urban core development. Downtown high-rise development is really strong. And in fact, our people tell us that the published data around non-residential starts, non-residential square footage is probably understating what they are seeing in the market.","John Morikis","There\u2019s a number of small and medium-size projects that may not be hitting the radar that our people are tracking.","Chuck Cerankosky","All right. Thank you. Good luck for the rest of the year.","John Morikis","Thank you, Chuck.","Bob Wells","Thank you, Chuck.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Sison","Hi guys. Nice quarter. I think you mentioned adjusted EBITDA for the first half is $1.4 billion, so to think about that on a margin basis, about 16%. Do you think that EBITDA margin improves in the second half of the year versus the first half?","Al Mistysyn","The EBITDA margins should be \u2013 yes, the answer is yes. I believe we should see a slightly better EBITDA margin in the second half versus the first half.","Mike Sison","Great. And then if you think about getting to your 2020 goal of like 19% to 21%, you've still got a way to go there, right? So can you maybe remind us of how you ramp that up in 2019 and into 2020 from this year?","Al Mistysyn","I mean first, you got to start with the demand and the continued above-market demand and sales that we're generating. The price increases that are going in, we'll continue to pursue price increases, working with our customers until we can see some relief in the raw material basket. We're going to still have incremental synergies next year that you talked about. We earned $60 million in 2017 at the midpoint of $150 million, $210 million, and we have a $320 million run rate synergy number coming out of 2018 that we reaffirmed in May at the investor community presentation, I'm reaffirming today.","So now you look at the \u2013 and I would add the Lowe's business that we talked about being accretive going forward from a top-line and bottom-line standpoint. So those are the levers that we're going to continue to push to get to that 2020 goal.","Mike Sison","Great. Thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Byrne","Yes, thank you. What fraction of your sales in your Paint Stores Group, would you characterize as being from customers that are very loyal, buy a large percentage of their paint from Sherwin stores versus another bucket that spread their purchases around and aren't terribly loyal? How would you characterize that split? And of that doubling of the market growth and over 4% volume in the quarter, how would you allocate that between those two buckets?","John Morikis","Yeah, Steve. I would say that maybe half, slightly maybe below half would be what we would call those primary or true loyal customers. So we have a terrific opportunity, we think, to grow share of wallet here. We've got quite a bit of runway there and the other pieces through the opportunities with new accounts. So we're working every one of those angles. Allen","Al Mistysyn","Yeah, Steve. And I would just add and I think you can see those initiatives paying off in our comp store results in our second quarter being up 6.8%.","Steve Byrne","And so what do you do for those \u2013 that just over a half of your sales are from customers that aren't very loyal, how do you change that and change their purchasing behavior?","Al Mistysyn","Well, there is a very detailed program that we probably don\u2019t want to share on a public call of activities that we do see. But rest assured of this: we don't open our stores and hope people come in. We're very aggressive in the pursuit of customers, in trial and having discussions about increasing the value proposition and helping our customers to be more successful in achieving their goals. And we align our people, our products and our services to help our customers reach their goals. That's how we do it.","Steve Byrne","Okay. Thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Thanks for keeping the conference here going, so I can ask the question. Just a quick sort of clarification on the Paint Store Group \u2013 or I'm sorry, the \u2013 not the Paint Store Group, the performance group. It looked like you've closed some branches. I'm assuming that's part of your kind of a longer-term program to streamline your operations, but I just want to make sure that there's nothing more to it than just the rationalization of sites.","John Morikis","No, there's no structural changes. Well, in fact, we're looking at making investments in areas that allow us to serve our customers better.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then on the store additions for The Americas Group, were there any store reductions in Latin America? Or is it just net additions in the U.S.-Canada portion of the business?","Al Mistysyn","Dmitry, we did have some reductions early in the year, but we're -- we should be on pace for additions.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. I\u2019m talking about this particular quarter. So last quarter, you reduced sales \u2013 or reduced the store network by 7, looks like, in Latin America and then increased a little bit in Americas.","Al Mistysyn","Yeah. One store came out of Latin America in the quarter.","Dmitry Silversteyn","So you opened up 19 in the U.S. Okay, that's what I needed to know. And then finally, you've talked about pricing obviously. I don't want to beat a dead horse here. But given that your raw material inflation is a little bit higher, maybe at the higher end of your original expectations, is there a need to get another round of price increases in your company-owned stores? I understand that the DIY channel is its own animal, but just maybe your company-owned stores or the price increases you got at the end of last year, beginning of this year, even with a little bit higher material inflation, you're thinking you're okay on margin until you get to 2019.","Al Mistysyn","Dmitry, and I made this comment earlier. It's a terrific question, and I'm going to just repeat a portion of this, and then I'll expand on it, which is that our historic practice has always been to talk with our customers first and then the investment community. And I do really want to be very clear about the comment I made about our conviction and determination to protect our margins. We just do not want to get in front of the conversations with our customers by having a conversation here today first. So, I\u2019ll just leave it as we are going to protect our margins, and we're going to talk to our customers first. And you can connect the dots from there.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Got you. And then just final question on bookkeeping. The Latin American business, a foreign exchange hit in terms of revenue. Can you \u2013 I mean, you talked about the Americas overall, but in terms of Latin America, how much was foreign exchange a headwind for you in terms of revenue numbers?","Al Mistysyn","It was almost 12% headwind in the quarter, which was a significant change from the first quarter.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Yeah. Okay, yeah, because last quarter, it wasn\u2019t that a bit, okay, almost 12%. Okay, that\u2019s all I had.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks, Dmitry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Speer","Thank you. Just wanted to go back to the discussion on the intermediate-term revenue growth and the EBITDA margin goals that you guys laid out, the roughly 19% to 21%. I just want some \u2013 maybe some help putting context around the midpoint upside of that band and your confidence \u2013 I guess the confidence in achieving the midpoint or the high end of that band at this point. Did any of the current price cost or currency dynamics change or alter your view of achieving the midpoint or the high end of your intermediate-term objectives as we look out?","Al Mistysyn","No. I think we\u2019re not ready to say we\u2019re not going to be able to hit that midpoint. I think the pricing actions that we have in and rolling in across some of the other businesses and looking forward, historically, we've been able to catch up on raw material costs, and we take a short-term hit in our margins. As pricing rolls in and raws roll over along with the other good cost controls and things we do, we're able to expand our operating margins. And we still feel like we are going to be at the midpoint of that range.","John Morikis","Yeah. I think Al's comment in the last call was of reconfirming our position here. We've got work to do, but we clearly see the path, and we're working our plan and expect to be able to reach our goal.","Justin Speer","And the Valspar numbers were the big thing or at least relative to our model with regards to the upside on the revenue profile. Was that like, I guess, a mapping of the synergies coming in maybe sooner than expected? Or is it seasonality? What led to that? And is it going to change potentially the revenue synergy portion of the Valspar synergy targets that you've laid out?","John Morikis","Are you talking \u2013 I just want to make sure we understand the question. Are you talking about the mapping of the value \u2013 or the synergies?","Justin Speer","Well, like for the first two months of the nonorganic piece, the first two months that's not organic was much better. It's like roughly 30-plus better than what you were anticipating. And I know that the underlying core business sounded really good, but at your Analyst Day, you talked of the potential for revenue synergies in this business. And I'm just curious if it's changing your view of the potential of the combined business as you look out over the intermediate term now you've had it for a year in the portfolio.","Al Mistysyn","I think the revenue synergies that David outlined on PCG at the Investor Day were right on. And every month, we have a management meeting, and we \u2013 and every quarter, we review their progress and making those revenue synergies. And as the teams continue to get together, I think more ideas are coming out. And it's just now prioritizing those to make sure we're putting the resources behind the ones we think will have the most impact. And I'd say we're making good progress there.","Justin Speer","Okay. Last question from me, The incremental drag from the accounting change, I don't know if you walked through the impact to all of the segments. I know it was in Consumer Brands. But what were the impacts to the other segments from the accounting change? And relative to the full year guide that you put out, what kind of drag are you looking for, for the year incrementally from the accounting change?","Al Mistysyn","It\u2019s predominantly the Consumer Brands Group. There is no material impact to the other groups. And the year-to-date impact that we called out, it most likely will be close to that number.","Justin Speer","So, about a point hit to the full year, kind of all else equal, from the accounting change?","Al Mistysyn","Maybe, a little less than that, but that's in the ballpark.","Justin Speer","Thank you very much, guys. I appreciate it.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks, Justin.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Nishu Sood","Thank you. Wanted to ask first about the increase in the guidance for the acquisition-related costs, $3.40 to $3.50 to the $3.80 to $3.90 range. I think you laid out in the amortization discussion that it's not there. So just wanted to get a sense of what was driving that.","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Nishu. We finalized the acquisition valuation in this quarter, and it resulted in our reversal of tax benefit that impacted EPS $0.29 a share, that was previously recorded in our fourth quarter. This increased our income taxes, and it was included in transaction and integration costs, as you mentioned, because we wanted to keep the purchase accounting items to incremental D&A only. So to put that in perspective, the transaction and integration costs impacting PBT for the quarter were $39 million, $0.33 a share, then with the deferred tax adjustment, an additional $0.29. That's how we got to the $0.62 that we reported in the quarter. That $0.29 is what's driving that year-to-date or that full year guidance number up. Our core integration costs are about the same. So for the year, just to close the loop on that, our transaction and integration costs impacting PBT were approximately $70 million year-to-date or $0.57 a share, plus the $0.29 per share deferred tax adjustment, you get to $0.86 a share. So we do not expect that $0.29 to repeat, but it does raise the full-year guidance.","Nishu Sood","Got it. Thanks for that. And going back to strong sales performance in Performance Coatings, I think about 60, 70 bps of that was currency related. Very strong performance there. Wanted to understand that a little bit better. I know the average pricing gains you mentioned were in that 2.5% range. Was it a bit stronger as there was the catch-up in Performance Coatings? Or if not, the volume mix, like what was particularly strong? Or what led to the acceleration of what was already a difficult comp for last year?","Al Mistysyn","Well, we touched on this briefly that we're seeing strong volume demand across virtually every product category and nearly every geography. We mentioned that it's led by our packaging business, which is really performing very well, and our general industrial business right behind that. And I think it's partly a function of the fact that we're maintaining really strong supply relationships, as I said, with the right customers. And they're growing their business, and we're growing our business with them. So we're really focused, as I mentioned, on bringing value to our customers, and we're experiencing the reward as a result of that. The teams, as I mentioned earlier, from Valspar were very strong. The teams at Sherwin-Williams are, we believe, very strong. And combined, we're even stronger. We're really excited about the momentum that we have here.","Nishu Sood","Okay. Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks, Justin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Pat Rizzuto with Bloomberg. Please proceed with your question. ","Pat Rizzuto","Good day. It\u2019s Pat Rizzuto with Bloomberg environment. Had a question about what of Valspar's product lines that you've acquired. Is it the Valspar valPure can coatings line? And I'm wondering how it's performing, and I'm also wondering how much of the potential can lining market it has acquired.","John Morikis","Well, we\u2019re not going to get into any of the specific shares of any product line, but I will tell you that the packaging business, as we referenced, is the leading performer in a very strong business. So that business is growing. In total, we grew 11%. Packaging is exceeding that growth. And it's \u2013 the performance that we have right now, we expect it only to continue.","Pat Rizzuto","Great. Thank you very much.","John Morikis","Thank you, Pat.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","John Morikis","Good morning.","Eric Bosshard","Good afternoon. Two things \u2013 the low \u2013 you commented that the expenses were ahead of what you thought in the quarter. Is that timing or a change in the amount that's going to be spent to invest in that program?","John Morikis","It\u2019s just purely timing. The full-year amount has not changed.","Eric Bosshard","Okay. And then secondly, that upside performance drove performance in the second quarter. I know you don't guide by segment, but is it unreasonable to assume you can sustain similar growth as we work through the back half of the year and into 2019? How should we frame our expectations?","Al Mistysyn","Yeah, Eric. I would say we would expect that to continue. And what we even talked about on our Performance Coatings Group is that we \u2013 at the end of the first quarter call, we thought we'd see sequential margin improvement as the year went on. Clearly, we're ahead of that with our operating margin flat year-over-year now. So doing \u2013 we're ahead of plan, but we do still expect to see sequential improvement in that group.","Eric Bosshard","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks, Eric.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Patrick Lambert with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Lambert","Hi, congratulations for this quarter. Just one remaining, and I think it's basically also answered. It's just the $0.40 of Lowe's dilution in 2018 is still valid, if I understand correctly?","Al Mistysyn","Yeah, the $0.40 is still the same.","Patrick Lambert","And could you comment a bit more on 2019 as you see the accretion developing into 2019?","Al Mistysyn","We\u2019re really not going to comment on the Lowe's program going forward, both from a top line or a bottom line, just in respect for our customer.","Patrick Lambert","Understood. Thanks.","Al Mistysyn","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. There were two charges in the quarter, the $0.62 in transition and integration costs and the $0.25 in environmental charges. What was the pretax amount of those two charges combined?","Al Mistysyn","The environmental was around $32 million. The $0.52, Jeff, is $39 million PBT impact in the quarter, which is $0.33, and then the reversal of the deferred tax adjustment of $0.29, that gets you to the $0.52 in the quarter.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And how would you allocate those costs to cost of goods sold or SG&A?","Al Mistysyn","We would have in cost of \u2013 our gross cost of goods sold would have been $17 million. SG&A would have been $22 million. That makes up the $39 million I mentioned. And then the $0.29 is all in the income taxes.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you very much for moving way beyond the 12 o\u2019clock and congratulations on the great quarter. Just looking, going back to the Performance Coatings for a second. Valspar initially had substantially higher margins than Sherwin-Williams. So is this more or less the benefit from the improvement in margin? Or did you see some improvement on the Sherwin piece as well?","Al Mistysyn","Yeah, Rosemarie. It\u2019s hard to break them out, because again, they have gone down the path pretty far of integration. But I would say it's the combined business showing the improvement, which tells you both have to be going forward.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. And then lastly, on the tariff impact on Valspar, and I am referring to wood coatings, which is applied on, let's say, kitchen cabinets, which then come back into the U.S., what are you seeing in that particular area?","John Morikis","Well, we're staying close to the situation and our customers. It's going to be interesting to see exactly how this plays out. As you know, we've got customers and assets on both sides of the water. And we're working with our customers closely to be responsive to whatever happens from a demand standpoint on their side. So we're staying close, and we're going to be adjusting accordingly. I think it's a play that's not been called or completely played out yet, and we'll respond accordingly.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay, thanks. And if I may, actually, I do have one more regarding the amount of work that you may have already done on the Valspar stores in Australia.","John Morikis","Well, we are bringing some of our best practice or we're using our stores as a platform to share information. There's a number of attributes that we think are successful, that help us our \u2013 help us in our success here in North America that we're transferring down there as well as some products. And we're learning a few things from them as well. So the teams are collaborating very well, and we hope that that'll allow us to continue to drive that business forward as well.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. Thank you very much and good luck.","John Morikis","Thanks, Rosemarie.","Operator","Thank you. It appears we have no additional questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.","Bob Wells","Thank you, again, Jessie. As always, I, along with Jim Jaye, our Vice President of IR, will be available over the next few days to handle any additional questions that arise as you digest this morning's call. If you'd like to be placed in the queue for a follow-up call, please call Kristy Johnson at 216-566-3001 and she will add you to the callback schedule. I also want to point out that since our original posting online this morning, we've added a slide to include adjusted EBITDA by quarter. So you might want to visit our website again and pull down that revised slide or that new slide. I'd like to thank you all again for joining us today, and thank you for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time."],"19268":["The Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW) Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call April 16, 2015 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Bob Wells - SVP of Corporate Communications & Public Affairs","John Morikis - President and COO","Chris Connor - Chairman and CEO","Sean Hennessy - CFO and SVP of Finance","Al Mistysyn - VP, Corporate Controller","Analysts","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W.

An archived replay of this webcast will be available at the www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two-hours after this conference call concludes, and will be available until Wednesday, May 06, at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. After the review of the first quarter results, we will open the session for questions.","I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.","Bob Wells","Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're going to begin the call this morning as usual with a brief recap of first quarter 2015 results, by John Morikis, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Then Chris Connor, our Chairman and CEO, will provide some perspective on the quarter and our expectations for second quarter and full year. Following their remarks, we will open the call to questions, and Sean Hennessy, our Chief Financial Officer and Al Mistysyn, Vice President, Corporate Controller, are with us this morning, to participate in the Q&A session.","Before I pass the microphone to John, let me remind you that this conference call will include certain forward-looking statements, as defined under U.S. Federal Securities Laws, with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.","A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided on our earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. In the interest of time, we've also provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our Web site, www.sherwin.com, under the Investor Relations tab, first quarter press release.","With that, let me turn the call over to John to review our performance for the first quarter.","John Morikis","Thanks Bob. If you\u2019ve listened to our earning calls over the past few quarters, you may detect the familiar pattern in today\u2019s release. Once again, in the first quarter, we saw good momentum in most of our domestic businesses and less favorable results from our non-domestic operations.","I\u2019ll begin by highlighting overall Company performance for first quarter 2015, compared to first quarter 2014, then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased 3.5% to a record of $2.45 billion, driven primarily by higher paint sales volumes in our Paint Stores and Consumer Groups. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 3.1% in the quarter.","Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $56.5 million in the quarter to $1.13 billion. Our consolidated gross margin increased 120 basis points in the quarter to 46.2% of sales, from 45% in the first quarter last year. Most of the gross margin improvement in this quarter resulted from higher sales by Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, and increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume.","Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $45.1 million over first quarter last year to $929.2 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 37.9% in the first quarter this year from 37.4% last year, due primarily to the incremental investments in the Lowe\u2019s rollout.","Interest expense decreased $4 million compared to the first quarter last year to $12.4 million. This decrease was due to the rate difference between the $500 million and five-year notes we retired in fourth quarter of 2014, and the comparable increases in our short-term borrowings.","Consolidated profit, before taxes in the quarter, increased $27.2 million to $193.2 million due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter this year was 32% compared to 30.5% in the first quarter of 2014. For the full year of 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30s compared to the last year\u2019s rate of 31.2%. ","Consolidated net income increased $15.9 million to $131.4 million. Net income, as a percent of sales, was 5.4% compared to 4.9% in the first quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 21% to $1.38 per share from $1.14 per share in 2014.","Now, looking at our results by operating segments. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter of 2015 increased 7.5% to $1.46 billion from $1.36 billion last year. Comparable store sales, sales by stores opened more than 12-calendar months, increased 6.4%. All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic paint and equipment sales volumes across all end-markets. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter.","Regionally in the quarter, our Midwestern Division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern Division, Eastern Division and our Southwestern Division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. Segment profit for the Group increased $30.3 million or 20.7% to $176.6 million in the quarter, as higher paint and equivalent sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 12.1% of sales from 10.8% in the first quarter of last year.","For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales decreased 8.9% to $156.2 million due to unfavorable currency translation that was partially offset by selling price increases. Volumes in the quarter were slightly positive but currency translation rate changes decreased sales in the U.S. dollars by 13.9% in the quarter.","Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to $9.5 million in the quarter from $10 million last year. Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit by $3.4 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 5.7% in the quarter compared to 5.5% in the first quarter of 2014.","Now, turning to Consumer Group. First quarter sales increased 8.1% to $351.7 million due primarily to the initial shipment for the HGTV HOME by Sherwin Williams paint program to Lowe\u2019s stores. Segment profits for the Consumer Group increased $4.3 million to $55.4 million in the quarter from $51.1 million in the first quarter of last year.","The profit improvement in the quarter was due primarily to increased operating efficiencies that were partially offset by higher SG&A spending related to the HGTV HOME rollout. Segment profit, as a percent of external sales, increased to 15.8% from 15.7% in the same period last year. ","For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 5.6% to $459.6 million in the quarter, as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by higher selling prices. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 6.9% in the quarter.","First quarter segment profit stated in U.S. dollars, decreased $7.6 million or 16.3% to $38.9 million due primarily to unfavorable currency translation rate changes which decreased segment profit $4.4 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit decreased to 8.3% from 9.3% in the same period last year.","That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I'll turn the call over the Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the second quarter and full year. Chris?","Chris Connor","Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. First quarter was a good quarter from a profit perspective, but revenue clearly came in a little below our expectations.","This is largely a result of two factors; the impact of unfavorable currency translations on sales was a little worse than we anticipated in our guidance; and HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams shipments to Lowe's in the quarter, were slightly lower than we expected, due entirely the timing. This combination reduced revenue growth in the quarter by a little more than 150 basis points versus our guidance. But neither of these factors affect our expectations for the full year in anyway. We remain bullish in our outlook, for both sales and earnings, as we were in January.","From a profitability standpoint, earnings per share in the quarter grew 21% and consolidated sales growth to 3.5%. Our incremental margin and consolidated profit before tax was more than 32%. And as a percent of sales, gross profit expanded to 120 basis points, operating profit margin improved 60 basis points and profit before tax improved 90 basis points.","SG&A was the only line in the P&L that went to wrong in the quarter, and that was by design to support the rollout of HGTV HOME at Lowe's. Both of our domestic operating segments reported solid sales and profit results in the quarter. Paint Stores Group got-off to a strong start in January and a soft patch in February, but regained their momentum in late March.","Comparable store sales growth of 6.4% in the quarter, overcame the drag from the 283 Comex stores, now embedded in the comp. We\u2019re encouraged by the fact that the locations we\u2019ve converted to the Sherwin-Williams format have shown immediate improvement in DIY and residential repaint business, the two highest gross margin customer segments.","During the quarter, Paint Stores Group opened 21 new stores and closed 14 redundant Comex locations. Our plan still calls for full year store openings in the range of 100 net new locations. ","Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and Caribbean, stands at 4,010 locations compared to 3,925 one year-ago. Consumers Group\u2019s 8.1% sales increase and 10 basis point improvements in segment profit margin in the quarter, both reflect the impact of the HGTV HOME load-ins at Lowe's. If you back out the Lowe's shipments, the Group\u2019s core sales in the quarter were roughly flat year-over-year.","The profit margin and incremental sales was only 16.4% due to higher SG&A spending to support the HGTV HOME rollout. Our Global Finishes Group and Latin America Coatings Group got-off to a slow start for the year due in part to unfavorable currency translations and in part the soft-end market demand. Both segments, however, reported positive sales volumes in the quarter, but by indeed fall a little short of offsetting negative currency impact.","In spite of the inventory build to support the Lowe's program, our working capital ratio decreased to 10.9% from 11% in the first quarter of last year. If you back out the effect of the Lowe's rollout, working capital of sales would have been about 10% at the end of the quarter. The reduction in working capital, combined with the increase in net income, more than offset the incremental cash used for Comex store integration and the HGTV HOME rollout in the quarter. As a result, net operating cash in the quarter improved by approximately $28 million compared to our first quarter cash performance last year.","During the quarter, we acquired 2.0 million shares of the Company stock, or treasury, at an average cost of $287.75 per share for a total investment of $575.5 million. On March 31st, we had remaining authorization to acquire 3.23 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors, approved a quarterly dividend of $0.67 per share, up 22% from the $0.55 we paid last year.","Our outlook for raw materials continues to evolve as we get further into the year. The drop in petrochemical feedstock prices, combined with steadily improving monomer supply will likely result in declining latex and resin prices in the back-half of the year.","At the same time, high grade chloride titanium dioxide pricing has softened a bit from recent quarters due to continued weakness in global demand and excess supply. From these developments, we expect average year-over-year raw material cost for the industry to be down in the mid single-digit range in 2015 compared with low single-digit outlook we gave in our year-end 2014 call.","As I commented in my opening remarks, we remain optimistic that U.S. residential demand for architectural paint will continue to strengthen as we move into the prime painting season. And we\u2019re encouraged by growing signs of the robust commercial recovery. This growth will continue to be offset to some degree by challenging conditions in Latin America and currency headwinds, particularly in the first half of the year.","Our outlook for the second quarter of 2015 is for consolidated net sales to increase 6% to 8% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.90 per share, nearly a 30% increase at the midpoint compared to last year\u2019s record $2.94 per share.","For the full year 2015, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2014 by a high single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are reaffirming our expectations for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $10.90 to $11.10 per share, compared to $8.78 per share apparent in 2014.","Again, we\u2019d like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi","First up, can you just touch on the competitive environment in the paint industry in the U.S.? Just anecdotally listening to your lot more of promotional focus this year across many channels. Just wondering what you're seeing.","Chris Connor","Ghansham, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re seeing any more aggressive promotional activity than we would typically would at this time of year, and we\u2019re kind of entering into the start of the paint season. And that\u2019s pretty typical for our industry to -- and send traffic and value them with promotions, pricings are holding as you can tell by our margin improvement. So, I think it's pretty much business as usual.","Ghansham Panjabi","And then just in terms of the timing that you called on the HGTV load-in. Can you just kind of give us some more color on that, what drove the shifts specifically?","Chris Connor","So, we\u2019re very pleased and confident in the rollout and in our revision of product projections. And what\u2019s happened here is that we gave some initial thoughts on how this thing would rollout. The quarter happened to land in the midst of a pretty major rollout. So, there are some stores that are shipping week, maybe two-weeks later than the original plan. But it's nothing we\u2019re concerned with, and we\u2019re very confident of the direction and the rollout and way it's going.","Ghansham Panjabi","And just one final one if I could on what you're seeing if anything different on wage inflation for your U.S. stores? I\u2019ll leave at that. Thanks so much.","Chris Connor","Our wage inflation has been pretty standard for a long time Ghansham, based on a formula we look at given the current market and industries we adjust our annual compensation. Those wages have increased on average 2% to 3% per year for our employee base for many years as they will again this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John McNulty","So with regards to your 2Q guide, it's implying pretty significant lift in the margin on a year-over-year basis on the operating side. So I guess I am wondering, if you can walk us through some of the puts and takes on that. Is it just, you finally have the Lowe\u2019s platform out and ramps up or I guess how much if its being -- is it just the end of some of the Comex headwinds from last year? I guess if you could kind of walk us through some of the major puts and takes that really give you confidence to hit that kind of a margin level that\u2019d be helpful?","Sean Hennessy","This is Sean Hennessy. Good morning. When you look at the second quarter and when you look at that guidance going from 294 to the midpoint of 380, our margins, I don\u2019t think you can get into that kind of the range with that kind of sales gain, without having margin expansion. And the operating margin expansion I think it's going to be -- you're going to see margin expansion in the gross profit line and I think that you're going to see some efficiencies in the SG&A line.","The only way you can get there so -- but I think, we\u2019re coming over, coming against the Comex integration. We feel really good about the Comex integration and this is where the business is at. I mean, we feel very good, if we can get gallon. It\u2019s also has to do with the sales curve in the second quarter and in the third quarter, the Stores Group in Consumer will be a larger percentage of our total sales.","So a couple of things happened there; number one, we\u2019ve always said an incremental gallon in those two groups, are the best incremental gallon flow through as we have in the Company; and number two, even though foreign currency is going to be a headwind in the second and third quarter with the sales curve again outside the country be in a smaller percentage of the total, that headwind will actually be smaller in the second and third quarter. It comes back in the fourth quarter.","So, all those things are working in that direction. And I think operationally, the Store Group is in great shape and the Consumer Group is in great shape. And they are going to lead the profit improvement in the second and third quarter.","John McNulty","And then maybe just one follow-up question. With regard to the HGTV rollout, when we think about the actual cost and how they sequence in throughout the year. I guess how should we\u2019d be thinking about kind of the lumpiness of that as you\u2019re ramping this up, do we see a lot in the first quarter and then it went down or do we just see a lot and then it starts to get offset more by revenues coming in, like how should we think about that?","Sean Hennessy","I think couple of things there, the last quarter I mentioned that we have 12-months of SG&A because it can\u2019t just turn on our organization in mid-March. And we had nine and half months with the sale. So, the first quarter because it is the smallest quarter, the SG&A impact was the greatest and that's why you saw in the first quarter our SG&A was 5 times higher than last year.","In the second quarter, there is a lot of advertising, and lot of SG&A promotions going on in that second quarter. And then you\u2019re going to start seeing the SG&A flat now. And so -- and I think from the expense, second quarter maybe is a largest actually. But the first quarter is probably the most, the toughest comparison for us. And then you will see the SG&A get to a more normal running rate in the third quarter and fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks very much and good morning everyone. Just had a question, if you we could sort of try to bridge this full year from here and your guidance stay the same. It sounds like in the quarter, you felt like your volumes could have been a little bit better. You had the issue with the buy-in at Lowe\u2019s and now you\u2019re saying that FX is obviously worse, raw materials are going to be better across the balance of the year. So, could you just kind of help us understand what's in treating the guidance the same, what are the things like on an underline basis, what's gotten better, what's gotten worse? And if you shift-out some of the things that are outside of your controls, is the year progressing, the same or better or worse than you expected three-months ago?","Chris Connor","I think you did a great job for answering that question.","Vincent Andrews","Well. I'm looking for some dimension on those issues, not just the high level?","Chris Connor","We began the year with pretty robust guidance EPS in the 25% plus ranges and strong domestic volume and none of those things have changed for us at all. I think some of these issues are a little bit around the fringe on us. FX is definitely more of a headwind than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. But as you know this is a Company that remains primarily a U.S. focused revenues story.","So for that end, it will be an impact for us but a lumpy that much, offsetting that is a little better raw material forecast than we had given you to begin with, we\u2019ve plans for good raw material favorable impact, it's getting a little bit better than that. So, you put a couple of those little marginal puts and takes together, the real driver, as Sean just commented, will be the strong results that we're expecting from our Stores Group, the Consumer Group, in North America in 2015.","Vincent Andrews","Okay, and if I could just ask a follow up. You mentioned that it's related to your Store business that south west was the richest evolved and was that -- is there any particular reason for that or is there anything notable about that or is that just kind of stacked up?","John Morikis","It's interesting that you pointed that out. If you noticed also, that Midwestern was the leading division and this time a year, it's obviously our Midwestern Division leading. Clearly, some of the weather that impacted south west had a direct impact on their sales. We don't like to talk about weather. We keep our heads down and drive our sales. But it clearly in that Division had an impact.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","P.J. Juvekar","Couple of questions on HGTV, can you talk about the initial reception of the paints in the stores or is it too early? And what would be the margins on this product compared to your Consumer Group average?","Chris Connor","So, I\u2019ll give you some thoughts P.J. and kind of the early run rate and let Sean comment on the margins that at least what we\u2019re prepared to say. As John mentioned, we're really right in the middle of this rollout. May 1st is the official and national rollout day. We will absolutely be set in every store and ready to go. I\u2019d say we probably have two-thirds of the store set at this point [John]. And so we are starting to see some really strong reorders and excitement inside the aisles at Lowe\u2019s stores.","The color merchandising unit that is gone in and it's been terrific, it's really creating quite a stir. And so, I would say that from every angle that we can look at it this program is really on track with our expectations and off to a good start.","Sean P. Hennessy","And what we've said P.J. about the operating margin, the only thing we've commented on is a couple of things. Number one, we're not going to put out a P&L by customer, we never have loaded a customer P&L and we really are not going to start doing that. But what we have done is said that this program during the calendar year 2015 will give us low single-digit increase for the Company.","Last year our sales were around -- were just slightly over $11 billion and that gives you an idea of what kind of sales we have in our guidance. But when it comes to operating margins, we've said at the beginning with slightly dilutive in the fourth quarter for some of the expenses and it will be slightly accretive in the calendar year 2015. And then we're going to see much a nice pop in our operating margins in 2016. And that's really all we\u2019re really prepared to say.","P.J. Juvekar","And Chris in the past you had talked about your global ambitions and making acquisitions outside the U.S. with a strong dollar, it seems like a good time. Can you just talk about your price line and what are your thoughts about that? ","Chris Connor","I think we've been very open P.J. with our investment community regarding our appetite here. We have a strong interest and continuing to strengthen our architectural coatings platform throughout Latin America. And we talk about our industrial coatings businesses on a more of a global basis. And so, there are a number of interesting ideas that we\u2019re discussing. And at the right time, we\u2019ll be happy to let you know about them.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","Two questions, first on consumer, Sean I think on the last call you said that operating margins were actually declining year-over-year because of the cost of the HGTV rollout and yet you\u2019re slightly higher. So I\u2019m just wondering what went on consumer to offset that from a margin standpoint? And then secondly, just wondering on sort of you Q2, Q3 paint season, what are your contractor customers telling you in terms of their bookings outlook, both on residential and non-residential?","Sean Hennessy","Don, I would tell you probably one of the very nice surprises was the ability for our Consumer Group to have operating margin improvement. And I think there is two pieces, there was the piece on the selling side. But on the manufacturing and the logistics side, they had a very good quarter. And because of that ability, they actually were able to have a operating margin $0.01 higher this year than last year. But they were helped by the incremental gallons that they were producing and so forth -- and they put some of those gallons on our balance sheet, which took a little debit and put it on there that you didn\u2019t see come up in the second quarter. But that\u2019s what really drove the operating margins in the first quarter to be one-time higher.","Chris Connor","I will take the question regarding the contractors and how they\u2019re feeling. And I would describe it as very bullish. I\u2019ve been around the country and in talking with our people as well as our customers. There is a very strong level of confidence. There is a very high level of bid activity. And they\u2019re very excited about this year. Our non-paint sales of spray equipment and related sales are very-very strong. And that\u2019s all tied to the confidence that they have in the market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Good morning. In Paint Stores, will you comment on how your spray equipment volumes would have compared to the segment average same store sales figure 6.4%?","Chris Connor","Our spray equipment sales are extremely strong, very strong.","Kevin McCarthy","Double-digits, perhaps?","Sean Hennessy","Yes.","Kevin McCarthy ","Okay. Good to know. Thank you. Then second question for Sean, if I may, typically your net debt balance expands seasonally it seems in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. But this year the jump was roughly double what you\u2019ve been running historically. Would you comment on that and what might be driving it?","Sean Hennessy","I can tell you a very quick that we just added here an accelerated factory purchase in ASR in the first quarter. So in the month of February, as John commented, we did purchase 2 million of shares in the first quarter. We did that use in an ASR. And so that\u2019s why, you saw a use of cash of approximately $585 million. So in the last few years, we\u2019ve been a little more cautious in buying stock in the first quarter. But this year, when we were looking at the cash generation of the Company and what we\u2019re going to do with the cash, we feel very good and we want the 2 million shares. At the end of the year, we still believe that our debt, our total debt will be in that one-to-one range with our EBITDA.","Kevin McCarthy","And last one if I may, it sounded like the HGTV load-in was running slightly later than you\u2019ve previously anticipated. But other than that, were there any March to April timing shifts that you would consider noteworthy?","John Morikis","I don\u2019t think there is anything noteworthy in that. And I\u2019d like to just be really clear on that HGTV. We have some projections on how this would rollout. And this is just simple matter of having some areas that we\u2019d planned on moving a week or a couple of days in some cases just falling on the other side of line of the quarter. So, to be clear, not sending the wrong signal here it\u2019s just a matter of very simple timing and where the quarter landed in the midst of this rollout. So it\u2019s according to understand now as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan","Just wondering if you can give us an update on what you\u2019re seeing I guess earlier on the spring paint season to safely get out as we expected. Thanks.","John Morikis","We expected a strong start to the season and our contractors would tell you that they\u2019re very excited about that. There is a strong pipeline of this as I mentioned earlier and there is a good feeling about that. I think many of the contractors experienced a little bit of delay in some of those projects starting with some of the weather that they face. So, we\u2019re excited about paint season.","Chris Connor","And Arun, to clear a little context around that, the American Coatings Association came out with their forecast of volumes for 2014 and \u201915, a couple of days ago, and their outlook for this year is for annual growth of 5.6%, but first quarter growth in more in the 3% range. So, they kind of anticipated a slow start but a really strong season to follow.","Arun Viswanathan","And just some clarification on the industry numbers, and would that bring us closer to kind of a normal level of gallonage in 750 million range or where do you think we are tracking on the year?","Chris Connor","No, they actually took their 2014 number down a little bit. We\u2019ve been talking about 2014, 3.5% growth year. They actually knock that down to about 2.5% or 2.8%. So, they finished the year in the range of about 720 million gallon. If you put 5% on top of that, we\u2019re still not back to where we think this cycle is going to peak, or even normalize with that.","Arun Viswanathan","And then just as a last follow-up. Can you differentiate any activity in new construction versus repair and remodeling, and how the two segments are going? Thanks.","Chris Connor","Historically, repair remodel has been about 80% of the industry. So, a smaller percentage increase in that segment will move the needle on gallons a lot further. Repair and remodel, we covered earlier than new construction, it has remained strong. We\u2019ve commented for a while now that residential repaint is the strongest growth category that we\u2019ve seen. But if you look at that, the numbers particularly in the housing market year-to-date this year, we\u2019ve seen really strong activity in new home sales.","So in fact permits have actually lagged sales so withdrawn inventories down, we would expect a very robust building season in the spring, given that the inventories are as low as they are now. So, repaint has led the pack, but new home constructions will be a strong contributor this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Koort","I wonder if you guys could help describe for me when a consumer comes into a Lowe\u2019s, what is the selling proposition to HGTV brand, what is the differentiator there and maybe what fits on that price point scale?","John Morikis","When you walk into a Lowe\u2019s store Bob, you're going to see immediately the impressive color presentation at the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams makes. That really starts the shopping experience, those color centers are at the end of their drive aisles, they\u2019re close to the very entry points to their stores, a good number of Lowe stores that we\u2019ve been in since the rollout has begun.","We were able to pick out that color center literally with the assessment time to store. So, I think that\u2019s going to create excitement and impressions for the department. Once the consumers made that choice, if it's an HGTV color, then they are inclined to look for the HGTV product and then Lowe\u2019s associates will be trained to help them make that. I think as we\u2019ve commented in the past that both Valspar and PPG remain in the department. They will have product offerings as well too.","So this will be a typical experience for all the boxes in managing multi-supplier lines in the department, and it\u2019ll be the merchandizing and quality and then the association will help drive that preference for HGTV HOME.","Chris Connor","The confidence factors, I think with the colors are lesser and the coordinating of the colors is another compelling feature of the HGTV. So the consumer with confidence can choose the color as well as coordinating colors go along with that.","Bob Koort","And do you guys -- well you\u2019ve completed by May 1 on the ground training at every Lowe\u2019s location?","Chris Connor","Absolutely.","Bob Koort","And then last thing real quick if I may. You mentioned Latin America raw material inflation. Could you describe what was going on there in the context of expectations for deflation on the horizon?","Chris Connor","The majority of the raw materials are price in U.S. dollar, so when the currency devalues it's in fact always a raw material increase for the different countries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Nils Wallin","First off, I was wondering if you could size the accretion that you might have seen from Comex this quarter.","Chris Connor","This integration is going great. And I think that what we\u2019ve said is last year we\u2019re at $0.28 and for the year we\u2019re going to be at $0.10. We feel it's going to be here. But as it is so integrated now, where we don\u2019t feel confident on a quarter-by-quarter basis to give you that kind of detail, so that\u2019s why I think we\u2019ve said that in the future, we\u2019re not going to be commenting on this acquisition.","Nils Wallin","I am curious there wasn\u2019t -- I mean paint stores is usually pretty much a U.S. dollar type business. But obviously with Comex coming in, there is heavier Canadian footprint and the Canadian dollar did depreciate year-over-year. So, was there any sort of FX headwinds in the Paint Stores group?","Chris Connor","Yes, you're exactly right, with the Canadian sales in the Paint Store Group. There was some headwinds but we break-out the 3.1% for the Company we don't break it out to that by the segments.","Nils Wallin","And then you just mentioned in the previous question about the raw materials in Lat-Am being priced in dollars, so that sounds like it\u2019s a transactional type FX effect. Is there any opportunity for you to switch that or buy more locally to offset those FX headwinds going forward?","Chris Connor","Not on the major titanium dioxide and some of the other major resins and so forth. So, that's the situation we're in. There are some -- a small percentage of the raw that we do buy it locally, but not enough to offset that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn","I\u2019d just like to tie up a couple of outstanding questions that I have. In the Global Group, could you provide a little bit of a granularity between volume and pricing, what the components of revenue was outside of FX?","Chris Connor","What we've said is that if you think about it, we said that our sales were down 5.5% and we said that our gallons were up slightly. So, that we did quick pricing in there in the local currencies, but not enough to offset the currency hit. But the volume is up slightly.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay and the price increases, was that mainly -- this is both for Latin American and the global group. The price increases that you mentioned, that was mainly to offset the deflation in the currencies, I would imagine?","Chris Connor","Yes.","Dmitry Silversteyn","In terms of your guidance for the year, it sounds like with increased foreign exchange headwinds you\u2019re nevertheless looking for high single-digit growth for the year sort of reported sales, so it sounds like the organic sales growth expectations have improved. Is that a correct read through and sort of what is behind that? Is it just the optimism in the stores business with the contractors benefiting from commercial construction, or are there other drivers to your more upbeat expectations for organic performance in 2015?","Chris Connor","You\u2019re right I think everything you said that was accurate. We still believe that for the full year we\u2019re going to make it, and we also pleased that foreign currency is going to be a slightly stronger headwind than we get three months ago. I will tell you, we still remained pretty confident in that range, because as I tried to point out the 3.1% is very strong in the first quarter. Even if the currency remains exactly the headwinds in the second quarter and third quarter, that number should reduce.","So -- and I would say you have to remember, if we did have some foreign currency devaluation in the guidance already, so that's frequent 1% with that 100% incremental, we did have some. So it's just that incremental piece. And when you look at the range of let's say 7% and 9% that 2% on $11 billion $220 million we still feel that we're in pretty good shape to get inside that range.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Got it, got it. And then the final question, you talk about raw material sales in the mid-single digits for 2015. You also mentioned that you expect that to really take place in the second half of 2015. So are we to interpret from that that second half 2015 may see more like a double-digit decline in raw material cost for the year on your basis?","Bob Wells","I don't think so Dmitry, this is Bob. I don't think it will be that strong. We\u2019ll have to see, I think the linchpin is going to be TiO2. We\u2019ll have to see what happens with TiO2 in the back-half. But I would say that back-half will likely be in the mid maybe upper mid single-digits.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. So, the back half will be mid to high single-digits. Okay. Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s all the questions I had.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Dennis McGill","Good morning guys. Thank you. First one, Chris, you had mentioned I think -- the term used in February was a low in February and I think you said that it took until the second half of March to pick up, just want to confirm that the first half of March looked more like February? And then if you could maybe just frame a little bit what was the difference between what you saw kind of exiting the quarter and what you were seeing during that low Period?","Chris Connor","That\u2019s exactly why we [multiple speakers]. Yeah, sure Dennis. That is exactly what we said. February was a soft month for us and March started little softer, February started to pick up. But Sean made a brief comment about weather in the quarter, as we started to see some warmer days, we really were seeing the acceleration of all this confidence that -- and back there which is professional and training contractor.","I think what's notable is that it's winter in the first quarter. It's supposed to be cold and Boston supposed to have the kind of snow at head, and we had stores closed, et cetera. That really wasn't the impact. It was the cold south of the Mason Dixon line that really had the impact. And just as we commented about our Southwestern division kind of lagging a division it typically lead to that time of the year. When we got some warm weather in those parts of the geography, we really started to see it's a rebound. And now that we're into the second quarter, weather really diminishes, has been impacted. And again back to the strong guidance we're giving there.","Dennis McGill","And I guess just indirectly, the guidance you\u2019re giving on the sales on an organic base in the second quarter sort of suggests Paint Stores sales are getting back to that high single-digit rate?","Chris Connor","Correct.","Dennis McGill","Okay. And then separately on the global side, I think when you back out FX, this quarter was modest growth and I think there\u2019s something more in the four, five range recently. Can you just talk to where do you think that continues and if so just give some color on what you see in different geographies and different end users?","John Morikis","The performance by business unit varied. And not surprisingly, our business in North America across every category was stronger than a relatively weaker performance in Latin America and Europe. And obviously part of that was due to the currency. We expect in local currency for these businesses to improve. And over the balance of the year, we feel we\u2019ll get on top of it. So, we\u2019re confident about the year and the projections we\u2019ve given you.","Dennis McGill","Okay.","Chris Connor","In Latin America Dennis in the first quarter, we had volume gains in every country quarter with the exception of Brazil and it\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve seen that, so we currently feeling better about our prospect there as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Melich","I want to follow up quickly on SG&A, just to make sure I have this right. So, if you haven\u2019t had the HGTV program with SG&A levered in the first quarter, and if you were to think about it going forward, we do expect the lever, the corporate basis in the second quarter but probably not in consumers. Did I summarize that right, Sean?","Sean Hennessy","Yes, the only thing that we didn\u2019t had say is that we would have shown some efficiencies in the first quarter with SG&A. Without that I think that we don\u2019t want to break that out. And the reason we don\u2019t want to do that is that how much we spend exactly on the Lowe\u2019s program. But we would not have had the 5 times of increase in SG&A.","Greg Melich","It would have gone the right way. It would have been down, we don\u2019t know how much?","Sean Hennessy","Yes.","Greg Melich","And then the follow up, I want to talk a little bit more about the outlook there. I know we\u2019ve talked about resi and it looks greater there in the contractors. What about commercial and industrial? What sort of region you see there? Is there any sort of project work going on or is that not dialed up or is that just sort of as planned?","Bob Wells","No in fact -- Greg this is Bob, there is a quite bit of project work going on. And due to the long start to paint cycle in the non-residential space, you kind of got to look back a year or more at the data. And if you look at 2014 data in terms of signed contracts, non-residential rebounded pretty strongly, up about 7% in total with -- as we\u2019ve pointed before, some really strong categories in office and bank, hotel and motel, manufacturing, et cetera.","And so there are certainly -- there is certainly growth across the country. There are specific categories that we can target to grow faster than the market in total. And by the way, those were contract, I just talked about, but we also a big jump in starts in the fourth quarter of '14. There is lot of projects coming out of the ground that will be painted this year. So, it\u2019s looking a lot better than last year. And that\u2019s mostly driven by occupancy rate, which also implies that the retail market will be strong in non-residential this year.","Greg Melich","And then lastly I know it\u2019s early. But what do you expect the HGTV program at Lowe\u2019s to do to the program in your own Paint Stores Group? Do you expect it to help to hurt anything in there in terms of your plan will be helpful.","Chris Connor","The HGTV HOME program inside the Sherwin-Williams Paint Stores Group format is not significant contributor to our overall revenue. Having said that, we think the additional exposure for the brand, the additional advertising, some of the upgraded color features and labeling which will impact both the Sherwin store offering as well as Lowe\u2019s store, will have a positive impact. So, it should be marginally better to flat, will be our expectation.","Greg Melich","And Chris is there a lag to that do you think or do you anything it sort of happened over the advertising, et cetera, kicks in or is it -- ?","Chris Connor","I think we\u2019ll see in the second and third quarter when we really expect the ramp up, the marketing activity type.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ivan Marcuse","Just a couple of quick questions, I believe your gross margin range, typically -- I think you said it past couple of quarters, 43 to 47 with the lower gross margin, with lower raw materials. Do you expect to exceed that range this year or would you expect to sort of move that range overtime as that impacted the additional volume that you\u2019ve gotten over the past couple of quarters?","John Morikis","Ivan, you are absolutely right. We believe that this range, we recently we talked about the 43 to 46, 44 to 47, we think we\u2019re really in a 44.5 to 47.5. I would tell you that would be the range that I would give today.","Ivan Marcuse","Okay, great. And then you mentioned there is whether every year, which there is. I\u2019m curious have you seen any impact of the lower oil costs hitting the economies, the tax authority any other energy impacts in terms of construction or housing or anything to that effect?","John Morikis","Not really. I mean we\u2019ve spent some time with our team down there and they\u2019re feeling pretty good about the marketplace. So there has not been any impact in our increase down there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Jay McCanless","First question I had, I am trying to catch up with Comex and how many of those stores are now part of the actual comp group to make up your comp store sales for the Paint Stores?","Sean Hennessy","283.","Jay McCanless","On a percentage basis of the store you acquired, where does that stand?","Sean Hennessy","So we have required 306 of 283 so that makes 306 is about 93.5%.","Jay McCanless","It's a meaningful part of the comp group at this point, you're not going to get any more catch-up from the stores rolling in.","Chris Connor","We have approximately close of 4,000 comp store. So, there are 283 of the 4,000 stores, it's half of 1%, I am sorry I thought you were asking a question of how many remaining.","John Morikis","September of \u201913 right, so they are fully in the comp number that\u2019s a point we\u2019re making.","Chris Connor","Jay, do you mean, what percentage have we converted to Sherwin stores?","Jay McCanless","No, I wanted to see if they were part of the comp group already, now you already answered that. My other question is on SG&A in 2Q \u201914, is there any one-time items in there that aren\u2019t going to reappear this year just trying to frame our model for how SG&A is going to look.","Chris Connor","When you look at that SG&A with 31.8% and $970 million, it really was one-time only.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.","Chuck Cerankosky","You covered a lot of ground. But the one thing I want to ask you John is it looks like CapEx bumps up quite a bit year-over-year in the first quarter. Is there anything going on there?","Sean Hennessy","Chuck, we said that our CapEx would be high this year, around 220 million to 240 million. And what we\u2019re doing is converting those Comex stores that\u2019s what\u2019s driving it this year. So, as those conversions occur, we\u2019re continuing to spend approximately $100,000 per store and that\u2019s an ongoing cost.","Chuck Cerankosky","Will you get them all done this year?","Chris Connor","Go ahead John.","John Morikis","We\u2019ll get most of them done and the largest part of it. There will be some perhaps in Canada that\u2019ll roll-over and maybe a little bit out on the West Coast. But largest part we\u2019ll get it mostly done.","Chuck Cerankosky","And finally, any other significant projects in the CapEx budget for 2015?","Chris Connor","No, I think that\u2019s the major take there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Can you remind us what percentage of Sherwin-Williams\u2019 consolidated sales are non-paints or non-coatings?","Chris Connor","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever given that dynamic. I think we\u2019ve talked about the stores and so forth. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever given any. And the reason why is because it diversify, and we have brushes and rollers, we have costs and so forth. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever given that metric.","John Morikis","We\u2019ve given you some directional help there Jeff. I think we say our stores are 70%, 75% coating sales, the rest of the spray equipment, et cetera. Our Consumer Group would be probably same range 60%, 70% range in coatings, brushes and rollers or you consider us all paints, paints or specialty and that might be a different way to look at it. But in all our Global Finishes Group it would be coatings.","Jeff Zekauskas","And then secondly, do you think that there will be any sequential change in your overall prices or for the industry in 2Q or 3Q? Has the general price outlook appear on a sequential basis?","Sean Hennessy","No, we think that if you look at the selling prices, there is a lot of activity going on. But pricing has been fairly stable. Just to remind you the last time we put a price increase in, it was early January 2014.","Jeff Zekauskas","And then lastly, what\u2019s the size of the DIY business in the stores? And will the consumer say, I can get Sherwin-Williams paint at Lowe\u2019s, I really don\u2019t need to get it out the stores. Do you think that there might be a trade-off for the consumer or no?","John Morikis","We\u2019ve been consistently at about 15% of that Paint Stores Group revenue [indiscernible] the DIY consumer. We don\u2019t expect that to change substantially one way or the other.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey McKinney with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Geoffrey McKinney","Just a follow-up on the share repurchase side. The utilization of short-term debt to fund that acceleration, should we think about the balance sheet kind of sustain a normal debt balance, that coming down or being refined and termed out? I'm just curious how we should think about that going forward.","Chris Connor","I think you should think about that it's going to come down our launch is at the end of the quarter it will be the first quarter. I also think, you should think about turning this out. We\u2019re looking at issuing some bonds this year the timing is not exactly public yet because we haven\u2019t decided exactly when. One of the things about it, you've seen our interest rate was -- our interest expense was 4 million less than the first quarter than last year, which is positive. Because when we did -- when the bonds matured, our five-year bonds matured in 2014, we did that re-issue. But we\u2019re so heavy into short-term debt I think as I said earlier I think our debt by the end of the year will be in that one-to-one range of EBITDA and you will see fixed notes in a much higher percentage of our total debt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts","Just in under the wire here. Good morning, guys. You're off to a slow start in the new store openings here. It\u2019s normally a little bit of a hockey stick anyway and back-end loaded but it looks even more so this year. Should we expect you to get fully caught up there?","John Morikis","You should expect us to continue to run in around 100 new stores rate, we try to press these deals earlier in the year. For some reason a lot of them end up at the tail-end of the previous year. But there is a really very good pipeline that good teams working on it, we\u2019re excited about our pipeline of new stores this year.","John Roberts","And then if the raw materials are down mid single for the year and down mid to high single in the back half of the year, one of the things that are down the most in that outlook. Is TiO2 something that is at the higher end, or are some things above the high end of that that might be down even double-digit?","Chris Connor","I think John from a timing standpoint we're seeing more relief on the petrochemical side of the basket early in the year. And to get to mid to upper single-digits by the end of year, we would need to see a slide in TiO2. So, I think that that would probably, on a percentage basis, perhaps put TiO2 to down more than the petrochemical than most to the petrochemical side of the basket. But right now, that is not the case.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you and good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering, we talked a lot about from selling price increases offsetting FX devaluation and so on. But as your raw material costs are coming down, do you anticipate some selling price pressure having to cut some of your pricing obviously outside of contracts?","Unidentified Company Representative","Not significantly or haven\u2019t impacted all I don\u2019t think really. The large jobs are always competitive we close those accordingly. The raw materials are one element of the products that we are -- one component of what goes into the selling price are services that we provide and the quality of the product, the people that we have with our customers all are a component of that. So, I think we\u2019re going to continue to see the pressure where we always have seen it, but nothing anymore than we have in the past.","Rosemarie Morbelli","All right, thanks. And then you also talked about the high level of expectations or satisfaction rather from contractors. Do you see any change in the do-it-yourself? Do you see that particular part of the equation growing still this year? Or do you think that people have more or less repainted what they were going to repaint for the last couple of years?","Unidentified Company Representative","Well we never think that Rosemarie, as soon as we\u2019re finished. But we continue to see, across the entire country, a shift towards the painting contractor away from the DIY just as a demographic that our country support, and aging population and less free time, et cetera. Having said that, the remaining portion of the market, which is around 40% of all the gallons of purchase price DIY, we would expect this to be a good year.","Bob has mentioned about residential repaint being one of the strongest segments, residential repaint is both DIY and pro and we\u2019ve seen nice growth there as well too. We have given color on our DIY sales gains inside the stores organization and the Consumer Group is mostly DIY. So, we would expect to see nice results for this year.","Rosemarie Morbelli","And the HGTV is also DIY, correct?","Unidentified Company Representative","That is correct and that will be an impact as well.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. And if I may, how long do you expect this housing recovery to continue based on your experience, based on historical data? Do you think it has another two years to go, another three years any thoughts? ","Bob Wells","Rosemarie -- this is Bob. We\u2019ve said kind of -- we didn\u2019t think for the last couple of years, that we really like the pace of this recovery that we\u2019re not seeing huge year-over-year increases in activity on either the residential or non-residential side of the market. And at this measured pace, depending on where the market peaks exactly, it could certainly go another three to five years.","We think that 1.3 million to 1.4 million residential starts is normal. But we\u2019ve been running below that normal rate for quite a while now for a number of years now. And so there should be some catch up required that would require us to go above the normalized rate at the peak of the recovery. So, we can be three to five years from the peak.","Rosemarie Morbelli","That is great. And if may ask for one last question for Sean, as you fix a lot of your short-term debt, you are obviously going to do it at a higher rate. Could we look at next year having interest expense increase by about 3%, is that more or less what we should be looking at?","Sean Hennessy","4.5% when you think about next year. And I would say that 4%-4.5% between 2016 and 2014, depending on the timing we felt we saved 4 million the first quarter. If we do a deal this quarter, you\u2019re not going to see that same savings. If it goes to the third quarter, you will see two quarters of it. So, that\u2019s why I think probably compared to 2014 is the right one way to look at for year.","Rosemarie Morbelli","And when you say -- so what you are saying so I am making sure I understand is that the rate will be about 4% to 4.5% above whatever you had in 2014, or is it that your interest expense will go up by that amount?","Sean Hennessy","The interest expense.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back to Mr. Wells for any final remarks.","Bob Wells","Thank you again, Melisa.

So let me turn the call over to John Morikis who will make some general comments and provide our outlook for fiscal year 2020. John?","John Morikis","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd like to make just a few additional comments on our fourth quarter and full year 2019 before moving on to our outlook for 2020. We ended the year on a strong note, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 21% compared to last year's fourth quarter.","In terms of the full year, we delivered another year of excellent results for our shareholders. Sales grew by 2.1% to a record $17.9 billion. Adjusted gross margin improved to 45.1%, reflecting our pricing efforts and moderation of raw material inflation. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 14% to a record $21.12 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased $235 million to a record $3.1 billion or 17.1% of sales.","Net operating cash increased $378 million to a record $2.32 billion or 13% of sales. Return on net assets employed increased to 15.1% on core profit before tax. Total shareholder return for the year was 49.7% and we returned approximately $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, an increase of 28% over the prior year. We reduced our debt by $660 million and we ended the year with net debt-to-EBITDA below three times.","Before moving on to my comments on our segments, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the integration of Valspar. While there's still much to be accomplished particularly outside the U.S., I wanted to thank our teams for their tremendous hard work to date in bringing our two businesses together and for increasing the value we are and will be able to deliver to our customers and to our shareholders.","Since the beginning of 2017, Sherwin-Williams has generated $6.1 billion in net operating cash or 12.2% of sales. We've used that cash to invest approximately $800 million back into the business, reduced debt by nearly $3 billion and returned approximately $2.5 billion to shareholders including $1.1 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in share buybacks.","We will no longer be calling out synergies related to the Valspar acquisition as it becomes more difficult to distinguish between acquisition synergies and our ongoing continuous improvements initiatives.","We exit 2019 having a benefit of about $315 million from synergies in the P&L including about $75 million that was realized in 2019. We've identified approximately another $100 million in opportunity, largely related to our supply chain optimization efforts in Europe and Asia. As previously communicated, we expect to realize a small portion of this benefit in 2020 with the majority being realized in 2021 and 2022 as projects are completed.","Let me now turn to just a few comments on our operating segments, all of which contributed to our record performance in 2019. Within the Americas Group, full year sales increased 5.7% against the prior year comparison of 5.6%. Residential Repaint remained our strongest customer segment, up by double-digit percentage year-over-year. This is the sixth year in a row we've grown Residential Repaint at a double-digit level.","All other segments grew in the mid-single-digit range for the year. Full year segment profit dollars and margin also improved year-over-year. We continue to invest in innovation and service introducing 27 new products, our ninth consecutive year of double-digit product introductions. We opened 94 new paint stores in the Americas Group this year and closed 32. To be clear, we opened 84 net new stores and added 150 new sales territories in the U.S. and Canada. Of the 32 stores we closed, 26 were in Latin America and were related to changing market dynamics.","In the Consumer segment, we generated growth with our largest retail partners in North America though full year segment sales decreased due to lower than expected sales in Asia and Australia and the impact of the Guardsman divestiture.","Adjusted segment margin improved to 17.5%, driven by synergies, operating efficiencies, pricing, moderating raw material costs and lower acquisition-related amortization expense.","Performance Coatings Group sales for the year were variable by geography and end market and were impacted by unfavorable currency translation rate changes. Growth in North America and Latin America was more than offset by softness in Europe and Asia. Mid single-digit growth in our packaging and coil lines was offset by softness in other product lines, most notably industrial wood. Adjusted segment margin increased to 14.1% from 12.9% in the prior year. Pricing, synergies and good cost control drove the improvement.","Turning to our 2020 outlook, we currently see a similar environment to last year with North America architectural demand remaining solid and industrial demand remaining variable by geography and end market. We have many opportunities to grow share in all of our businesses and I remain highly confident in our ability to provide customers with solutions, based on innovation, value-added service and differentiated distribution. We enter 2020 well positioned and focused on what we can control.","For the first quarter of 2020, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by 2% to 5% compared to the first quarter of 2019. We expect the Americas Group to be at or above the high end of that range. We expect Consumer Brands to be flat or slightly up excluding the impact of the Ace business, we exited in 2019 and we expect Performance Coatings to be up by low single digits.","For the full year 2020, we expect net sales to increase by 2% to 4%, with segment performance similar to what I described for the first quarter. On an earnings per share basis, we believe the most meaningful way to provide guidance is to exclude Valspar acquisition costs and onetime items. On this basis and given our sales outlook, we expect adjusted 2020 full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $22.70 to $23.50 per share, an increase of approximately 9.4% at the midpoint compared to the $21.12 reported in 2019 on a comparable basis.","This adjusted 2020 guidance excludes approximately $2.79 per share for acquisition-related expense. The Regulation G reconciliation table in our press release illustrates these moving parts. We expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. One key assumption embedded in our outlook is that the market rate of inflation for our raw materials basket in 2020 will be flat compared to 2019, assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and no supply disruptions. We expect the basket to be lower year-over-year in the first quarter and to a lesser extent in the second quarter with year-over-year costs, flattening out or slightly increasing in the back half of the year.","A few additional data points may be helpful for modeling purposes. We'll continue to make investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. These investments include new stores and reps, capacity and productivity improvements, systems and product innovation in both our architectural and industrial businesses. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform and the home center channel.","These investments are embedded in our full year guidance. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $320 million, which is about 1.7% of anticipated sales. Note that this estimate does not include any expenditure related to our previously announced headquarters and R&D center project. We expect to provide you with an update on this project in the near future.","Depreciation should be $275 million and amortization will be about $310 million. Historically, we have targeted dividends of about 30% of prior year GAAP earnings. Next month, at our Board of Directors' meetings, we'll recommend a quarterly dividend increase of 18.6% to $1.34 per share, up from $1.13 last year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy.","Before moving on to your questions, let me wrap up today by asking you to save the date of Wednesday, June 3 on your calendars. That will be the day we'll host our annual financial community presentation at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York. The program will include presentations by several members of our leadership team. We'll host our customary Q&A session followed by a reception and lunch. Again, that date is Wednesday, June 3rd. We'll be sending out invitations and related information and a link to our registration site in April.","With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you. Can you just talk a little bit more about your expectations for U.S. housing and the consequence of architectural volumes outlook just given some more constructive data? Just in terms of what you're hearing from the Americas Group heads and their customers, do you expect broader volume participation this year? Or just what are the key puts and takes? Thank you.","Jim Jaye","Sure, Chris. Good morning. It's Jim. What we always talk about when we have this question is we look at our sentiment from our 4,500 store managers and our 3,000 sales reps and they continue to be very optimistic about what they're seeing as we end the year and as we head into 2020. As we've talked about this in the past from a big picture perspective, certainly we believe that the continuing household formations in that 1.3 million range annually will support what's going on as we go forward. But as you point out Chris, the more recent data is encouraging. We're seeing strengthening in single and multifamily permits starts and completions at the year-end.","And really the three-month trailing average for all of those was up double-digits. We were at the builder show that just happened. And I would tell you optimism at that builder show among our customers was very positive. And you have other things out there that are supportive as well. The mortgage rate remains very reasonable and some of the recent reports by some of the national homebuilders are also talking about strong orders. So I think we feel very good about where housing is headed from a macro perspective.","Al Mistysyn","Hey, Chris, this is Al. I'd just like to add on to that comment by saying as you look at how our North America paint stores group unfolded throughout the year, our second half was stronger than our first half. And even as you look at what TAG performed we're at 4.8% you look at our same-store sales up 4.6%. To put that in perspective, architectural gallons were high single-digits in the quarter because as you -- as a reminder, we did not go out with price in our fourth quarter. And historically, as we've seen momentum in our second half and in our fourth quarter that translates to growth in our first half. So that's what makes us feel pretty good about the paint stores in architectural in North America.","Christopher Parkinson","Great. And just a quick follow-up. You previously discussed potentially getting your margins in consumer performance back up to -- towards let's say 20% was targeted. But can you just simply update us on your conviction and your ability to do this? And just also highlight to the investment community any key non-raw material levers you can continue to pull to potentially make this happen in each segment? Thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Chris. We're not coming off our numbers. I am confident in our ability to hit those financial targets we laid out for 2020. As I talked about on the June Investor Day, I confirm that we'll hit those targets but on a lag. And I think throughout 2019, we made significant progress and are on the right path to attaining those goals. And we've even attained some of those goals already. If you look at our core gross margin at 45.1% for the year, it's at the low-end of the targeted range that I had laid out at 45% to 48%.","And you look at our strong net operating cash. And if I looked at net operating cash at 13% less CapEx, you get a little over 11% net operating cash less CapEx which is the target that we have laid out. So I am very confident in our ability on Performance Coatings and Consumer Brands to expand their margins to that mid- to high-teens low-20s and they made good progress this year.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Byrne","Hey. Al, you just mentioned that the same-store sales metric in the fourth quarter was mostly volume in TAG just because you lapped the year-ago price. And Jim you mentioned the strongest region was the southeast where in October they were really underwater in that region. So can you just comment on where you think backlog is in architectural paint contractors? And where do you think this could drive same-store sales in 2020?","John Morikis","Well, Steve I think we're feeling really good about the market and the feedback that we're getting from our customers. As you've just mentioned there is a backlog. Part of it I think has to do with labor. We continue to believe that backlog if you will in labor supports our model and helps build loyalty to what it is that we're trying to do for our customers which is driving the technology and services that help them to be more successful.","And we've got a lot of new products that we're launching going into this year a lot of services that we're introducing all directly pointed at trying to help those customers to attack those. So to your question we think geographically it's pretty solid. There's no pockets that I've been in yet or -- nor that we've heard from our teams where people are feeling softness. There's a general consensus that contractors are feeling very good could do more if they had more labor. And we want to be there to help support them accomplish their goals.","Stephen Byrne","And John did you anticipate that changing some of the acquired brands to the Sherwin brand would impact the outlook for sales for those products?","John Morikis","Yes. I'd like Al to talk to it from a financial perspective but absolutely. In fact I would say we're feeling really good about the fact that we've gotten here as fast as we have. As we entered into the integration, we're always listening to our customers and always listening to our employees and the fact that our customers the retention of both our customers and our employees is so high in allowing us to move aggressively in this brand consolidation gives us really a great sense of pride of the speed and execution that we're moving in.","Al Mistysyn","Yes and Steve, I would just add this is not indicative of the underlying businesses. If you look at healthy businesses operating margins are expanding and we saw that in Consumer Brands and in our Performance Coatings Groups this year. And as John talked about in his opening remarks I mean we generated strong cash flow over the period end of 2017 through 2019. And we'll continue to do that. We saw strong cash flow in 2019. So as a reminder we looked at this Valspar acquisition over the long term. It's hard when you're going into an acquisition to predict timing of when certain events happen. But as John said improving our operating efficiencies by consolidating brands that's only going to help us going forward.","Stephen Byrne","Thank you. ","John Morikis","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Can you talk about business conditions in China and in Europe? And maybe your offshore operations generally in 2019 how much did they grow in revenue terms? Or how much did they shrink? And whether business conditions in China in the first quarter of 2020 are very different than what they were in the fourth quarter of 2019?","John Morikis","Right. Well I think specifically to China, I'd say that the environment that we find ourselves in some of our business has been a challenge. If you look at our industrial wood for example with the tariffs and generally a weaker economy it's had an impact on our business. We've had pockets of strength in Southeast Asia particularly in the cabinets area wood. So I'd say from a wood perspective it's been the most challenging.","That said, if you look at our packaging business as an example we had a terrific run there in Asia actually across the globe in packaging. Our coil business in Asia was positive. We had some pressure in our general industrial business there. Our automotive business is pretty small Jeff in Asia, but it was positive. So I'd say a mixed bag there. Clearly some pressure, but our market share there is such that it gives us terrific opportunity for growth and that's where we're headed.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And then just a small question. You talked about most of the growth in the stores business in the fourth quarter coming from volume. But in previous quarters, it seemed that price was a larger element. Did you simply annualize your price increases or was there some competitive activity that led to a lower price benefit? Or was there a mix effect? Why was price a smaller component in the fourth quarter?","John Morikis","Yes. There was virtually no price in the quarter and it was because last year 2018, the price increase went in the 1st of October Jeff. In this year, we rolled it in January 1. So, the fourth quarter was exposed from a pricings perspective.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","John Morikis","And I'd just point out as Al mentioned, so when we look at the architectural gallons in that fourth quarter up the high single-digits, it was a really good quarter for our team in our TAG business.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hey guys. Good morning.","John Morikis","Good morning.","Ghansham Panjabi","Can you help us with the margins on the Americas Group segment? Did that play out the way you thought it would during the fourth quarter? During the third quarter, you had a nice year-over-year acceleration in margins. I think it was up 120 basis points, 4Q was closer to 70 basis points and that was also in a very healthy increase in sales. What were the offsets there?","Al Mistysyn","Yes. So Ghansham the way I look at -- I start with the flow-through. When you look at flow through in TAG in the fourth quarter and it was over 33%, so we saw nice leverage on our gallon increased.","As John talked about in his opening remarks about investments and additional opportunities and we have taken a long-term strategic view of the market. And aside from just new stores and new reps that we talked about John talked about expanding our digital platform that I think -- and we believe will give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. And we're expanding and investing in that tool to get better aligned with our customer to offer better services to make them more efficient.","Ultimately, as we've talked about we want to drive higher topline growth for them and profitability. So, we started that really coming in third quarter and fourth quarter and you'll see us continue investing at the next year.","John Morikis","Yes. Ghansham I think when we were together actually we talked a little bit about some of the investments we were making on that digital. And we're really proud to be announcing that we'll be rolling this out nationally at the end of the first quarter. We think this is the start of a -- we have a number of products in the pipeline here, but the start of a process that we've been really investing in. And to Al's point we're cranking that up.","And the idea here is increasing that loyalty and the contractors leaning on us to be more efficient in what it is that they're trying to do. We talked early about labor. And this -- the launch of this digital platform will help them run a more efficient business.","It's not just external though. We're also investing internally. We didn't talk about this last year. We've made it through one year now with our sales reps now having had iPads for one year. We think that's improving the productivity of our sales organization to be more responsive to our customers. This year we've just announced to our team we're rolling out iPads into our stores to make them more productive and more efficient and more responsive to the needs of our customers.","So, we are investing. We're investing in this business. We have great confidence of our position right now. And quite frankly, we see some competitive opportunities that we want to take advantage of. So, we're putting our foot on the gas here.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. Thanks for clarifying. And then just for my second question on the Performance Coatings segment. Even with the industrial markets having been weaker for everybody including you, the margins were still up year-over-year. Was there any residual price catch up or any significant mix benefit from businesses like packaging that drove the margin expansion apart from just synergy flow through?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Ghansham that's a very astute point. As packaging and coil sales have expanded faster than the rest of the businesses, we did see some lift in the margin on that. Yes, as we've talked about in the past, our industrial business took the brunt of the run-up in raw materials in 2017 and 2018. We've been chasing that for the last few years. It doesn't come in uniformly like our paint stores group. So, yeah we saw some pricing flow through in our fourth quarter.","And then the other thing I would say is, as we are investing in growth opportunities we are also laser-focused on controlling and managing our costs where our businesses and\/or regions aren't performing to where you expect them to perform or seeing a path to a set target. So, we're controlling our costs and consolidating operations as well. So you can expect that to continue as we go forward as we continue to invest in other areas.","Ghansham Panjabi","Got it. Thanks so much.","Al Mistysyn","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thank you, Ghan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John McNulty","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to -- in the release you had laid out some acquisition-related costs still in 2020 kind of to the tune of what looks to be $300 million to $350 million or so. I guess what is that still being spent on? And I guess how much of it is -- how much should we be thinking about as actually a cash hit? And then I guess tied to that how are you thinking about cash conversion as we look to 2020, because it obviously took a big step-up in 2019, but curious how or where we go from here.","Al Mistysyn","Yes John. I'm glad you brought that up, because it's important that for an apples-to-apples comparison we wanted to call out acquisition-related costs. And the amortization depreciation year-over-year is very similar, embedded in that number is about $30 million in additional integration costs. And we wanted to include that in our guidance in the Reg G table, but we're not going to be laying that out going forward.","That breaks out just so for modeling purposes a little more back half versus front half loaded. But this gets us in the next phase. Like John talked about synergies is part of our continuous improvement process. We're going to get back to integration activities it's just part of our normal operating process.","As far as cash flow, John you've followed us for a very long time. 13%, that's always the new high watermark. And as I talked about in our Investor Day and earlier, net operating cash less CapEx we're targeting 11% and we expect to continue to hit that target as we go forward.","John McNulty","Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. With regard to the pipeline that you're seeing from your customers, it sounds like the residential side is pretty solid. Can you speak to the non-resi side and what you're seeing there?","John Morikis","Yeah, it's very good. If you look at the commercial side property management, I'd say John, trying not to get ahead of myself here but we're feeling really good. I was just -- came back from our national sales meeting. We had 8,500 of our closest friends together talking about just that, and very bullish environment very positive. And if you go from the commercial to property management into health care, I mean there's a general feeling that our customers are really excited about what's ahead for 2020. So, we're really looking forward to this year.","John McNulty","Great. Thanks very much for the color.","Al Mistysyn","Yeah.","John Morikis","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan","Good morning. Just curious on the paint store side, was there any change in the quarter? I know that you put up an 8 comp in Q3 and that would imply like a 6 volume and you did a 5.3 here. So it doesn't appear that way. I'm just curious if you noticed an improvement in Q4 or a deceleration. And do you expect kind of similar kind of mid- single-digit volume growth in 2020? Thanks.","John Morikis","Yeah, Arun, I'd say the largest impact that we had was our Protective & Marine business that runs through our TAG business. The Architectural business as we mentioned was up high-single-digits. We talked about the fact that we've had another double-digit increase in Residential Repaint, and just talked about some of the other segments and the confidence that we have there. If you look at those indicators that we often cite spray equipment, non-paint items, everything points in the right direction.","So, high-single-digit architectural gallons going through impacted by the P&M business. And the P&M business through our stores was largely impacted by oil and gas which was under pressure. And we had some timing of some big projects likely not going to be starting out until the beginning of the second quarter. So we saw a little bit of softness in P&M in the fourth quarter, probably going to see a little bit in the first quarter. But again the pipeline that we're looking at here is really solid.","Al Mistysyn","Yes. And Arun I would just add to that. The price increase that we went out with in our North America stores on January 1 was 3% to 4%. We expect an effective rate of just below 2%. And as John laid out in the opening remarks we expect paints \u2013 our TAG organization to be at the high end of our 2% to 4%. So you think 4% to 6%. If there's less than 2% in price the rest is volume.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. That's very helpful. Thanks for that. And then just as a quick follow-up on PCG, obviously there's macro pressures and regional variability as you said. Do you think that is kind of tilted to the downside just given the coronavirus? Or maybe you can just offer your thoughts on where we are potentially destocking wise or \u2013 especially in Europe and Asia is there any potential for stability there as we move through 2020? Thanks.","John Morikis","Yes I think we look at the comparisons of 2019 to 2020 and we have higher expectations moving forward. It might be helpful. Or maybe I could just talk about each of the segments just briefly. If we look at our auto and maybe I'll just do it for a number of the regions rather than just the two because I'm sure there's some more questions there.","On auto we'd say, North America we feel really good. Probably the best I felt in the time I've been CEO or COO. Collision shop business here is very strong. I think we're in a really strong position and we're going to take advantage of that going forward.","Europe, I'd say we had a little bit of softness in our auto business in Europe. Asia, as I mentioned earlier, it's a small business up, mid-single digits. In Latin America, we have a leadership position. It was impacted primarily by currency. We had a good quarter in auto in Latin America.","Packaging, clearly the non-BPA is giving us a terrific opportunity. We believe that's an ongoing transition with plenty of opportunity for us ahead. And so we're investing in this business. We're investing in technology and in capacity and really trying to stay aligned with our customers.","We've got great partners that we're trying to support. And if you look at this \u2013 this was a double-digit quarter for them. North America was strong double-digits. To your question about Europe and Asia, Europe was up but Asia was up really, really strong double-digits.","And there our business in packaging is growing both in beverage and in food. In coil, new business wins really across the region, North America throughout everyone. We did have a little bit of softness in comparison in Europe. But this is a team that's really hitting on all cylinders and we're working hard. So those are the ones that are really performing quite well.","GI, Asia we felt some impact there in our general industrial, largely in the heavy equipment and ag equipment. But we have a good pipeline of projects and good \u2013 really good people there. We expect to really see some improvement in our performance in this business.","Industrial wood I talked about earlier. China a lot of pressure. Feeling good about Southeast Asia. Europe was another area of pressure as well. So amongst all the businesses I would say, the one we're feeling the most pressure in would be the industrial wood.","And then Protective & Marine, I talked about largely running through our North American business through our TAG. But if I look at our smaller businesses albeit Asia is a very small business, it was up strong double-digits for us. Europe, down slightly as we had some pressure and some comparisons to some business there. Latin America was up slightly as well. So that kind of captures all the regions all the businesses, Arun. Hopefully, satisfied some other questions with that response.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Great, thanks. Thanks, Al.","Al Mistysyn","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good morning. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit further on capital deployment. You've made some nice progress again on the balance sheet. John just wondering if you would foresee any material change in the balance of acquisition activity versus repurchases as you look ahead into 2020?","John Morikis","I think, the M&A, activity is something that we're really focused on. We think it's an important part of our future, although, we don't feel as though we have a gun to our head. We've got -- the challenge for us right now, quite frankly, internally is prioritization of the opportunities.","So, we're very active. And I would say to answer your question you should see us deploying more cash into M&A. I don't think you're going to see the transformational type of acquisition that Valspar was.","But we're working business-by-business, to understand region-by-region, where it is there are opportunities. I want to clearly point out that we are not trying to be everything to everyone everywhere. We are absolutely determined to invest where we can return -- generate a return of share for our shareholders.","And each of our businesses are developed a really good strategy that they're executing. And any of those M&A, opportunities include the right to win in those markets. So we're not going to be there. We're not deploying cash in commodity areas. And we're not deploying cash for the sake of saying that we can be somewhere. We're there to make money.","Kevin McCarthy","Understood, that's helpful. My second question relates to raw materials. It sounds like you anticipate some relief to start the year, just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color as to the individual categories like, pigment and petrochemicals et cetera.","And then with regard to resins in particular, just wondering if you could comment on, your degree of internal integration versus external, purchases of resins and how that's evolved in recent years if it has. Thank you.","Jim Jaye","Sure. Sure, Kevin. Glad to answer that. As John said in his comments and you're right, our outlook for this year is that the overall basket will be flat compared to 2019. And that's assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks, no supply disruptions.","It will be lower year-over-year in the first quarter. It will be a lesser extent in the second quarter. And then, sort of flatten out and maybe increase in the back half. If you remember, we had our highest rate of inflation in 2019 it was in the first quarter, which moderated through the year.","So, our full year outlook that's our best estimate at this time, the visibility once you get a couple of quarters out is a little bit murkier. When you get to the specific categories Kevin, we expect the petrochemical basket to be in line with our overall raw material outlook, probably a tailwind in the first quarter, maybe into the second quarter, before flattening and again increasing in the back half.","We're seeing right now key feedstocks propylene, ethylene are down, year-over-year as we enter 2020. And other key materials like epoxy for example, more on our industrial side are also down year-over-year.","From a TiO2 perspective, right now what we're seeing is relatively stable, moving into 2020, based on the current demand environment that we're in. So, that's kind of a big picture look at it from a resin internalization standpoint. I'll let Al take that one.","Al Mistysyn","Yeah. Kevin, I don't think our strategy has changed. We've picked up a nice business with EPS, as part of the Valspar acquisition. We've got to even invest in more assets to internalize resins, but it's a balance.","We look at where we can make the most from a -- not just -- not a cost necessarily but from a differentiation standpoint. And we have as we've talked about a number of projects in the pipeline across each of the segments to continue to drive, what I'd call continuous improvement opportunities.","You saw some of that benefit in our Consumer Brands group this year. And helping their margin expansion and you should expect that going forward.","John Morikis","Yeah Kevin, if I could, I'd just like to add just one other component, that was just slightly touched on by Al on the proprietary development of technology. We're looking at this opportunity to serve our customers, particularly the painting contractor who's looking to maximize productivity.","And we're combining the asset that you're asking about in a way I think that's really unique for Sherwin. We're trying to position ourselves to provide solutions and technology to help those customers to be more productive.","I mentioned earlier, the number of products that we are introducing. And here, I'd just like to take the opportunity to talk about three of those. Because I think it highlights what Al just talked about from a resin capability standpoint. And I'll be very brief on this. But this gives us the opportunity to develop products that really help our customers in a unique way. We're introducing a product this year called Flex Temp that provides a contractor the ability to get out earlier colder temperatures and stay out longer in hotter temperatures. It actually has a spread of ability to be applied from 35 degrees Fahrenheit up to 120 degrees Fahrenheit with no change in viscosity, terrific uniform application. And so it extends the ability of these painting contractors to be out.","So when we talk about labor and the challenges of getting caught up, we're looking at ways to make them more productive. We're introducing a new product called Emerald Rain Refresh that again same platform of technology proprietary. We'll hold on to this. No one else will have it. But this is a product that not only optimizes applications so that you have more productivity from painters with less experience. This is a product that when it rains or it is hosed down, it looks like it was just painted. So after every rain the home or commercial building to look as if it was just painted brand new clean. So these painters that have applied this in the commercialization process have just been really raving about it.","And the last one just to be brief again, we're introducing a new extension on our Emerald line, which is our top of the line product. This will be the finest paint that we've produced yet, outstanding hiding, great applications. So again painters with limited experience. We're making limited experienced painters better painters. Best application, better touch up, all with this idea that if we're developing resins and products for them, the loyalty to Sherwin increases.","Kevin McCarthy","Thank you so much.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Walker","Hi guys. This is Anthony Walker on for Bob. Maybe just two quick ones. Can you talk about the performance of the international businesses within the consumer segment, which you acquired through the Valspar transaction? In the past you've talked about potential strategic or rationalization opportunities there assuming the businesses continued to underperform. How should we think about the timing and the opportunity there?","John Morikis","Yeah. I think -- let me just walk through the three areas there just briefly. First, Asia, I'd say the business is certainly going through a transition. We've talked about the fact that this Ballroom [ph] brand was predominantly focused on interior wood. So we're shifting that strategy as much of that business internally and region is now shifting to a shop or factory applied application.","And so the teams are developing a strategy and executing pieces of it to pursue and reposition the brand there. Again a small piece of the business, but we think this is an important one. Future opportunity here is terrific. We're gaining -- we're making some progress in the quarter. We started to see a positive trend in Asia. So I'd say that one is trending the right way.","Europe we made significant progress this past year. Sales were positive in mid-single digits. Operating profit improved to a low double-digit percentage, so feeling that we are pointing in the right direction there.","Australia is a bird of another color. We've got some challenges there. And quite frankly we're not performing as needed. We have plans and teams executing on this. This is one that you should expect us to get closer to and see some improvement or making some tough changes.","Anthony Walker","Great. Thanks. And then just one on the price increase that you announced for the Paint Stores Group. How should we think about that flowing through the results in the year? Will we start to see that show up in the first quarter in full? And then how should we also think about the magnitude of what I assume are labor freight and distribution expenses as sort of tempting to offset? Thanks.","Al Mistysyn","Yeah. The pricing will roll out on a similar cadence to past price increases. You'll see some of that for sure in the first quarter. And then as it takes hold over the next six months, we'll get full effectiveness as it flows through all of our customers. When you look at our cost basket that we've talked about, merit increases are higher than what they've been in the past, health care benefits continue to rise and as we've absorbed those over the past number of years. But this price increase is not unprecedented to cover costs other than raw materials. And if you go back in the first quarter of 2014, we went out a price increase to cover those costs, because as you can imagine it's a compounding. If you don't get it in the first year and it compounds over three or four years, it gets to be pretty steep. So that's kind of why this justification with this price increase.","John Morikis","Yeah. We're not getting thank you notes from our customers obviously, but many of them are facing similar situations. So the fact that we waited until January 1 gave our customers an opportunity to kind of recalibrate as they're bidding going forward in the New Year. And secondly the fact that they're experiencing the same thing I think has helped in the execution as well. Hello.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move on to our next question, which comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Harrison","Hi. Good afternoon.","John Morikis","Hey, Mike.","Mike Harrison","Wondering if you could give us an update on the progress at Lowe's. And maybe just more broadly speaking your expectations for DIY in the first half of 2019. It seems like with refinancing activity having picked up and the easy weather comps and the store resets and the training that's been going on at Lowe's that maybe that business could be stronger yet you guys provided guidance that suggests that consumer is more flattish for the full year.","John Morikis","Yeah. So, a piece of that just a reminder as we have the ACE business that's coming out. So that's a piece of the go-forward forecast, Mike. But I would describe our opportunity at Lowe's quite simply as we think we're moving the ball in the right direction, but we're never satisfied.","And we're investing. I mentioned earlier in my remarks about that we're stepping up our investments in the home center channel. Obviously, they would be a big part of that. We see that there are opportunities in both the consumer side and the professional side those pros that paint, we think it's a terrific opportunity for us to help our customer.","On the consumer side, we have a lot of opportunities to help convert shoppers into customers. And we made a big commitment to this relationship and we want to see this thing through. And the opportunity here is to help execute and that's on all fronts.","So I don't think you should ever expect us to say that we're done. This is a business that we're looking at just aggressively as we do our own stores business. We think there's opportunities, and we're committed to helping our customer win.","Al Mistysyn","Hey, Mike, I would just add to that that, we have talked about this in the past that embedded in our Consumer Brands segment is our retail channel that has been under pressure consistently. And as Lowe's has performed better, they certainly are taking share from that segment.","And then we're trying to be realistic. When we look outside the U.S., we're trying not to build -- although optimistic trying not to build a hockey stick to our sales guidance. And -- but rest assured we expect more out of those teams outside the U.S.","Mike Harrison","All right. And then I wanted to also ask about the ColorSnap consultation brand and how that's contributing to paint store sales growth. How much of North America do you have covered with the ColorSnap offering at this point? I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of what stage we're in with that rollout and how much more it could contribute? Thanks.","John Morikis","Yeah, we're pretty early in it. There was an opportunity. And again, this goes back to helping our customers. Mike, you really hit on something here, because this has worked out quite well for us not so much just for the consumer, but our residential repaint contractors are leaning on us to help accelerate the selling process for them.","And as we employ this as well as the digital ColorSnap, which is an AI application that's new and continuing to -- we continue to enhance the previous platform, it allows our customers to accelerate through their process of closing business. This is the professional painting contractor to a homeowner.","So I would suspect that you're going to see that as a component one of many items that we are going to continue to leverage and add service and productivity that helps build loyalty to the painting contractor. But it's still got a lot of opportunity across the country. A lot.","Mike Harrison","All right.","John Morikis","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","We'll move on to our next question which comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter","Thank you, good morning. John can you discuss your plans for store openings and any closings in 2020? And any impact on the cadence of store openings from either your digital strategy or how you're trying to service some of your larger customers going forward?","John Morikis","Well we expect to continue in that range of 80 to 100 stores. We -- I don't know that it's changed in any way from a store cadence. We'd like to see a smoother rollout of the stores rolling in. I've been trying to fix that since I ran that business 15 years ago. But I'd say that we feel really good about it.","I also want to thank our teams because I think we're getting -- continuing to get better at it. The stores that we're opening and we're cranking up faster and the impact is better. Some of that has to do with the quality of people in the stores as well as the systems that we're adding to those. So I'd say you should expect us to continue to add in those stores at a similar rate to what we've had.","Al Mistysyn","Yes. David, I'd just add. When you look at TAG and we closed 32 stores in the year 26 of those stores were in Latin America. We have talked about the pressure we've been under Latin America.","As you know we take a rigorous and consistent view of our portfolio of businesses brands customer programs and other investments. And as we've not been able to see a line of sight to above average growth either in sales, operating margins, cash we've had to take action.","We're not exiting those markets but pushing those sales through what I would call more of a dealer network which is a little less asset intensive. And I think you'll see some of that continue here in our first half.","David Begleiter","Very good. And John just lastly what's your sense on the pool of available painters in both the quantity as well as the quality in 2020?","John Morikis","Let's say, it's under pressure. Our customers as I mentioned earlier would like to move faster and there are a number of wonderful painters and many people entering in the industry that are learning as they go.","And as I mentioned as I ran through those products briefly, we're taking that into consideration as we're building products and helping our customers to improve their efficiency. So I'd say they're both under pressure. People that typically enter into the trades, we're working with those professionals to help train those employees, but there's a pressure in finding them.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","P.J. Juvekar","Hi, good morning. Good afternoon.","John Morikis","Hey P.J.","P.J. Juvekar","Plastic single-use plastics are coming under pressure. So it's bags and bottles. I was wondering if as bottles come under pressure would some of the food and beverage stuff move to cans? And would that become an opportunity for you on interior or exterior coatings of the cans?","John Morikis","Yes. The answer is yes. We would welcome that transition and we want to work to support our customers to do that. As I mentioned earlier the progress that we're making in our packaging business in both food and beverage has been fantastic and more of that transitioning into our packaging and customers' business is terrific.","And that's why we talk a lot about this in our stores business. But even on the packaging side, we're really determined to help our customers through technology to help speed up lines to help minimize -- not damaged, but trying to buy imperfections in the coatings.","But the idea here is as we help them become more efficient in driving efficiencies into their plant, the better supplier we are. So we're really focused on making them better.","P.J. Juvekar","Okay. And then my second question is, now that your leverage is below your target of three times, what is your willingness to look at M&A, what size? And would 2020 be the year that you come back into the market for M&A?","Al Mistysyn","P.J. we have consistently are looking for acquisitions of any size. I mean, I think you're right, as you look at our debt-to-EBITDA ratio under three in 2020, I don't expect to pay down debt. And as our EBITDA grows, you'll see us drive that target down towards the 2 to 2.5 long-term target that I have. But yes, we are actively looking for acquisitions. But as John mentioned earlier, we're taking a disciplined approach to that. And I'd say we raised the dividend 18%. We'll keep CapEx below 2%. But absent those M&A absent any acquisitions, we're going to buy back our stock this year.","John Morikis","Yes. But I think to your point though our COO David Sewell got his teams really leaning forward in this area looking for those opportunities, not only just simply from the opportunity, but from the strategic value that can be gained from it.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Thank you, P.J.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you. All I've got left on my list is Al can you just -- the tax rate stepping up this year, is that just sort of your starting point? And then you see how the year plays out and what things your team comes up with. Or do you -- how should we be thinking about the higher tax rate?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Vincent. That -- I'm always looking at the tax rate. It's a function of how many options and how our legal entity consolidations flow through to help that tax rate. So I started at the low 20% range and then I expect our tax guys to develop plans and continue with the programs that are going to continue to drive that down.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks very much.","Al Mistysyn","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Duffy Fischer","Yeah, good morning. Just one for me. Volumetrically how fast did the North American architectural market grow last year do you guys think?","Jim Jaye","We haven't seen official data yet on that Duffy. If I go back to probably the most recent data we have is 2018 gallon growth was a little over 2%. I want to say, it's probably similar in 2019 and probably at a similar level in 2020 sort of that low single-digit level if I would guess.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thanks guys.","Jim Jaye","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Speer","Perfect guys. I just wanted to unpack that if you could help maybe further unpack the nature of those SG&A investments. And how you think they'll unfold from a percentage of revenue standpoint?","Al Mistysyn","Yes. Justin, we're not going to go down the P&L by line on the guidance. I think what we've consistently done is grow our store count, grow our rep count and then these additional investments are going to come through pretty evenly throughout the year. And we're not going to quantify them because it's like any other review that we do. We want to see how the first half unfolds, how volumes look and it may give us an opportunity to accelerate in the back half of the year like we did this year. So I think it depends, but they're in our guidance and we'll continue to manage those accordingly.","John Morikis","I would say Justin, we are planning on sharing a number of these with you during our financial community presentation on that June 3rd date where we'll give you some idea from -- in some of these areas the digital I think you'll be really impressed with. And to the extent that we're comfortable in sharing, obviously we don't want to point specifically for competitive reasons to what we're doing. But as much as we can as things roll out, we'll share what we've done, but not what we're going to do.","Justin Speer","Okay. And I guess maybe because I'm sure you pilot, I know you piloted a number of these different programs. But just curious how the -- there's like a response rate in terms of growth improvement to the model. Or is it just a stickiness in this widening of the moat, bringing the customer closer, the relationship is good? But does it change the growth algorithm or the amount of gallons that flow through, all else equal?","John Morikis","Yes, we're doing this for growth. We absolutely believe it improves the stickiness, the moat -- any metaphor we want to use, but we are growing our business and we're going to do it profitably. And we think that the more solutions that we bring to our customers to help make them more profitable, the more likely we're going to continue to be their supplier. And so, we're really focused on not just one lever, one silver bullet, but a number of these that will enhance their ability to be successful. And as a result, we become a better supplier to them.","Justin Speer","Thanks. And my last question is just on the consumer business. Just, how much mix benefit from that transition in Ace will you -- are you thinking or estimating for your 2020 targets there?","Al Mistysyn","Yes. What we talked about is the Ace business, that private label business, was about $100 million a year, considerably below the average of our consumer operating margin. We didn't lay that out and we're not going to, but you should expect margin improvement because of that.","Justin Speer","Thank you, gentlemen.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks, Justin. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question. Garik, your line is live, you may proceed with your question. We'll move on to our next question, which comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Truman Patterson","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just wanted to make sure I'm understanding this clearly on your TAG and paint stores demand outlook for 2020. The full year guide, I think, it implies that volumes grow pretty much in line with 2019, maybe at a bit of a slower pace even.","When I'm listening to you all, you're very optimistic on the architectural volume side. Seems like that market is even accelerating, which would imply that Protective & Marine in that non-res market might even be decelerating versus 2019. Just trying to understand how you all are thinking about that. And if you can walk me through the parts.","John Morikis","Yes, Truman, I'd say, you're right in sensing our confidence in the architectural side, having just finished the quarter in the mid single -- or I'm sorry, high single digits, gives us confidence moving forward. On the Protective & Marine side that runs through there, we've got the fourth quarter and likely the first quarter right now that we're seeing is likely a little softer than we would have liked to seeing, but feeling pretty good about it going forward. So, I think, we're trying to be just in line with what our customers are telling us and we feel pretty good about the number that we put out here.","Al Mistysyn","Yes. Truman, the other comment I would make is, as I mentioned earlier, if you look at the way the year unfolded for paint stores in North America. We had a strong second half versus the first half, even a 9%, 8%, 7% TAG increase in the third quarter, which is a large quarter and a very good result in a large quarter like that. So, I think, when we get through our second quarter and see how the year is unfolding, we can give you an update then.","Truman Patterson","Okay, okay. And then, final question for me, just on the raw materials basket. Can you just discuss what kind of tailwinds you actually saw in the fourth quarter from an overall basket perspective? And then, just remind us what you ended up seeing in 2019 as a whole.","Jim Jaye","Yes, Truman. Costs for the broad basket that we buy, I would say, moderated slightly in the fourth quarter 2019 from third quarter of 2019. So it kind of played out as we thought. Fourth quarter 2019 was also lower year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by lower cost for resins solvents. And we don't provide specific dollars on the savings of the raw materials, but you can see the positive trend, I think, reflected in our year-over-year gross margin improvement.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Thank you.","Jim Jaye","Sure.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with G.Research. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.","John Morikis","Hi.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. John, I was wondering if you could give us a little more on the impairment charges. I am assuming that the bulk of it is the woods coatings in China, but you also mentioned one impairment taken in the Consumer Brands category. Is that ACE? Or a little color on which product lines you are more or less eliminating as there is no growth and those for which you are going to change the brand name.","John Morikis","Yes, Rosemary. I would not classify it as no growth. I would characterize it in GI and in automotive. As we've put in implemented our systems, our legacy systems, we've gotten customers to move to a new label and that has helped us optimize or streamline our operations. That's the biggest impact. Another example would be in Australia. We're under pressure that we talked about earlier about driving operating margin and cash flow improvement. And one way to do that is, reduce the number of brands you're trying to support. And so, in that area, we also move from -- remove focus if you will on one brand and driving it more through the Wattyl brand.","And again that's going to help us in the midterm here to reduce our costs and keep investing in labels and merchandising and different things like that. So, the Walroom brand in China has been under pressure. John talked about that transition certainly from -- to factory applied coatings. That is an impact. And as that transition continues to move and expand, we're not expecting or anticipating any other impairments going forward.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. And then the goal was very optimistic. Your projections of 2% to 4% on the revenue line is stronger or higher than it was 2019 versus 2018. And yet if I look at your EPS projections at the midpoint it is up 9% versus up 14% in 2019 over '14 if I have those numbers right. So, I am wondering what are the offsets?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Rosemarie. I'd say that we're -- if you're comparing last year to the go forward as I talked about the price increase that we went out with and being effective under 2% that's below what we really realized through the first three quarters of last year. Our raw material moderation isn't as strong as what we saw in 2019. And these investments that we talked about even though we're seeing slower in our second half of 2019 on Performance Coatings, we continue to invest back in this -- in our businesses that we think are going to provide growth opportunities in the future, not only the new stores and the new reps that we even accelerated in the back half but this digital program that John laid out. And then, some other -- our home center channel that -- so yes, we're continuing those investments in 2020.","John Morikis","It may not have an immediate feedback or a payback, but we're running this company longer term than just one quarter. And we absolutely believe these are the right investments to make. And so we're moving forward aggressively taking advantage as I said of not only the market, but we really think there's some competitive opportunities out here that we want to take advantage of.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. So nothing really special just going forward and investing where you need to?","John Morikis","Investing where we need to be skinning back where we can, but leaning forward we think that we've described it internally Rosemarie as a coil. We feel, we're cranking this coil down and we expect it to respond given the investments that we have in a very positive way.","Al Mistysyn","And Rosemarie we don't expect the market to be this way. But if you go back to 2007 '08 and '09 when we added 260 new stores when we came out of that you look at our market share growth not only on the three-year but the 5-year and the 10-year compounded average growth rates we think we're well above market growth and that's the attitude we're taking. We look at it long term and expect as John mentioned that coil to grow market share faster than what we've done in the past.","Rosemarie Morbelli","All right. Looking forward to that coil deploying. Thanks.","Al Mistysyn","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Perrella","Hi, guys. Quick ones on LatAm volume. Has that flattened out for you at this point and you're looking for inflection in 2020? And then just a little color on consumer pricing. Do you expect to get about half of what you get in the TAG group for 2020?","Al Mistysyn","Yeah. Chris I would say for Latin America, our volumes have, I would say, improved as the year has gone on. But where you're seeing it is, as we continue to see the devaluation, we're continually -- that team is continually having to go out with price. 60% of our raw materials are dollar-denominated, so every deflation we see in Brazil as an example we're constantly chasing with price.","So the biggest portion of our impact right now is price. But some of the things that we're doing on streamlining sales organizations and focus on the right segments and customer segment will help drive growth in the future.","John Morikis","Yeah. We're just not waiting for the market. We're not waiting for currency. We're trying to do -- we mentioned earlier, control the things we can control. And our Mexico sales were up high single-digits clearly offset by Argentina and Brazil and some of the other regions.","As Al mentioned, we're trying to be very aggressive in Brazil. The store reduction is an example of that. But we're looking to drive more profitable sales to the most efficient channels down there.","Al Mistysyn","Yeah. And Chris the second question on price. Yes. In Performance Coatings, we do still have opportunities for price in certain businesses and regions. And as you remember 2017 and 2018, we saw the big run-up in raw materials. Our industrial businesses were impacted the most. Although, raws have moderated and our expectation is in 2020, they're not back to where they were at the beginning of 2017.","So we're continuing to need price. We've expanded our margins, but we expect and I feel confident that we'll get to the high teens and low 20s. And recovering those raw material costs, plus the incremental freight cost, plus the merit increases and health care that I talked about on TAG, those are affecting our Performance Coatings Group and we're having to offset those. So, yeah, we're going to continue with price.","Christopher Perrella","All right. Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First of all, I want to kind of follow-up on your comment earlier on the auto business looking the best that it's been in your tenure. A little surprising to hear, I mean, are you starting to see like accident frequency inflect or total loss rates come down? Or is it more so just competitive dynamics where you feel like you're taking share from the channel?","John Morikis","Competitive dynamics we're taking share. I think the market -- there's been some compression we think and we've talked about that openly with safer cars and safer attributes that are going into these vehicles, which are absolutely critical. So we're doing it by the technology that we're bringing and the services that we're bringing.","The combination of Valspar and Sherwin together we have a new improved system that we think has been very well received by the marketplace. And we're really working hard to serve those customers in a way to help their throughput through those facilities.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. That's helpful. And then one other question on coronavirus. I just want to think there are like potential impacts maybe like a more of an indirect impact. Recognize you don't have high exposure to like Chinese TiO2. But are there any impacts to that market that could manifest in the global supply chain if the work stop continues? Or any other like feedstock or inputs that again if we continue to see more business shutdowns and extended holiday that could maybe have an impact on your business? Curious how you think about that?","Jim Jaye","Yeah, Chris. Let me start just by saying first when we look at this the health and safety of our employees is number one obviously. And so we're monitoring that very carefully and the recommendations that are out there.","We've suspended travel to and from China in the short-term. And we're limiting some travel inside the country to business critical. So we're doing that. But I think we're working closely with our teams there our customers our suppliers. Haven't seen to this point any negative impact and we'll continue to monitor that closely. I think it's just too early to see.","John Morikis","Now we've got some very good leadership on the ground there. Jason Wu and his team are keeping us fully abreast. And I'd say right now from a procurement standpoint we're staying close. So there's a couple of dynamics. There's a raw material piece of it and there's also the point that Jim just mentioned about trying to make sure we're doing everything we can to protect our employees and work with our customers. There's a whole lot of people trying to do everything possible to do that, but there's a lot of uncertainty and we'll react as it unfolds.","Chris Bottiglieri","Got you. Really helpful. Thank you.","John Morikis","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. So I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jaye for any additional concluding comments.","Jim Jaye","Thank you, Jesse, and thanks everybody for joining us on the call today. Myself and Eric Swanson will be available as we always are for your questions today, tomorrow and into next week. And again, appreciate your interest in Sherwin, and we'll talk to you very soon.

In order to allow more time for questions, we provided balance sheet items and other statistical data on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations 2012 Year-end Press Release.","Summarizing overall company performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2012, consolidated sales for the fourth quarter increased 7.3% to $2.22 billion, due primarily to higher paint sales volume to our Paint Stores Group and selling price increases.","For the full year, sales increased 8.8%, to $9.53 billion. Sales from acquisitions increased consolidated net sales approximately 0.9% in the quarter and year.","Currency translation rate changes decreased consolidated net sales 1% in the quarter and 1.8% for the year. Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter increased to 45.5% of sales from 42.8% of sales in the fourth quarter 2011.","For the year, gross margin increased to 44.3% of sales from 42.7% last year. The increase in gross margin for the quarter and year was due primarily to higher selling prices and the positive effect of higher production volumes, partially offset by higher year-over-year raw material costs. Selling, general and administrative expense in dollars increased $74 million in the fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter last year, an increase as a percent of sales to 37.3% from 36.4% in the same quarter last dollars but decreased as a percent of sales to 33.5% from 33.8% in 2011. Incremental SG&A from acquisitions, new stores and customer service investments accounted for the majority of the SG&A increase in the year.","Impairment charges for the planned conversion of various trademarks totaled $4.1 million in the fourth quarter and full year 2012, compared to $5.5 million in 2011.","Interest expense for the quarter increased $2.2 million, to $11.9 million. For the year, interest expense was $42.8 million, compared with $42.5 million in 2011.","Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2012 decreased to 32.7% from 88.8% in the fourth quarter of 2011.","As a reminder, fourth quarter last year income tax expense included a onetime after-tax charge of approximately $75 million to satisfy our settlement with the IRS.","For the year, our effective tax rate was 31.1% in 2012, compared to 40.4% in 2011. Excluding the IRS settlement, our full year 2011 effective tax rate would have been 30.3%.","Consolidated net income for the quarter increased $102.7 million, to $117.2 million. For the year, net income increased $238.3 million, to $680.2 million. Net income, as a percent of sales in the quarter, increased to 5.3% from 0.7% last year.

For the year, diluted net income per common share increased 56.8%, to $6.49 per share from $4.14 per share in 2011.","Now I'd like to review our performance by segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter 2012 increased 9.8%, to $1.25 billion. For the year, net sales increased 13.2%, to $5.41 billion. Sales increases in the quarter and year resulted primarily from higher paint sales volumes across all customer segments and slightly higher year-over-year selling prices.","Comparable store sales increased 9.2% in the quarter and 12.5% in the year. Regionally, in the fourth quarter, our Southwest division led all divisions, followed by Southeast division, Midwest division and Eastern Division. All 4 Paint Stores divisions recorded positive sales in the fourth quarter.","Segment operating profit for the Paint Stores Group increased 36.1%, to $181.5 million from $133.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, Paint Stores Group operating profit increased 33.5%, to $861.8 million from $645.7 million in 2011. The increase in segment profit for the quarter and year resulted from higher paint sales volumes and selling price increases that were partially offset by higher raw material costs and SG&A expense.","Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter -- operating profit margin for the fourth quarter increased to 14.6% from 11.8% last year. Profit margin for the full year 2012 increased to 15.9% from 13.5% in 2011.","Turning now to Consumer Group. Fourth quarter external net sales increased 1.4% to $255.8 million, due primarily to acquisitions, partially offset by lower sales volumes to most of the group's larger retail customers.","For the year, Consumer Group sales increased 3.7%, to $1.32 billion from $1.27 billion in 2011, as a result of higher selling prices and acquisitions.","Acquisitions increased net sales by 6.5% in the quarter and 3.2% in the year. Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter decreased to $23.3 million from $30.2 million last year, due primarily to a more normal seasonal reduction in our internal finished goods inventory compared to fourth quarter last year and to higher raw material costs that were partially offset by selling price increases.","For the year, segment operating profit increased 24.6%, to $216.4 million from $173.7 million in 2011, due primarily to selling price increases and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by higher raw material cost.","As a percent of net sales, Consumer Group's operating profit in the fourth quarter decreased to 9.1% from 12% last year. For the year, operating margin increased to 16.4% from 13.6% in 2011.","For our Global Finishes Group, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 5.1%, to $487.1 million, due primarily to higher sales volumes and selling price increases, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation.","For the year, Global Finishes Group sales increased 4.4%, to $1.96 billion, due primarily to selling price increases, higher sales volumes and acquisitions partially offset by unfavorable currency.","Acquisitions increased the group sales in the U.S. -- in U.S. dollars by 1.8% in the year. Currency translations decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 1.4% in the quarter and decreased sales by 3.5% in the year.","Global Finishes Group segment operating profit for the fourth quarter increased to $34.1 million from $13 million last year. For the year, segment operating profit increased to $147.2 million from $90.3 million last year.","In the quarter and year, higher selling prices, volume growth and good expense control more than offset raw material cost inflation. Unfavorable currency translation and acquisitions reduced segment profit $3.4 million in the quarter and $11.9 million in the year.","As a percent of net sales, Global Finishes Group operating profit was 7% in the fourth quarter, compared to 2.8% last year, and 7.5% for the year compared to 4.8% in 2011.","For our Latin American Coatings Group, net sales increased 5.2%, to $231.5 million in the quarter, and increased 0.9%, to $836.1 million for the full year, due primarily to higher year-over-year selling prices and increased sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation.","Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 6.7% in the quarter and 10.2% in the year.

The Santa Clara case, involving claims of public nuisance brought by 10 cities and counties in California against 5 defendant companies, continues to move forward. At a recent pretrial hearing, the judge presiding over the case set a trial date of June 29, 2013, to allow the parties more time to complete the discovery process and file this positive pretrial motion.","That concludes my review of our results for fourth quarter and full year 2012. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2013. Chris?","Christopher M. Connor","Thanks, Bob, good morning, everybody thanks for joining us today. 2012 was a year of many milestones for Sherwin-Williams. For the year, we set all-time high watermarks for consolidated sales, net income, earnings per share and net operating cash. We also reported record sales and earnings per share in each of the 4 quarters during the year. And 3 of our 4 reportable segments established all-time peaks in sales and segment profit this past year.","Additionally, our Paint Stores Group eclipsed the 3,500 store mark, and we recruited more than 1,000 college graduates into our management-training program, both all-time highs.","Finally, late in the year, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Comex. Once this since transaction is completed, it will be the largest acquisition in our company's history.","These milestones and others we celebrated in 2012 were the direct result of our decision to stay the course, to stick with our strategy when market conditions collapsed back in 2008 and 2009. Since that time, we have continued to invest in new distribution and new product technology. We continue to invest in quality and productivity initiatives across our supply chain. We continue to recruit right motivated men and women into our management-training programs and prepare them for leadership assignments.","We believe the effects of these investments are cumulative and the outcomes we achieved this past year are repeatable. It's pretty obvious, based on our SG&A spending in 2012 and particularly in the fourth quarter, that the pace of these investments actually increased throughout the year.","While the higher SG&A did dampen earnings, we believe the timing of these investments couldn't be better. Most of the $235 million increase in SG&A for the year fell into 1 of 3 of buckets. The largest was our investment in new stores, including new sales and customer service employees, which accounted for more than half of the overall SG&A increase.","The second bucket was incentive compensation, which was higher this year, as our selling organization and field management shared in the benefits of their record results.","The smallest bucket was acquisitions and infrastructure investment, including IT. If you believed that 2012 marked the beginning of a sustainable recovery in many of our end markets, now is the ideal time to build sales and customer service capacity, which is precisely what we did.","In 2012, our Paint Stores Group added 70 net new stores, bringing our store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean to 3,520, compared to 3,450 locations 1 year ago. Our plan for 2013 calls for new store openings in the range of 70 to 80 locations.","We also hired a 1,140 new sales and customer service employees to bolster our store staffing and improve our territory coverage. Our Latin American Coatings Group added 11 net new stores during the year, for a total now of 276 locations throughout the region.","These investments in new stores, store staff and rep coverage pay for themselves in a very short period of time. Consistent investment relies on strong, dependable cash generation. Again, in 2012, our net operating cash increased $152 million, to $888 million, or about 9.3% of sales.","If you add back the cash settlement paid to the IRS that Bob mentioned earlier in the first quarter of this year, cash from operations for the year approached 10% of net sales, our long-term objective.","A portion of this increase came from our continued progress in working capital management. Our working capital ratio declined to 10.8% of sales at year-end from 10.9% of sales at the end of 2011.","In anticipation of closing the Comex acquisition in the first half of 2013, in December, we placed $1 billion of new debt in 5- and 30-year maturities at a blended average rate of 2.1%.","As a result, we finished the year with an uncharacteristically high cash balance of $863 million. During the fourth quarter, we acquired 800,000 shares of the company's stock for treasury, bringing our full year total to 4.6 million shares at an average cost of $121.25 per share and a total investment of $558 million for the year.","At year-end, we had remaining authorization to acquire another 16.5 million shares. Over the past year, we returned $161 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends. 2012 marked our 34th consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a string we intend to continue.","This year, at our February meeting of the Board of Directors, I will recommend approval of a payout rate for 2013 consistent with our policy of 30% at prior year's earnings per share.","I'll close my comments this morning by highlighting yet one more all-time record of guidance for 2013. Our full year guidance calls for diluted earnings per share in the range of $7.35 to $7.55 per share, a 15.6% increase at the midpoint on mid-single-digit sales growth.","For the first quarter, we're earnings per share in a range of $1.03 to $1.13, a 13.7% increase at midrange on top of a strong first quarter in 2012, and we'll accomplish that on low-single-digit sales growth. Neither of these ranges include any earnings contributions from the Comex acquisition, but do include the approximately $21 million of additional interest expense on the incremental debt.","While some members on The Street are above these ranges, this constitutes the largest increase in full year earnings guidance in both dollars and percentage terms in our company's history.","While our expectation for top line growth may appear modest, it will come almost entirely from volume. Nearly all of the impact from our previous price increases have annualized and our guidance this year anticipates very little incremental pricing.","We begin each year with some level of uncertainty, and 2013 is no exception. Despite the steadily improving health of many of our end markets and the positive trends, we've seen in the cost of certain commodities, we remain cautious. Market demand and volume recovery has been erratic across geographies and end markets, and we expect that will continue. Currency translation is also likely to remain a headwind to sales and earnings throughout the year, particularly in our Latin American markets. Our raw material basket has many moving parts as well. But in total, it remains biased towards inflation.","While we have seen some easing in titanium pricing over the back half of 2012, propylene, the key raw material feedstock, has increased 30%, from $0.55 per pound last quarter to $0.72 per pound today. This will keep some upward pressure on the price of monomers and latex in the first half of 2013.","Based upon our assumptions and improving price stability in titanium and increased volatility in propylene, we would expect average year-over-year raw material cost inflation to be in the low single-digit range in 2013. Our visibility in each of these areas improved significantly as we go through the year. And as always, we'll adjust our expectations accordingly.","Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now the team would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you give us a sense as to what your full year '13 guidance assumes for U.S. paint gallons for the industry? And if you could, of course, take it one step further in terms of expectations for existing and new home sales?","Robert J. Wells","Well, clearly, we're most optimistic about U.S. architectural market. And we do believe that residential will probably be the strongest driver in that market again. But just as a reminder to everyone on the call, U.S. architectural gallons typically grow at a rate in the range of GDP. And even in a recovery year, if you consider 1.5x to 2x that rate, you're still in the, probably, 3% to 4% range for U.S. architectural volume.","Sean P. Hennessy","And this is Sean Hennessy. And on top of that, when you talk about this gallonage, when you start looking at this guidance, again, last year, when you look -- and we will just talk about stores. Stores for the year, the selling price was up single -- mid-single digits. This year, we really have very slight pricing in our guidance this year. So we're going up against that pricing that we had last year. And so the sales are really more indicative of higher percentage of unit growth.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then switching to global finishes. Were volumes for the quarter in line with the expectations? It seemed to be a little bit stronger than 4Q '11. And if you can parse out the various verticals, how they performed during the quarter.","Sean P. Hennessy","Actually, global finishes, when we take a look at the quarter, performed very close to what we had expected. And I will tell you that the sales were in the high end of the range. It really was because of stores being a little bit stronger than what we've thought. As far as the 3 segments, I'm not prepared -- I don't have -- when you look at the automotive and so forth, we're not prepared to go through that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","There has been significant M&A in Paints. With your Comex deal, PPG acquiring Akzo's U.S. business. Do you expect that pace to continue? And what does it mean for margins in the industry if you remove some of these underperforming businesses?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, obviously, we don't expect that Paints like that to continue. Those were 2 extremely large deals in our industry and the universe of property of that size and scale are diminishing. So as we have commented for many years, P.J., from our M&A strategy, there's an awful lot of small bolt-on, both technologies and controlled distribution plays. So I think that's more will likely what you'll see going forward. I don't know that these 2 deals will have a significant impact on margin. The bigger issue on margins, in our industry, as we've shared with the investment communities, has been the impact of raw material cost pressures and the ability to pass those along over a period of time. And I think those dynamics will continue to play out pretty much unchanged, regardless of these potential acquisitions that may or may not close.","Sean P. Hennessy","And the other thing, P.J. This is, again, Sean Hennessy. When you speak of operating margins, I would say that a lot of this, the infrastructure, the admin costs, the percent of sales, those are the things that you're going to see up -- are going to see operating margin from us expand from these, but more from infrastructure and those type of SG&A efficiencies.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And secondly, you mentioned there was normal inventory decline in the consumer group. Was there a destocking by your channel partner that's now behind us? And do you see a rebound in 2013?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, I think this is actually, we try to use the word internal. And if you -- and I'm just going to go back a year. If remember in the third quarter of 2011, we did bring the inventory in line. And the reason we did that is in the first half of the year in 2011, we are coming -- we're anniversarying the shortages in some of, some products that we needed and we overspent in 2010. So we allowed the inventory to build in 2011. In third quarter, we allowed that inventory to drop, which depressed Consumer Group's operating margin. And what we said at that time is this was a little abnormal for us in the fourth quarter when you look at the year. So if you look at the third quarter 2011 in Consumer, the operating margin was depressed. The fourth quarter was a little higher than normal. And now we're anniversarying those situations. So it's internal inventory. Our inventory remains fairly flat in the third quarter in Consumer, and then it dropped in the fourth quarter, which is more normal for our sales curve and in our history of our company. So this year, the third quarter operating margins for Consumer was very strong. This year, the fourth quarter was depressed. And for the full year, the consumer group had really nice operating margins. Next year, I don't expect that third and fourth quarter adjustment to occur again. So it will be more normalized next year.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Chris Nocella of RBC.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Maybe can you break your sales growth guidance directionally, at least, between the segments for 2013?","Sean P. Hennessy","I think that if you take a look at it, we prefer not to do that. I mean, we really don't do that. But I think what you can probably tell is we're -- Store Group, with the unit volume, will probably be the strongest.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just for 2012, what's your best guess in how that volume through the stores was split between new build and repaint?","Robert J. Wells","I'd say it was probably very consistent, Chris, with the kind of the overall market environment. We have said that, for a long period of time, that the new construction market would account for somewhere in the 20% to 25% demand for architectural coatings. That was probably a little depressed from that number because we still have not seen the kind of rebound, both in housing, as well as commercial start. So -- let's assume in the high teens was the amount of the gallons that were used for new construction. The remainder would have been for maintenance and redecorating.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just a couple of questions, one just a clarification on volumes. Of the 12.5% same-store sales growth in Paint Store Sales Group this year, were you saying that half was price, half was volume?","Sean P. Hennessy","No, more than half, but very close, because of that mid-single-digit.","Robert J. Wells","More than half of volume, Don.","Sean P. Hennessy","Right.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So are you forecasting volumes to be relatively flat. Is that what's implied in your -- or that the growth will be equivalent in 2013 to 2012 in terms of your volume level for Paint Stores Group?","Robert J. Wells","When you say volume flat, flat for 2012?","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","No, I meant growth rate the same, flat growth rate, yes.","Robert J. Wells","Right.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then one additional question, Chris, did I hear you say you expect TiO2 to stabilize this year?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Don, we would expect TiO2 pricing to be more stable in 2013 that we've seen over the past few years.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just final question. I know you have some tough comps in first quarter. So I was a little surprised that you're still expecting some low-single-digit growth. Is that maybe you can  just give us some more background on why you think you're going to get growth over such tough comp?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think Bob commented that we really have confidence in particularly the North American residential repaint market. And we have been accelerating in that space. We've been seeing the return of the painting contractor do a higher percentage of the purchase of architectural coatings throughout the year, and those trend lines are continuing. So despite the fact that we got a pretty high hurdle on the jump, we're giving the kind of guidance from the clarity that we can see in the quarter and we expect to be able to hit these numbers.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Chris, I appreciate the disaggregation of SG&A that you've provided. If we put the Comex deal on the side for a moment, do you think that the uplift in 2013 on the SG&A line will be similar to what you experienced in 2012? Perhaps you could comment on a forward-looking basis on some of the 3 buckets that you mentioned there and what that looks like for this year?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. So if you look at SG&A for the year, it actually was down as a percent of sales. So the fourth quarter had a little bit of acceleration. Overall, it was a kind of discipline that we could bring to managing that part that I think was at play throughout the year. We did comment about the decision to continue to heavy-up. I think we began the year with a little lower store count expectation and kind of accelerated to get to that 70 store in the fourth quarter. 40 of our 70 stores actually came in the fourth quarter this year in terms of their openings. So we were a little late-in-the-year heavy-handed in that particular area. And that's been pretty typical for the way that the stores flow in for us in past years, as well. In our expectations for next year, that SG&A will continue to improve as a percent of sales. We're going to continue to make these investments. We'll put in more stores next year than this year as we guided. So I think that it's been a pretty consistent track record here and it should continue again into 2013.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And second question, I think in the past you've commented a bit on your efforts to minimize the amount of TIO2 required as a company to the extent that, that makes sense through reformulation efforts in certain cases. Can you provide an update on that? Is it ongoing? Is there -- where do you stand now? Is there more to take out in 2013?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think we have commented, Kevin, along with a number of other of our global coatings competitors, who are also purchasers of this material, that there are a lot of activities under way to try to eliminate the amount of titanium load neither in a typical gallon of paint. We have talked about the ability to make those conversions to lower grades. We have titanium, particularly outside the North America, and those activities are at play as well. And I think the numbers that you hear, that perhaps 5% to -- as much as 10% of this titanium eventually can perhaps be displaced is not an inappropriate target. We've also commented that given our focus on the professional painting contractor and unwillingness to really change a lot of the raw material content in these products, who are likely to be lagger on that path, because this will be more of future products as opposed to our current product line. And I can tell you that all those activities continue to be under way with our R&D team.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin of CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Just curious about the store growth that you had this year and your expectations for next year. Are you focused on particular regions? And how would those regions compare with where you'll bulk up once the Comex deal gets approved?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Nils. As we have commented throughout our time here, that the Store growth will come literally across the entire geographic footprint that we've identified -- stores that we've managed is Canada, U.S. and the Caribbean. We have around 160 district managers, each of whom built a real estate plan. We don't have a single one of these districts that considers themself fully penetrated. So we have opportunities, literally, in every market across the United States. And typically, what we do is try to do about 70% of our store openings annually would be typical fill-ins, where we're giving one store to each of these districts. And then about 30% of that count will be more of a heavy-up concentration in markets where we're underpenetrated. We shared with the investment community that throughout all of Canada and the Western markets of the United States are where those underpenetrated markets are for us. And so we'll continue to heavy-up in those spaces. If we're successful in concluding the Comex transaction, their 300-plus store count beautifully lays over that density map and really strengthens our Canadian and Western Market store count. Even with those stores, however, we'll still be far from what we would consider to be full penetration. So this notion of continuing to add these stores at about this pace for years and years to come would remain part of our strategy. We've been talking about the ability to get to 5,000 stores throughout this North American geography. And with the addition of the Comex stores, plus the 80 stores we're planning to open this year, 70 to 80 stores that we have in the guidance, we would still be below 4,000 stores. So a long way to go.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Yes. And then just on your incremental margin in the Paint Stores Group was quite strong this year, around 30%. With new products bulking up on your SG&A, can you -- do you think you'll be able to continue that same sort of incremental margin or operating leverage in 2013 and beyond? Or is it -- will it decelerate some?","Sean P. Hennessy","Just as you mentioned, the ROS that we -- margin that we did run the Stores Group this year was an all-time high, clips in the prior by 15 -- it was 15.5 the prior high. This year, 15.9. So when we used to talk about the 15.5 years ago, we'd say that's -- we don't think that's the top. We think if we continue to -- can get admin as a percent of sales down and other types of admin costs we think that we can beat it. We feel the same way of the 15.9. I don't think that next year, our management -- we still believe that we're going to have incremental flow-through that's very strong, as long as the market continues to recover.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silverstein with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A couple of questions, if I may. I'm trying to understand your revenue guidance in light of what you're talking about improving markets. You're starting out the year with double -- with mid-single-digit growth in Paints, and you're going to end the year, overall, with low single-digit growth. So there's a deceleration coming in after the first quarter. And to follow up on earlier question, the first quarter seems to be the most difficult comps on year-over-year basis. I just want to understand with the contractors coming back, with commercial construction accelerating, with the housing market continuing to do better, why would you expect a slowdown in your growth rate as the year unfolds?","Sean P. Hennessy","I'm just trying to pull out the press release. But I think in the first quarter, we gave you guidance of low-single-digit and mid-single-digit for the year. That would tell you that the second, third and fourth quarter is going to be stronger than the first quarter as far as year-over-year comparisons. And so, secondly, if you sit there and say, well, if start adding the 2 years together. Again, first quarter last year was the quarter, if you remember, stores grew kind of 20 -- approximately 20% comp store gain, and nearly half of that was price, whereas for the full year, we ended up with the mid-single digits for price. So as we go along, we're going to go have that hurdle of the price not helping us as we go along. So when you go from the first quarter at mid -- at low-single digits to mid, we see it exactly -- probably a little differently than you do.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Your press release is correct. But I think what you've said on this conference call, and you may have misspoken, that's what I picked up on, was the opposite. But okay, with the press release, it makes sense. You start out slow and you accelerate as the year unfolds. My second question is on the guidance range that you provided. It's $0.10 for the first quarter and $0.10 for the year. I guess I'm surprised by either too tight of a guidance for the year or too loose of a guidance first quarter. How do you feel about that? I mean, it looks like that there's -- it just seems that there should have been a wider guidance for the year. But perhaps, you'll feel better as the year unfolds in the total developments in the market?","Sean P. Hennessy","I think, it goes back to, Dmitry, I don't know how long you've been -- I lost track of when you started covering us, but prior to 2008, we used to give $0.10 guidance...","Robert J. Wells","Range.","Sean P. Hennessy","Range. For the range. And when you take a look at what's happened, we actually at one year, we came out with $1 range. We said our EPS would come in between $3 and $4.","Robert J. Wells","I remember that.","Sean P. Hennessy","And we actually came in at $3.78 that year. And when you take a look at it, it was because of the variability that was going on in raws and the markets. And there was a lot of different names that was going on in 2009, 2010. And as we said back then we got a lot of pressure: \"Why did you widen it too far?\" We said as we get more and more clarity, you'll see us reduce the size of this, the range.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","So the way to, I guess, really, the key, at least, way to interpret this is that the market seems to have subsided into a more normalized behavior that's more predictable from historical basis?","Sean P. Hennessy","Correct.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","My questions will be easier. My first one was just trying to piece apart the guidance. It's a little tricky right now, because you're not factoring in any benefit from Comex but, obviously, you're taking a hit on the interest line. And just wanted to think through some of the moving parts. So on the share repurchase, you would think you are going to probably pull back with the deal ahead of you. Are you factoring anything related to share repurchase into the guidance?","Sean P. Hennessy","Dennis, that was the hardest part to do this guidance. Because whether we complete the Comex deal or not, we're going to pay that interest. But we do have a factor -- we have a couple different scenarios when Comex occurs and so forth, I will tell you our guidance right now does show stock repurchase.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then just on the tax rate, what should we assume there?","Sean P. Hennessy","We're a little higher than what we experienced the last 2 years, last year with the adjustments in the IRS and this year, when we came in at 31.1%. We think that we're going to be a little higher than that 31.1%, but no higher than 33%.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. So I think if you run that through and the top line assumptions. So might think you've talked about maybe it's modest margin expansion for the full year. And it sounds like you expect SG&A to be down on a year-over-year basis percentage of sales. So can you maybe just help us bridge that on a gross margin line, sort of what you're assuming and kind of that guidance on the low-single-digit raw material inflation, how that sorts out with some of the other action that you have?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, we don't want to go through line by line and tell you our guidance. But I think, mathematically, I think it's pretty easy to do if you use a tax rate a little higher than have today. Interest $20-some million higher than today. And you back in and if you use a slightly smaller share count, it's going to tell you what our operating margin is there. There is going to be improvement there. And so if you show the SG&A as a percent of sales improving, and I think that you can back into the gross margin if there's going to be gross margin improvement this year.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. I guess just on some of the top line. I think, Chris, you may have commented that maybe you're a little bit more conservative or conservative on the end channels just given some of volatility that you've seen lately. Is that true to across the domestic markets? Is there any one area where you guys are seeing maybe more volatility or more hesitancy among customers that makes, maybe, a little less confident in the recovery?","Christopher M. Connor","I think the government actually came out this morning with the GDP estimates for the fourth quarter, which were retracted. And so when we look at our core more commercial, our protective and marine segments, commercial starts, those are things that we have a little less clarity at, Dennis. I think our guidance and our confidence really stems from this residential repaint domestic North American housing market, and that can carry us through a lot of rougher spots. And as we said, as we get into the year and we start to see a little better market dynamics unfolding, we'll be able to comment on that. But for right now, I think we're probably relying on this residential repaint market to be the driver.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley of ISI Group.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","On the consumer segment last quarter, you had stated that some of the weakness that you had there was across most product types and channels. Is that still the case? And what do you think is still driving that unit weakness in that segment?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, I think we did exactly say that, Matt, that our sales, both to our customers and their out-the-doors lagged the same sales performance that we're seeing through our own stores. Time will tell as we get into the selling season and come through the winter weather and that the spring paint season picks up for these folks. But our share position there has been maintained with the exception of the Walmart business, which we've commented on in the past. We did take some additional private label business there, that we're shifting from our manufacturer to a competitors' sourcing. And that was somewhat of an impact. But even factoring that out, this was a fairly flat performing segment for us.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","What do you think the long-run organic growth rate should be within that segment?","Robert J. Wells","Well, we've commented for a long period of time that our expectations are flat, low single-digit sales growth for this group. And this comes from the dynamics of the competitive landscape that we've created for ourselves in the United States. So the particular retail partners that we enjoy the business with will -- we benefit when they grow and improve. And time will tell how that all shakes out.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a quick one on the inventory. Your inventory is basically down a little bit year-over-year. Was that primarily driven by this plan in raw material cost or your unit inventory's still down year-over-year?","Sean P. Hennessy","No, our unit inventory is down. We're in pretty good shape with inventory. But there was improvement with terms and so forth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","When we talk about this environment you're seeing, Chris, for 2013, with the flatter price outlook, do you expect competition for volume to be a little more aggressive because price is not making up the difference for some paint manufacturers?","Christopher M. Connor","We've been blessed with great competition for 147 years, Chuck. We absolutely expect that there'll be competition for these gallons. And we face that the dynamic every single year, and we would expect to be in that same environment again this year.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","But do you think with less price inflation in there, it gets a little tougher, Chris?","Christopher M. Connor","I'm not sure that I do. I mean, I think it's tough when you have price and then it's tough when there isn't price. We've been in this environment before. Even within the last several years, we've had periods of time when there was -- I think we went 22 months without a price increase back before this titanium run. And so we got through that segment. We had gallon gains in there against these same competitors that you're talking about. It really comes down to the quality of the product, the distribution support, the caliber of the field selling organization. These are all areas where we've been muscle-building, and we would expect to be able to actually be in a little stronger position this cycle that we were the last time, given the expansion in store counts and the widening of the gap of our service capabilities.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","All right. And one for Sean. When you're talking about the guidance for 2013, do you have any expenses in there for the Comex transaction simply for what you have to spend on ahead of getting the deal done, similar to the debt financing?","Sean P. Hennessy","Very little, Chuck. I think that -- you can imagine, we have some advisers that we are working with, but I would say it's going to be really immaterial to our first quarter.","Robert J. Wells","So we would see those immaterial in the first quarter, and you're still expecting a close by the end of the quarter.","Christopher M. Connor","That's in the hands of the government. And we are not really able to comment on that. We would -- we'd love to be able to make that date work, but time will tell.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","So we'll see that bulk of the transaction costs apart -- and separating from those from any integration costs, we'll see the bulk of those when you close?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. The quarter that the close, you're going to have the inventory step-up. You' going to have some other expenses, onetime only expenses that quarter will definitely be -- will be dilutive from the Comex acquisition because of those first quarter expenses, then it'll start to be accretive.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob today. Chris, I just want to clarify your comment on pricing for '13. I heard you say that there wasn't going to be any real benefit from pricing at '13. I just wanted to see if you're talking about no incremental price increases from here on out or does that mean that you wouldn't see the benefit from just anniversarying the price increases you've already done? In other words, is there truly no benefit year-over-year or is it just no benefit from here on out?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I think when we made the comment, we didn't anticipate any pricing activity in the year, given where we see the raw material basket at this point in time, that guidance is as good as the word of raw material suppliers. And as we've commented frequently, we really are a raw material input cost pricer to our customers. So if we're able to maintain these kinds of raw material costs as we're entering the year or what we're forecasting the year, then we would anticipate very little pricing activity. Our last price increase was actually in February of last year. So there is a little bit of pricing still. We're at the very tail end of integrating that. So for the most part of this year, there won't be any lift from pricing activity.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up as it relates to the gross margin outlook and if pricing is going to be kind of flat to modestly and if your raw outlook is for low-single-digit inflation, I don't think about there being much fixed cost in your model. I think more of a variable cost model. So does that imply your thinking and currently is sort of roughly flat to just modestly up gross margins?","Sean P. Hennessy","No, I think, when you start taking -- look, this is when you start asking sequentially. It's probably your answer there, sequentially, you can see that. But I think that if you go quarter-over-quarter, that first quarter, that gross margin was really depressed because the raws we're anniversarying and so forth and we were putting the price increase in. But we do expect to have gross margin improvement in the first quarter. And -- or else, we would it be able to get over that great quarter we had. But sequentially, I can understand your answer there.","Christopher M. Connor","Brian, and our margins have always been helped too as volumes increase, your point about the fixed costs of the company. So these incremental gallons start going through this entire supply chain, that has an impact on us as well, too. So for Sean's earlier answer to Dennis, if you do the math on that, I think you'll get to -- what we would expect to be another good year of margin, gross margin improvement for the company.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in North America, 2 of your larger store competitors are apparently merging later this year. Do you anticipate any change in competitive behavior? Or how will that dynamic kind of influence you going forward?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, given the status of their acquisition as well, which has not been finalized, I think it would just be inappropriate to make any comments about that at this time.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Nomura Securities.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","The question is on the gross profit dollar line. Can you give us, by segment, the delta in gross profit dollars that you often do?","Sean P. Hennessy","Sure. In Paint Stores Group was $96.2 million. In Consumer Group, it was actually backwards, $1.3 million. In the Global Finishes Group, $26.9 million. In the Latin America Group, it was an increase of $4.4 million.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","It looks almost as if in your Paint Stores Group, that you've kind of gotten back everything you gave away last year in the fourth quarter.","Sean P. Hennessy","That's -- I'll tell you that definitely looks -- I will tell you right there that you're accurate.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then one other question, just on reinvesting. Clearly, the acquisition of Comex is a major reinvest. You've talked about raising SG&A for new stores on reinvest. Where are we in other areas of the business? You've mentioned in the past that we don't need any capacity to come on board, I assume, for manufacturing. Is that still the case? And if you weren't doing the acquisition, how many stores would you have opened organically.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I don't think the store opening organic has been impacted at all by this acquisition. We are steady on this pace, 80 is a great number. We've said that's probably the sustainable number, as low as 50 to 60, as high as 100 over a long period of time, 80 is kind right in the sweet spot, on this march up to 5,000 stores. So there's been no capacity constraint or corporate constraint on our Stores Group to hold them back from growing in an appropriate pace. So I don't expect that to change. Regarding other investment opportunities there around the world for us, we have commented that after a fairly robust M&A period of building out infrastructure, both in Europe and Asia-Pacific, to service our OEM product finishes businesses that we feel comfortable with the infrastructure we have. Future acquisitions would likely be more, smaller technology bolt-ons than they would be brick-and-mortar. And the same can be said of Latin America, where we also have a pretty good infrastructure. We still remain interested in building all those businesses, and we'll look for the appropriate deals to do. North America still remains the key market where we have the ability to do open stores at this pace. And so that's where you can see us really focus our efforts going forward.","Sean P. Hennessy","And if I may, the other thing that we've definitely are investing in is IT systems. If you tracked our company for quite a while back in the '90s, working capital was in the high-teens, almost 20%. We think what really help us -- what helped the operations to do that was IT. And I think we're starting to see some of that. That's going to help our cash flow, and, I think, down the road, as we continue to try to improve our cash generation for sales. So I think we're also doing that around the world as [indiscernible] bought these assets.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Before I go, is it okay to ask for the inventory adjustment dollar amount that you usually take at the end of the year, if it's available?","Sean P. Hennessy","It's not available. We're not there yet.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the SG&A spending. It looks like the unallocated portion, or the administrative line, was up significantly this year in dollars and as a percentage of sales. To the extent that, that's where some of the incentive comp or infrastructure spending is, is that the sort of right level to think of as a base going forward? Or was it impacted by the timing of incentive comp as the share price was rising? Just helping us understand how that -- what the new base is going forward there?","Sean P. Hennessy","Everything you said there is really accurate. Really, this segment was really -- when you talk about the infrastructure, we just talked about IT as well as the compensation, including that stock-based compensation, this is where the growth occurred. I think from that from that standpoint, I think you'll see that over time flatten out and, actually, especially on the infrastructure spending, it will begin to reduce. The other thing that's in this group is or in this segment is our interest expense. Our interest expense has been flat the last 2 years in that $42 million to $43 million range with the $1 billion debt that will go up $20 million. So I think that any efficiencies we get in some of the other areas are going to be offset by the interest.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So it sounds like, so just to follow-up that, if you excluded the interest expense, you would expect the remainder to go down?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, over time, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","One of the strongest pillars of the story has been your ability to get price and offset the raw mats. And surprisingly, in the last probably 45 days, the biggest raw mat basket, the petrochemicals and the propylene in particular, jumped, I think, meaningfully higher than most people would have guessed 4, 5 months ago. Was it just a bad timing? Or why wouldn't we be able to get some price on the back of that big raw material increase this year?","Christopher M. Connor","I think, as we've commented, Duffy, I mean, we  look at the basket of raws as they impact the company as opposed to any one individual segment. We comment about individual segments when they drive the entire basket up. But as we've given guidance about what we expect that total raw material impact for the company to be this year, that would not be the level that would cause us to take pricing to our customers.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then, if I remember, you guys used to sell some Pratt & Lambert paint through the Ace store system. How big is your business, Pratt & Lambert and other stuff, that would go through that, that may be at risk with a deal that Ace is doing with Valspar.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, you have a good memory. We have had, over the years, a number of independent Ace dealers take on the Pratt & Lambert product line. In this environment that Ace operates in, they can endorse programs and make it available to their co-ops through their distribution channel. But most of these independent dealers do carry products that they buy outside of that Ace relationship. And so we do not have a big exposure at Ace at this point in time. And the number of dealers that do carry Pratt & Lambert may or may not elect to continue with it per their announcement of their new paint partner. So time will tell. But that would not be an issue that you would hear us commenting on as impacting the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","You talked to us about in the fourth stepping up some SG&A investments across the business. I'm curious what that the target is in terms of the payback from that, if it's market share or if it's volume growth? What are you thinking that the payback might look like relative to those investments?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I think that, and that's why I also mentioned the cash flow earlier, Eric. I think some of the IT spending that we did will actually help our working capital and actually help our cash generation outside the country. And we've been working on that for many years. Again, 40 of the 70 stores came into -- were opened in the fourth quarter. And so that's -- that's a high percentage in the fourth quarter. And I think down the road, I think they'll perform just like all the other stores do. And I think that just timing has caused that. So we expect to hopefully gain market share as we continue to open stores. So I think you're going to see the same timing from the stores. And I think in the next year or 2, you're going to see some nice cash flow coming out of our nondomestic group.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Great. And then, secondly, a year ago, I think the guidance for 2012, the initial guidance, you ended up exceeding by a pretty meaningful amount, perhaps $1 a share. I'm curious if you look back a year ago and think about the factors that you were considering and then where the year ended up, what did you do or what played out differently in '12 that allowed you to exceed by such a wide margin in your original expectation?","Sean P. Hennessy","I would tell you, $0.97, it was $5.52 to $6.49. And so when you take a look at it, a couple of things occurred, Eric. Number one was our sales performance at Stores. I think that Stores really had a great year. I think number two was the margin improvement in Global Finishes Group. I think that was stronger than what we had expected. I think that integration, where the fourth quarter 2011 was a little heavy in SG&A because of that integration. I think that if you look at that Global Finishes Group and what they were able to do, I think those were the 2 areas. Latin America Group did improve. And Consumer, I think, was fairly close to what we expected.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Silke Kueck of JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering whether I could try one more raw materials question, if you're not tired of it yet.","Christopher M. Connor","Of course, you can.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So what you said is this, is that your TiO2 prices seemed more stable in 2013. So in a way, if they stayed stable from where they were at the end of 2012, that really would mean that there's still a significant benefit on a year-over-year basis in the first half of '13, right?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, there was a decline in TiO2 pricing in the back half of '12, which put TiO2 pricing below, certainly, below 2012 peak at year-end.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And my memory with propylene prices is set. I mean, I know they're back at $0.77. But the last thing -- but same thing happened last year. And that is if you look at propylene prices for February, March, April, I think they were like $0.77, maybe they were $0.76. So on a year-over-year basis, like the propylene costs may not been -- I see how that cost sequentially, they'll move, but a new year-over-year basis, like those comparisons may not be as difficult as you make them out at first sight?","Robert J. Wells","I think a low single-digit inflation expectation across our total raw material basket is not -- I don't think that's a dire outlook. Certainly, not relative to our expectation over the past few years at the beginning -- at this time in the year.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I can understand how you're like reasonably -- confident that, like, this 45% gross margin is probably sustainable for like at least another 6 months or so.","Christopher M. Connor","I think that's right.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. The second thing is I wanted to understand what really happened to volumes in the -- on the Consumer Group side. Like where -- so because this is now the second quarter in a row of volumes were negative. And what exactly is happening? Because I didn't detect these volume declines like anywhere else.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, it's mostly Walmart, Silke. And as we've commented, we've been losing share inside that for a while there.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I thought you gave that up already.","Sean P. Hennessy","The brand and material was replaced by Glidden immediately. And the significant portion of Walmart's vibe has been their private level under their Color Place brand name. And so the process there was that was to be a phase-in over a period of time. We were going from some percentage of their distributions that we supplied to significantly lower. And those adjustments were taking place in the third and fourth quarter. That's really the headwind that our Consumer Group was facing.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, I understand. Sorry, I forgot that. And has anything changed in your goal to explore the Canadian Stores market now that PPG owns the Glidden stores there?","Robert J. Wells","Well, our intentions have always been to continue to organically open stores throughout Canada, following our Stores model. And one of the real bright spots in this potential Comex acquisition is a brand called General Paint that operates out of British Columbia. And that will bring a significant store count boost to our plans in Canada. So we would expect to make significant progress in Canada this year organically, and then maybe get a real shot in the arm when we get this transaction closed.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you enlighten us what the Comex exposure is in Canada?","Robert J. Wells","Yes, General is the brand name. The store count in Canada was...","Christopher M. Connor","78 stores.","Robert J. Wells","78 stores. Yes.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And if I could, a last question is like TiO2 question again. I wanted to ask it with raw materials, then I forgot. Has sulfur-based TiO2 from China made a difference to the global supply demand balance at all? I understand that Sherwin uses chloride-based TiO2, but I was just wondering whether you had a view?","Robert J. Wells","Silke, clearly, the chloride producers have been talking about soft market conditions and weak demand all year long. And whether that is truly weak global demand or less than robust demand partially offset or partially satisfied by increasing sulfide capacity is hard to tell. But we suspect that it might be some of the latter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just one quick question. So when we look at the sales growth that you saw and earnings growth you saw in the Paint Store or throughout your businesses, and so the Paint Store Group, Lat Am, the Consumer side, they vary pretty significantly. If you have any information or data on it, can you let us know kind of which one Comex might have mirrored more likely through the fourth quarter and 2012? Was it closer to the Paint Store type growth or was it more similar to the Lat Am growth?","Robert J. Wells","I think it's probably a hybrid of both of those. Their model would indicate that because they have such a strong distribution network and they're selling to the professional painting contractor, they would have participated in more the Mexican market growth scenario. And we think Mexico actually is a pretty good place right now. Their GDP outperformed the U.S. this past year. Their housing markets and their commercial construction businesses were stronger than ours were. So their performance should mirror closer to that. We have not commented on this private company's results yet. And we will, obviously, when we close, give you a lot more transparency there, John. But at this point in time, I think you just have to kind of look at the Mexican GDP market and know that Comex would be a good proxy for this same kind of businesses, housing, et cetera, that we enjoyed through our Stores business year.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional closing comments.","Robert J. Wells","Thanks, Jesse. Let me wrap of this morning by asking you all to save the date of Thursday, May 23, on your calendars.

In order to allow more time for questions, we provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at sherwin.com under Investor Relations First Quarter Press Release.","Summarizing overall company performance for first quarter 2013 versus first quarter 2012. Consolidated net sales increased 1.4% to $2.17 billion due primarily to higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group. Acquisitions increased net sales 1% in the quarter, which was fully offset by unfavorable currency translation. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $53 million for the quarter to $962.9 million. Gross margin increased 180 basis points to 44.4% of sales from 42.6% in the first quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expense for the quarter increased $21 million over first quarter last year to $778.7 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 35.9% in the first quarter this year from 35.5% last year. Interest expense increased $5 million compared to the first quarter last year due to an increase in long-term debt to finance the Comex acquisition. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $26.1 million or 18.3% to $168.4 million. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter this year was 31% compared to 29.6% in the first quarter of 2012. For the full year 2013, we expect our effective tax rate will be in the low 30s compared to last year's rate of 30.4%. Consolidated net income increased $16 million to $116.2 million. Net income, as a percent of sales, was 5.4% compared to 4.7% in the first quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased to $1.11 per share from $0.95 per share in 2012.","Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2013 increased 4% to $1.17 billion from $1.12 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 3.2%. The increase in sales for the segment was due entirely to higher paint sales volumes across most market segments. Regionally in the first quarter, our Southwest division led all divisions, followed by Southeast division, Midwest division and Eastern division. Sales were positive in 3 of the 4 geographic divisions. Segment profit for the group increased 15.1% to $129.7 million in the quarter, as higher sales volumes and gross margin improvement more than offset higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 11.1% of sales from 10% in the first quarter last year.","Turning to our Consumer Group. Sales in the first quarter decreased 3.7% to $308.6 million due primarily to the previous disclosed elimination of some paint business with large retail customers that was partially offset by acquisitions. Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $1.3 million to $54 million in the quarter from $55.3 million in first quarter last year. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 17.5% from 17.3% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to continued tight expense control and operating efficiencies driven by volume growth in the Paint Stores Group.","For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 0.8% to $486.8 million in the quarter due primarily to selling price increases and acquisitions, mostly offset by unfavorable currency translation. In the quarter, acquisitions increased net sales by 1%, and unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased sales by the same amount. First quarter segment profit increased 18.5% to $33.9 million due primarily to higher selling prices and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by unfavorable currency and acquisitions. The combination of currency translation and acquisitions reduced segment profit by $1.8 million. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 7% from 5.9% in the same period last year.","For our Latin American Coatings Group. The first quarter net sales decreased 2.1 -- 2.9% to $202.6 million due to unfavorable currency translations that was partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 6.6% in the quarter. Stated in U.S. dollars, segment profit in the quarter increased to $20.8 million from $19.9 million last year. Good expense control and higher selling prices more than offset a $1.7 million drag from unfavorable currency translation in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 10.3% in the quarter compared to 9.5% in the first quarter of 2012.","Turning briefly to the balance sheet. Our total debt on March 31, 2013 was $1.7 billion, including short-term borrowings of $68.3 million. Total debt on March 31 last year was $1.32 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $613.9 million compared to $25.5 million at the end of first quarter 2012. In the first quarter of this year, we spent $31.2 million on capital expenditures, depreciation expense was $38.9 million and amortization expense was $7.7 million. For the full year 2013, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $130 million to $150 million, depreciation will be about $150 million and amortization will be about $30 million.","I'll conclude this review with a brief comment on the status of our lead litigation. The Santa Clara case involving claims and public nuisance brought by 10 cities and counties in California against 5 dependent companies continues to move forward. The judge presiding over the case has set the case for trial on June 24, 2013.","That concludes our review of the results for first quarter 2013. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. Chris?","Christopher M. Connor","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. There's been a lot of volatility in the market in recent weeks around U.S. housing and building materials, and it seems that every new data point is being dissected for clues about the durability of this recovery. While a few of the recent indicators appear to be heading in the wrong direction, most notably the NAHB builder sentiment index, as well as March single-family housing starts and residential permits, the majority of the data still points to a robust and sustainable recovery.","I think our sales results in the first quarter support that conclusion. Although our revenue growth was only 1.4%, keep in mind the 15.1% sales increase in first quarter 2012 was an extremely difficult comparison. Aside from the obvious difference in weather this year, the calendar was also a challenge. We lost the equivalent of 2 full business days in the quarter compared to last year, and Easter week fell in March this year versus April last year. Despite these expected headwinds, our consolidated revenue and volume were both positive.","The purest read we have in the health of the domestic market comes from our Paint Stores Group. With all the challenges we faced in Q1, our comp store sales grew more than 3%. If you look at interior paint sales versus exterior, you get an even better perspective on the difference between first quarter '12 and '13. Sales of interior products this year increased almost 10% on top of strong double-digit growth last year, while exterior sales were slightly better than flat. A relative softness in our exterior business was not only a drag in revenue and volume compared to last year but also on mix because exterior paint commands a higher average price per gallon and higher gross margin. This mix shift resulted in volume growth that was higher than revenue growth for the quarter.","Obviously, our Paint Stores Group wasn't the only segment affected by the weather and calendar. A loss of business days in the quarter reduced shipments across all segments of the company, and winter weather significantly affected demand for protected and marine products, as well as architectural. We commented on our first quarter call last year that unseasonably warm weather doesn't create demand for paint, it creates opportunity to paint. The good news this year is that normal seasonal cold and wet weather doesn't destroy demand for paint, it simply postpones it. And we are encouraged by the demand trends we've seen so far in the second quarter.","This was our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement, clear evidence of the progress we've made in containing raw material costs and recovering the gross margin erosion we experienced in 2010 and 2011. We expect this trend to continue, although the rate of improvement should diminish as we go through the year.","Based on what we saw during the first quarter, we've tempered our raw material cost outlook for the year. Industry average pricing for most of the key raw materials used in paint and coatings continues to moderate as TiO2 pricing has remained stable, and propylene, a key feedstock for resins, latex and solvents, has come off its February highs. We now believe average annual raw material cost for the industry will be flat with 2012 versus our January outlook of low single-digit inflation.","Our working capital, which we measure as inventories plus receivables minus payables, decreased as a percent of sales to 11.7% from 12.7% in the first quarter last year. The reduction in working capital, combined with the increase in net income in the quarter, more than offset the $80 million cash contribution we made through our ESOP plan to satisfy our agreement with the Department of Labor. Taking all this into account, net operating cash in the quarter increased by almost $64 million compared to first quarter last year.","During the quarter, we acquired 0.5 million shares of the company's stock for treasury, at an average cost of $162.88 per share, for a total investment of $81.4 million. On March 31, we had remaining authorization to acquire 15.95 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, up from $0.39 last year.","Our Paint Stores Group added 9 net new stores during the quarter, and our plan calls for full year store openings in the range of 70 to 80 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 3,529 locations compared to 3,455 1 year ago. This year-over-year increase in store locations, along with the investments we made in store and territory staffing in the back half of last year, resulted in a 40-basis-point increase in SG&A as a percent of sales in the quarter. As our revenue growth accelerates, our SG&A will decline as a percent of sales, and we expect to finish the year below the 2012 level of SG&A as a percent of sales.","We remain optimistic that U.S. architectural paint market volumes, primarily in the residential segments, will strengthen as we get into the prime painting season. Our outlook for second quarter 2013 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the range of 5% to 9% compared to last year second quarter. With sales of that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share compared to last year's record, $2.17 per share.","For the full year 2013, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2012 by a mid-single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are reaffirming our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $7.45 and $7.55 per share compared to last year.","Finally, I'd like to comment briefly on our progress on the Comex acquisition. We completed the regulatory review process in 2 of 3 countries. Although we remain confident that this transaction will close, it is impossible to predict the timing at this point. We remain hopeful that it'll be sometime in the second quarter. As you would expect, we are making productive use of this interim period to prepare our company for a seamless integration and a fast start once the transaction is complete. Until that time, I'm sure you respect the fact that we cannot disclose information about Comex operations, financial performance or additional details of the transaction.","Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. And now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Chris, the interior versus exterior paint demand differential that you pointed out, do you think the exterior's performance was a function of the tough comp from a year ago? Or is it just all the more unfavorable weather in March across the country?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, the answer is yes to both of those. I mean, that was the whole point. And we saw reasonable seasonal exterior sales gains in our Southern market, but it was the Northern markets that were painting outside last year that really saw a decline in exterior gallons. Take those 2 together, we delivered a flat exterior performance for the Stores Group.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then can you just kind of parse out what you're seeing residential versus commercial as best as you can tell?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think as we've been commenting for some time, it is the residential portions of this architectural market that are rebounding, both in the new construction, as well as in the repaint. Commercial tends to lag that. We've begun to see some lift in the commercial repaint as occupancy rates improve, not so much a lift yet in the new construction portion of that business.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just one final one on Global Finishes. For the second quarter last year, it was a very, very strong performance from a margin perspective, seems like a tough comp. Do you think margins will be up in Global Finishes year-over-year during the second quarter of '13?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, I think when -- we were pretty happy with the operating margins in Global Finishes. We've done some things to structurally help that business. And we don't give guidance by segment. But we were not surprised that Global Finishes operating margin improved this quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Aram Rubinson with Nomura Securities.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A couple questions. One, just housekeeping, if you can help us with the gross profit dollar growth you sometimes share with us by segment, would be great.","Sean P. Hennessy","Sure. I've got it right here. The Stores Group, the incremental gross profit dollars were $37,663,000; the Consumer, incremental $2,891,000; and the Global Finishes Group, $13,734,000. And then LACG was negative. It was dilutive $793,000.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","One or 2 other quick things, if I could. The 2-year volume trends underlying seem to be quite strong. If you did a 3 against what we had calculated as a 13, would put kind of the 2-year volume up near 16, and we had it about 8.9 in last quarter and 4 the quarter before that. Is that kind of a proper gauge of underlying momentum in the business?","Christopher M. Connor","I think you're directionally correct, Aram.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then the last thing is on SG&A. Last year, SG&A as a percent of sales by quarter, you did 35.5% in the first quarter and a 31.5% in the second quarter. You did about 20% more sales in the second quarter than the first. So my question is this, if your volumes in Q1 were to grow by 20% over 2-year period of time, why wouldn't their SG&A ultimately get to where your Q2 SG&A rate is today?","Sean P. Hennessy","Because what ends up happening is, is that our SG&A rate is a step function. And so to get that 20% sales volume that you speak of, we'll probably have more stores. We'll probably have more reps. We'll have more SG&A that will flatline itself against the quarters. If that occurs, you're going to see to get that 20% increase in the first quarter. Actually, you also get a second quarter pop also. So that sales curve really -- when -- that's why a lot of times when people ask, \"What's your fixed versus variable?\" We think the fixed is a lot higher because store manager, assistant manager, all those things are fixed, and that sales curve to get that 20%. Now if you're saying, structurally, we were able to get the 20% more without any additions in stores, reps or other things, then you would see it drive down, yes.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Yes. Because I noticed you're still running about a little less than 70%. Let's say, the SG&A growth divided by revenue growth is maybe a good function too.  Are you still trying to be in that kind of 55%, 57% kind of range?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you help decompose the same-store sales into price volume components?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, that's a pretty easy answer, Bob. There's absolutely no price in the comp store performance this year.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then what's your expectation, I think, Chris, you mentioned that none of the seasonal patterns or weather patterns alter underlying demand. So would you expect that in the Midwest and East, you're going to see a much better comp versus sort of the Southwest and Southeast in the second quarter?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, absolutely. And I think that's implied in our guidance for the quarter's revenue being up 5% to 9%. As you'd expect, our stores numbers will outpace that, and that will be a result of the Northern division also starting to participate in the same kind of robust rebound we're seeing in these residential markets across the whole country.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Then my last one, if I could quickly, on raw materials. Can you give us a sense for what the residence time is between, on the outside, us seeing a propylene price move up or down and when it might reveal itself on a cost of goods line? And then, secondly, you seem a little bit more -- less aggressive about what's happening in TiO2 prices than maybe we've seen in the market. Is there some reason you wouldn't be fully benefiting from the sell-off in those prices?","Robert J. Wells","Bob, this is Bob. Let me take the second part of the question first. TiO2 thus far this year -- I mean, it certainly came down in the back half last year. But thus far this year, it's been relatively stable. And you know there are at least 3 producers in the market right now with price increase announcements. So we mentioned that there was a fair amount of volatility or that there was a fair amount of stability in TiO2, but we do not necessarily believe that it goes down in the back half from here. Time will tell. On propylene, the rule of thumb that we've been using is that it takes about 90 days for a moving propylene to get fully into the raw material basket, much faster on the solvents side of the business than on the resins and packaging side. So 90 days, I think, is a pretty good rule of thumb to see that -- the moving propylene fully priced into the raw material basket.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And is it possible on quick spikes that you could actually miss that or no? What we saw in the first quarter?","Robert J. Wells","We'll see it on solvents. Whether a quick spike, up and back down, gets into the acrylic chain or into plastic packaging...","Christopher M. Connor","Maybe not.","Robert J. Wells","Maybe not.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The big boxes seem to want a piece of the contractor business. I think one of your competitor is starting a new program at Lowe's. Historically, these big boxes haven't had much success with contractors. So how do you see that playing out this time?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, P.J., I think we've long said that we have tremendous respect for these competitors. And they have compelling product lines and offerings and are continuing to see what we see in the market, which is that the shift towards a professional painting contractor is the primary purchase of architectural paint. I think we've been competing with these folks for over 27 years now, recognizing these same demographic trends. And the data results that we've shared with you and the entire investment community would indicate that painting contractors continue to remain remarkably loyal to the dedicated paint store channel. So it's incumbent upon us that are in that space to continue to enhance the product offering, the service, the reasons that have kept them loyal there. And we'll take on this next challenge as we have all the other ones over the past 20 years.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And I think you've gained share with homebuilders during the downturn. So as the new residential construction picks up, should we expect better volume growth from you compared to the industry?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you just give us what kind of share did you gain during the downturn?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think we've talked about just kind of the top 25 U.S. homeowners and what our relative position has been there as opposed to any strict share number. And as the industry went into their downturn, a lot of these large builders consolidated purchasing activities from regional offices into a consolidated office. And Sherwin was uniquely in a position with a national footprint to be able to service these folks, regardless of what part of the geography they're operating in. So as a result, we're proud to comment that well north of 20, the top 25 builders now are good Sherwin's customers, and quite a number of them are exclusive with us. So as they come back up, that's a much stronger position than we were in the last time we went through one of these housing rebounds.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And I just have a quick clarification question maybe for Sean. In this Consumer Group segment, you talk about loss of large retail customer. You've talked about Walmart business in the past that you lost. Is that the same continuing issue here?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. We continue to have a step-down function into the fourth quarter. It's affected us negatively. And again, in the first quarter, it affected us negatively.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But wasn't the initial Walmart business lost a couple of years ago and that should have anniversaried by now?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. But as we -- it was not a complete severing. What it was, was a discussion and a movement from DSCs [ph]. If you remember, we had the majority, there was other -- 2 other paint companies in there. Those other 2, they did go cold turkey on those, but on us, it was a lock. And now they have the majority. And we've got another step function that affected us in the fourth quarter for this year.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. Specifically, P.J., it's in the private label segment. So you're correct that the Glidden brand immediately replaced our brand. There's been this private label piece that's been a little less visible and is stepping down exactly Sean just took you through.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Nocella of RBC.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just want to circle back on your comment that you're encouraged by the demand trends in the second quarter. Is it to say your order books are strong for some of the bigger projects? Or is it a little more broad-based than that?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, it's more broad-based than that. And we don't typically have an order book per se. It's more the anecdotal evidence of the painting contractors that are in our stores. We get some future look at the types of products they're buying that are non-paint. So for example, we've always talked about spray equipment sales as being a good leading indicator of the confidence of painting contractors as they're heading into the paint season. Here again this year, on top of pretty robust numbers last year, our spray equipment sales are doing terrific. And we just are cognizant that these men and women have a lot of work lined up. They're hiring painters, they've got a full load ahead of them and a lot of confidence that this is going to be another repeat performance for a solid residential repaint year.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just on Comex, I appreciate the deal hasn't closed and you don't have the full financials yet. But can you just remind us of the accretion potential that you expect, and the trajectory to get there?","Sean P. Hennessy","Sure. What we said is we feel that the first 12 months will be accretive, slightly accretive because of the closing costs, the inventory write-up and some of the other GAAP requirements. And -- but then after that, we believe that if we close here in a relatively short period of time, we're looking at $1 accretion the first full year we own it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Chris, question on gross margin potential. I mean, you started off the year with some pretty strong gross margins, even though your exterior mix went against you. So do you think you can be on track to equal that 46% gross margin peak you had back in '09?","Christopher M. Connor","I think we've been talking about continuing to move towards that. I don't think we're getting guidance that we're going to be all the way back of north of 46%. 180 basis points improvement we're making right now in this quarter will start to moderate, as we did start to have some margin recovery in the back half of last year as well, too. So that might be a little high, but we'll be moving towards that number.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just a question on industry volumes. I mean, the DOC doesn't put their series out anymore, but you've talked about maybe getting to normalized of 700-million- to 750-million-gallon market number in the U.S. Where did we end last year? And what kind of market growth are you looking for this year?","Robert J. Wells","Don, this is Bob. The American Coatings Association put out an estimate of volumes for full year 2012 that was in the mid-3% range. Our estimate was closer to 3% flat. So somewhere in that range feels right. That would have put us in the 630-million- to 640-million-gallon range. So still, probably incremental 100 million gallons to come back to the market over some recovery time frame.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Chris, you affirmed the guidance range for the year of $7.45 to $7.55. And I'm wondering if your embedded assumptions therein for existing home sales and housing starts are any different today relative to what they would have been exiting the fourth quarter.","Christopher M. Connor","No, I don't think we've really changed that assumption or impact on our guidance. As we commented, in my opening comments, about kind of the numbers were kind of jumping all over the place, I think there's enough other weight in this business, primarily in the maintenance of these projects, that are really the key driver for us. So we're still confident that we've got the right market dynamics to deliver the numbers that we're projecting.","Robert J. Wells","The other thing, Kevin, if you look at housing starts over the course of 2012, they ramped up over the year so that the exit rate from that year was a pretty good indicator of where we were going to be at least at the start of the year in 2013. So we weren't operating blind.","Sean P. Hennessy","And Kevin, this is Sean. Many -- for the last few years, many years, we've never really changed guidance for the full year after the first quarter. Goes back to the other question, you look at the sales curve, I think that even last year up for the first quarter -- because it was so dramatic, we changed it slightly. But when you really take a look at it, we usually wait until after the second quarter, which is a large quarter for us.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Sean, to follow up, it sounds like your raw material forecast has improved relative to what it would have been. Is it the case that you're being relatively conservative in keeping the range the same since it is early in the year? Or rather, is it the case that there's some offsets that you're cognizant of that would equilibrate it back to flat?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, I think -- I wouldn't use the word conservative. I think, I mean you have to -- there's a lot of moving pieces in these forecasts, and there's a lot of ongoing volatility on the pricing of many key raw material input. So again, we'll have better visibility on the year for raw materials, as well as a lot of the other factors after the second quarter.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then final question, if I may, just to drill down a little bit more on your exterior coatings experience. If we were to lump together the Southwest and the Southeast, what would those exterior volumes look like relative to the Midwest and the East? Just trying to get a sense for what the magnitude of the variances there within the company, if there's anything you can share.","Christopher M. Connor","I would comment that we were down double digit in the Northern markets, and the Southern markets were a more normalized sales growth.","Operator","Our next question is from Nils Wallin of CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Just curious on the loss of the business at Walmart. When will this anniversary?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, I think that, again, as in all of our \u2013 Walmart's a great customer. We're in there. We're showing them different products. We hope it never -- hope it ends very soon. But I would tell you that with this change, each -- this year, I think that the last time you'll see the effect of the Walmart will be at the end of the third quarter. It did affect us in the fourth quarter. So this change in the distribution centers from us to the other supplier will anniversary in the third quarter.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And by losing this business, is there actually a benefit on the mix at all? I mean, is this a low-margin business? Are you -- I mean, you probably don't want to lose the volume, but maybe on a positive side, it may not be the best in terms of margin.","Robert J. Wells","You know what, when you look at the Consumer Group margin, it did help the gross margin percent. It definitely did not help the gross margin dollars. And if we had a choice, we'd rather have the dollars. But -- and it was good business. I mean, the -- you had another supplier who wanted it because of the price of the SG&A. And the operating margin was a nice business for us.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Great. And just finally on Global Finishes. It looks like over -- when you layer in the drag from ForEx, that the, obviously, margin improvement year-on-year has been quite strong. And you point to operating efficiencies. Is there -- can you drill down a little bit more? Is there some capacity rationalization? What's driving this improvement so much on the operating efficiency side?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, we talked last year, Nils, about the fact that after a fairly robust acquisition schedule over the past couple of years, that we were in the phase of really rationalizing, justifying the manufacturing distribution portion of that, particularly in Europe. And so there was some rightsizing of operations that we needed to address. So that's primarily behind us as we head into this calendar year. We've also commented a little bit about the pricing discipline that's been part of the company's operating mantra in North America, that we needed to get implemented in Europe. And we've seen that take place as well, too. So most of it's come from our European operations. We still have the opportunities ahead of us and some final little cleanups, both in Asia Pacific, as well as Europe. But pleased to see that this group is really on the right track. We've long said that we believe we can get this business into a double-digit return on sales operating margin performance, and they're making good strides toward that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Matt McGinley of ISI.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","On your guidance, you imply a pretty healthy step-up on the margin rates in the second quarter. It almost looks like it could be 2006- or 2007-type levels. Would you expect to continue to build that margin from a gross margin standpoint? Or would you leverage SG&A? And given the investment that you're making in the stores, what level of sales today do you think you need to leverage SG&A?","Robert J. Wells","I think that for the second quarter, where we are in the step function of the SG&A, I think you're right about the guidance. I think there's got to be efficiencies. And you can see the SG&A as a percent of sales show improvement. And I think going back to Chris' remarks by the end of the year, we believe that SG&A, we expect it to be lower as a percent of sales. So I think that tells you, being up 4\/10 in the first quarter, I think we have to have improvement in each of the following 3. Gross margin, same thing. Echoing Chris' remarks, we felt that gross margin will show improvement. So I think we're going to see it in both. So I think we're at volumes that we're going to see efficiency.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And I have one on Mexico as a market. Can you tell us a little bit about how the trends are in your stores in Mexico? Is that a better market generally than maybe the rest of Latin America or the U.S.? And from a timing standpoint, with this Comex deal, is there a certain date that if you can't close it by, it would not be accretive, where the math wouldn't work out on a current year basis?","Robert J. Wells","Matt, this is Bob. Let me handle the first half of that question, and that is just the overall market environment in Mexico. Mexico had a rough year in 2012 due to some foreclosure activity, but long term, it is going to be a very attractive market. The rate of household formation per capita is much higher than that of the U.S. It's a young market, with more than 40% of the population under the age of 34. And per capita income and GDP is growing. So from a construction and maintenance standpoint, Mexico is going to be a very attractive market. And our business in Mexico has been performing well.","Sean P. Hennessy","Right. And as we speak of Comex and our expectations [indiscernible] that's why we continue to use the word 12 months, not in the current year. We believe that it'll be slightly accretive in the first 12 months and -- but you're right, the first quarter is going to be dilutive. And as -- the later it goes, the less chance it'll be accretive from a calendar year 2013 because of the closing. And you're right, there is a date that we cross that it won't be there. So -- but instead of sharing that date, we'd rather wait until we can close so we can give you a lot more details.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ivan Marcuse of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Most of them have been answered. Just real quick on the Brazil market, your volumes are flat in Latin America. Have you seen -- there's an expectation that you're going to have the Olympics, World Cup, et cetera, and that you should see construction pick up. Have you seen any signs of that? And what's sort of your outlook for that business going forward?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, we're painting some stadiums in Brazil as we speak. So there's definitely work that's happening. I think, Brazil, by their own admission, would tell you that they're behind on their schedule of their construction projects. So there should be some acceleration as we get closer to the 2014 dates. The slowdown and softness in the Brazilian economy is much broader than just preparing for these games. So housing has been off a little bit, the construction has been off a little bit. I don't think that this administration has been as productive for the country's GDP as the previous one. And I know it was a concern of theirs. But here again, as Bob has commented, on the long-term prospects for Mexico, we remain bullish on the long-term prospects for Brazil as well and are continuing to strengthen our operations down there.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then last question. I know this is small, but is there -- do you have any business in Argentina? And is that impacting that segment at all?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, we do have business in Argentina. We've been in the country for over 80 years. Argentina has been a middle of the road performer in our Latin American operations, and I think they're doing fine.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","If you start taking a look at the rest of the year, Chris, how would you describe the need or lack thereof for pricing in the Paint Stores Group in the U.S.?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think to our comments about flat raw materials for the remainder of the year, that would typically be the environment that we hold pricing in. We've made no indications of our intention to the contrary. As you know, Chuck, our policy is always to let our customers know first. And shortly thereafter, we openly transcribe with the investment community. This date, we've got nothing to share with you.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","All right. With regard to industrial coatings markets, how would you describe those in the first quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think from the protective coatings, which -- are you talking about protective or more OEM?","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","More protective, but OEM, I would lump in with that question as well.","Christopher M. Connor","Okay, so I think we commented on protective coatings as a soft quarter for us, and most of that is related to bridge and highway painting activities that were delayed due to weather this year compared to last year. But as we commented on the exterior gallons struggling, that impacted this business segment as well. But the underlying requirement demand for these products and the maintenance environments which really can't be delayed, that looks pretty good to us. We expect that business to rebound and continue on through the year. And the OEM product finishing segments, which are embedded in the Global Finishes Group, particularly in North America, continue to do nicely. A little softness in the European market demand, driven by the general softness in that part of the world. But, again, overall, a pretty good story for us this year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Your administrative costs fell about $4 million or $5 million year-over-year in the quarter, and that was in spite of your interest costs for the quarter going up about $5 million. So your net administrative costs or your pure administrative costs look like they fell about $10 million. Why did -- in the quarter. Why did they do that? And what's your outlook for that line for the year?","Sean P. Hennessy","Jeff, as you know, when you look at that administrative, we've had -- over the last 2 to 3 years, we've had some major growth in that area. And we continue to talk about some of the projects, IT projects, other things that we were working on and investing in. And we see that -- we're still working on a few of those projects, but we're trying to complete some of these and look for some efficiencies. You're also right, when you look at the interest, I think that the core without Comex because of the $1 billion that we did borrow at around 2 -- a little over 2%. It's going to cost us to have interest rates -- interest expense of $20 million, $5 million a quarter. I think that the first quarter, there was a few things that were -- we started to see with this. But I think we're still going to see some improvement without interest but -- throughout the year but without the Comex acquisition occurring. But it won't be as dramatic as it was in the first quarter.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, everybody has different ideas about where paint raw materials will be. Yours are that they'll be flat for the year, and, I guess, mine are that they'll be lower for the year. If it turns out that I'm right, that is that raw materials are lower for the industry in general, do you think average paint prices in the consumer business will decrease or in the contractor business or that the contractor market generally will decrease? Or do you think that they would hold flat even in a declining raw material environment?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, Jeff, we hope you're right. And I would tell you that in past cycles like this, we've commented that we will see overall lower pricing, particularly on bid business where large projects -- when contractors are out bidding for that, they'll be giving competitive quotes, and we'll see folks go for gallon and market share enhancements. So as we have in past cycles, we would expect to see lower year-over-year pricing quoted on that type. And as a reminder, we think that represents about 20% of a typical demand of architectural products. The vast majority of our products, which we would call our typical shop account pricing, we've had a track record of being able to hang onto that pricing in that environment. So if that remains flat and the 20% dropped a little bit, you might see a little bit year-over-year deflationary pricing. On the consumer side of that, I don't know that we have as much insight into that or as much exposure to that, frankly, and have much beyond the comment on your analysis.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Roberts of UBS.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Could you update us a little bit on some of your initiatives, like Emerald? And you've now lapped yourself on HGTV. How are some of those programs going?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, we've been thrilled with both of those introductions, John. Thanks for asking. Emerald, at the very high end of our architectural product line, both on interior and exterior, not that it would ever be the primary mover of products, but it does set the bar, and we kind of get that mix shift up the chain as we talked about it in years past. So meeting company's expectations for gallon growth. And I would say that HGTV probably is doing even a little better than that. We've commented, I think, not so much in this call but past several calls, that our DIY performance inside that stores group has been outperforming the industry. We believe we've been gaining share slightly from a low base. And HGTV clearly is helping the company skew to a lower age customer group. We can see that in our demographics through our POS information we get. And all that just portends to a better future. We're introducing customers to the advantages of shopping in the specialty paint store earlier in the paint-buying career, and they tend to be loyal to that cycle. So HGTV has been a big win for the company.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then in your regional breakdown that you had, Bob, the Eastern region was mostly impacted by weather change. I assume like exterior was down a lot there. Was interior up in the Eastern region even though the total region was down?","Robert J. Wells","No, John, I don't know the answer to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Dan of Morgan Stanley.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First of all, just so we're all using the right number, can you tell us what interest expense you have for the full quarter that's in your guidance?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, I won't share the guidance, but I think our interest expense and, we have it on the P&L, it's right here on the \u2013 I'll tell you right \u2013 I've got it here. Our interest expense was $15,311,000. Last year, it was $10,337,000.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So that's a good run rate for the second quarter as well?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, fine. And my second question is on your -- it seemed like the cash drag in the quarter from building working capital in advance of the painting season is much less this quarter than it has been historically in prior years. Is that just reflective of lower raw material costs or more efficiency? Or what's explaining that? Or was it just something that's going to leak into the second quarter this year?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, I think that 2 years ago, we come in and then we built inventory in the first quarter 2011, much higher than we had in the past. And it dealt with raw material availability and so forth. In '12, we felt a little less pressure as far as availability, and we allowed -- we had a more normal build. And this year, I would say we've adjusted, and we feel pretty good about the efficiencies in our supply chain. And we feel pretty good. I don't think -- I think this is probably going to be more of the normal curve going forward.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Obviously, with the weather, it's hard to sift through the volumes in 1Q. But as you think about the full year '13 relative to '12 in terms of the architectural growth, you talked what the government and your sense of growth was last year. But I'm interested, as your customers, what your sense is over the growth rate of '13 relative to '12 for the industry and then your relative market share performance in '13 relative to '12.","Christopher M. Connor","Well, I would say, Eric, that the industry growth rate, as we commented, historically, should run in that 1% to 2% from architectural. And because we're below age here, we said that double that is a reasonable number to start with. So let's assume that the industry is going to have gallon growth in the 3% to 4% range and we've been comfortable saying that stores business can run in a 1.5x that pace, so our expectation would be that our gallons this year are going to be north of 5%.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","As you look at the first, call it, 4 months of the year, what are the plusses and minuses relative to that? What do you see that gives you sort of positive thinking about that and where you have concerns in regards to getting to that level of growth in 2013?","Christopher M. Connor","We don't have any concerns about getting to that gallons number in 2013 right now.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John McNulty of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","With regard to the SG&A jump that we saw year-over-year, which looked like it was about $20 million or so, how much of any of that is tied to preparing for Comex that might not be something that recurs going forward once you've actually closed on the acquisition?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, very small, less than $2.5 million, really, in the preparation of Comex. One of -- you're right, it was up around 21%. So less than -- probably around 10% of the growth was due to Comex.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then if we think about getting back to normal paint volumes in the industry in that kind of 700 million to 750 million gallons area, so that's about a 15% to 20% increase in the volumes from here, regardless of the time frame, but assuming we get there, how should we think about what your SG&A growth to get to that -- or to manage through that kind of level?","Sean P. Hennessy","I think -- and, again, used to be that we used to -- you would see the growth rate. And you can go back to 2002, 2007, see what it grew back in that time frame. And we used to have a dynamic. And I'm thinking that our SG&A used to grow at around 45% to 55% of sales increase.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Volumes or sales, like we were just kind of pulling price out of that?","Sean P. Hennessy","Sales.","Christopher M. Connor","Sales.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question. On your CapEx guidance of $130 million to $150 million, does any of that include the potential for at least some of the early changes in the Comex stores if -- assuming that you do any of them this year?","Robert J. Wells","No. We've kept our guidance -- all our guidance and reporting and so forth Comex-free so that when we do close in a lot of these numbers. And that's one of the numbers that will increase.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","I'll be quick. Just on the same-store sales number that you provided us, Chris, you mentioned the days issue year-over-year. Is that number adjusted 4 days when you guys reported to us?","Christopher M. Connor","No, that's actual.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. So you're talking about a couple of points higher if it were?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. This 3% -- a little over 3% comp store performance in the face of fewer days.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. Okay. And then when the Comex deal does close, how do you guys expect to communicate some of the numbers to us as far as -- and I guess aside from just updating guidance, is there a way that you're thinking about -- kind of talking about the business or the level of information that you expect to provide on the business to us?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, clearly, on the quarter call, immediately following the transaction, we'll be taking you through a great detail. Sean, do you want to add some color?","Sean P. Hennessy","We had planned, and if we would have closed before the financial community presentation, it would have been fantastic. We would have taken you through a few more things. There are different requirements when we have to show some of our numbers with the history. And we will -- at that time, you'll see 2012, if we owned it since January 1, 2012, and you'll see the quarters, as well as that year. So -- and then on an ongoing basis, I'm sure that we'll have some type of -- you'll see our sales with and without the acquisition, and we'll show you the EPS effect of that also.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","First of all, on the consumer part of the business, can you give us a little bit more detail between the acquisition component and the FX component -- or, I'm sorry, the price mix component?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, I'm sorry...","Christopher M. Connor","In consumer, Dmitry?","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. In consumer, you talked about acquisitions having an impact, and then you talked about volumes being down. So I'm just trying to figure out if you have any price mix movement. Or was it flat like it was for the Paint Store Group?","Sean P. Hennessy","I would tell you that we reported that division down 3.7%. Without the acquisition, we would have been down 8.6%. But I would tell you -- on pricing, I would tell you that you look at that, that it was pretty consistent with stores.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Secondly, in your global business, that it's now becoming a more profitable part of the operation and, obviously, that's probably where the most profit improvement in terms of kind of the magnitude in margin improvement opportunity that you have left. Can you talk about the geographic mix of that business right now between Europe, Asia and the Americas? And you talked about the continuing restructuring and some cost actions that you can take in Europe. So we're just -- I'm just trying to understand how relatively sized these businesses are.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. The United States North American component of that segment still exceeds more than 50% of the volume that we generate. Europe would be the second-largest continent of scale. And then Asia Pacific would be the third. And I would say that you kind of step down by half and half again as you go through that analysis.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So something like 30% and 15% or something like 30% and 20%, whatever it works out to be?","Christopher M. Connor","Correct. You're close.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Right. And then, finally, you talked about still having a couple of opportunities left to repurchase shares as far as shares outstanding. What's sort of your outlook on the pace of this share repurchase? You talked about dollar cost averaging and being fairly consistent, but your share count has gone up sequentially versus the fourth quarter. So is there an incentive to bring it back down to below 2012 levels?","Sean P. Hennessy","When you look at the absolute number, our share count is down. But as the selling -- as the price of our stock continues to go up, we have a dilutive effect on stock options. So over the course of the year, we're going to eliminate that. But we sort of got caught on the price of the stock and so forth. We really don't have -- so I think on a year-to-year basis, you'll see stock options not be dilutive. But I just think that the way the stock price went in the first quarter, it caught us after we were basically in a blackout. And -- but I will tell you, in general, our stock buyback went to the Comex acquisition, it's going to really be [ph] lower than it has been in the last decade on an annualized basis, but it will be enough to make sure that stock options are not dilutive.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of [indiscernible].","Unknown Analyst","I just had a quick question on the India market, where you've recently [indiscernible] business to the locals there. You showed [indiscernible] transaction and [indiscernible] behind that strategy in India. That's one of the emerging markets.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think we've commented that the company's strategy going forward is really to be focused on developing the architectural business in the Americas and supporting our industrial coatings businesses around the world. India was a small architectural business that we tiptoed into the country a number of years ago. We made some assumptions about the country's readiness for the type of quality architectural products that we manufacture. Those proved not to be accurate. So after a very short and a very small investment, we decided it was best to pull out and wait for a better day. And we executed a transaction with the Berger Paints company, and we're out of India at this point in time.","Operator","Our final question is from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates.","Richard O'Reilly","I might ask you to repeat yourself on something. But I want to go back to the 2-year trend. And I'm looking at the same stores up 3% versus 20%. That would imply some low double-digit growth rate, something greater than what you would think the market would have supported. What do you think your normal same-store growth should have been or will be if you can exclude all the noise that might be in there?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. When we talked, Richard, over a longer cycle of being able to provide guidance by these segments, we said that the Paint Store Group should be a relatively high single-digit revenue performer over the long cycle. And we build that by talking about some pricing, some new store addition, and then comp store performance, which tends to run kind of in the mid-single digits, 4%, 5% range. And we build the rest of that to get to the higher percent. So over a long cycle, when an industry's growing at 1% to 2%, we think this comp store business can grow at a 4% to 5% pace. So clearly, in this environment, when we're having a rebound, we would expect to outperform that. Two things are happening here, not only are the gallons coming back, as we've talked about on this call already, but the mix shift is going back towards the painting contractor, where it had been drifting back towards the DIY, primarily as the new construction markets come back onboard that tend to skew entirely to painting contractors. And that's a good trend for this comp store number as well.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the floor back to Bob Wells for closing comments.","Robert J. Wells","Thanks, Robert. I'd just like to close by reminding everyone that our annual financial community presentation is scheduled for Thursday, May 23, at our headquarters in Cleveland. The program, as usual, will consist of our customary morning presentation with questions and answers, followed by a reception and lunch. And regardless of the timing of the close of the Comex transaction, we intend to discuss more detail about the strategic fit of this acquisition, more about what the combined organization may look like and our previous experience integrating acquisitions of this type.

We're going to begin the call today with some prepared remarks by Chris Connor, our Chairman and CEO; and John Morikis, President and Chief Operating Officer.

Connor","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everybody. I want to begin by thanking you for accommodating our very late change in the scheduled time for this call. A long-tenured senior executive of our company and a good friend to all of us on this side of the line lost a 26-year-old son unexpectedly this week. This morning was our only opportunity to pay our respects to this fine family and participate in the memorial service, an opportunity we couldn't pass up. We thank you for your understanding and your willingness to alter your busy schedules to be with us on the call this afternoon.","With that, let me turn the call over to John to review our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. I'll be back after his comments to share a few thoughts of my own. John?","John G. Morikis","Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Looking back on 2014, 2 prominent themes stand out in my mind. The first is the continued strength of our operating results during the year, with record sales, record EBITDA, record net income and earnings per share. The second is that we accomplished these financial milestones while continuing to make prudent investments in our future. As a result, we're entering 2015 very well positioned to grow market share and deliver even stronger sales and earnings.","Our consolidated sales in the fourth quarter increased 4.6% to $2.57 billion, due primarily to higher paint sales volume through our Paint Stores Group. For the full year, sales increased 9.3% to $11.13 billion. Acquisitions had no effect on consolidated net sales growth in the quarter but increased sales approximately 3.1% in the full year.","Currency translation rate changes decreased consolidated net sales 2.3% in the quarter and 1.4% for the year. Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter increased to 47.4% of sales from 45.8% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in gross margin in the quarter was primarily due to improved fixed cost absorption from increased sales volumes, the TiO2 settlement detailed in our third quarter 10-Q and year-over-year progress from the Comex acquisition.","For the year, gross margin increased to 46.4% of sales from 45.3% of sales last year. The increase in gross margin for the year was primarily due to increased sales volumes, partially offset by acquisitions.","Selling, general and administrative expense in dollars increased $23.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter last year, but decreased as a percent of sales to 38.3% from 39.2% in the same quarter last year.","For the full year 2014, SG&A expense increased $355.3 million to $3.82 billion, an increase as a percent of sales to 34.3% from 34% in 2013. Incremental SG&A from acquisitions, new stores and customer service investments accounted for the majority of the SG&A increase in the year. Other general expense increased $28.2 million in the fourth quarter and $35 million for the year, due primarily to higher environmental accruals in both periods.","Interest expense for the quarter decreased $1.5 million to $15.4 million. For the year, interest expense was $64.2 million compared to $62.7 million in 2013. Profit before tax in the fourth quarter increased 26.6% to $188.9 million, and for the full year, increased 15.9% to $1.26 billion.","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter 2014 increased to 29.7% from 22.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the year, our effective tax rate was 31.2% compared to 30.7% in 2013. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and full year 2013 were favorably impacted by the integration of Comex stores and would have been 32.3% and 32.1%, respectively, without Comex. Consolidated net income for the quarter increased $16.6 million to $132.7 million. For the year, net income increased $113.3 million to $865.9 million.","Net income as a percent of sales in the quarter increased to 5.2% from 4.7% last year. For the year, net income as a percent of sales increased to 7.8% from 7.4% in 2013. Diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter 2014 increased to $1.37 from $1.14 per share in the fourth quarter 2013. For the year, diluted net income per common share increased 20.9% to $8.78 per share from $7.26 per share in 2013. Now let me take a few minutes to break down our performance by segment.","Sales by our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter 2014 increased 8% to $1.58 billion, thanks to higher paint sales volumes across all customer segments. For the year, net sales increased 14.2% to $6.85 billion. This full year sales increase was also driven by higher paint sales volumes across all customer segments, plus the Comex acquisition. The acquisition increased Paint Stores Group net sales 4.5% for the full year. Comparable store sales increased 7.5% in the quarter and 8.8% in the year.","Regionally, in the fourth quarter, our Southeastern division led all divisions, followed by Southwestern division, our Midwestern division and our Eastern division. Fourth quarter segment profit for the Paint Stores Group increased 46.9% to $247.5 million from $168.5 million in the fourth quarter last year, due primarily to higher year-over-year paint sales volumes and improved operating results from the acquired Comex stores.","For the full year, Paint Stores Group profit increased 21.3% to $1.2 billion from $990.5 million in 2013. The increase in segment profit for the year resulted from higher paint sales volumes that were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses and a loss from acquisitions. Acquisitions reduced full year segment profit by $32.3 million.","Segment profit margin for the fourth quarter increased to 15.6% from 11.5% last year. Profit margin for the full year 2014 increased to 17.5% from 16.5% in 2013.","Turning now to the Consumer Group. Fourth quarter external net sales increased 1.6% to $276.9 million, due primarily to higher volume sales for most of the group's retail customers. For the year, Consumer Group sales increased 5.9% to $1.42 billion, as a result of acquisitions and increased order volume for most of the group's retail customers.","Acquisitions increased net sales by 3.4% in the year. Segment profit for the fourth quarter decreased to $30.3 million from $36 million in fourth quarter 2013, primarily as a result of higher operating costs in advance of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams program rollout at Lowe's. For the year, segment profit increased 4.5% to $259.2 million from $242.1 million in 2013. This increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by the higher operating costs related to the Lowe's rollout.","Acquisitions had no significant impact on segment profit in the full year. Consumer Group segment profit as a percent of sales in the fourth quarter decreased 11% from 13 -- to 11% from 13.2% last year due to higher operating costs from the Lowe's program. For the year, segment profit margin decreased to 17.8% from 18% last year for much the same reason.","For the Global Finishes Group. Fourth quarter net sales in U.S. dollars increased 1.1% to $502.4 million, and for full year, sales decreased 3.8% to $2.08 billion, due primarily to selling price increases and higher paint sales volumes, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation.","Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 4.1% in the quarter and 1.6% in the year. Stated in U.S. dollars, Global Finishes Group segment profit in the fourth quarter increased to $39 million from $37.7 million last year. The increase in segment profit in the quarter resulted from increased operating efficiencies and higher year-over-year selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of $10.2 million. For the year, segment profit increased 17.9% to $201.1 million from $170.6 million last year.","This full year profit improvement resulted from increased operating efficiencies, selling price increases and a $6.3 million gain on the early termination of a customer agreement reported in the third quarter, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of $13.5 million. As a percent of net sales, Global Finishes Group's operating profit was 7.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 7.6% last year, and 9.7% for the year compared to 8.5% in 2013.","For our Latin America's Coatings Group. Net sales decreased 6.7% to $207.4 million in the fourth quarter and decreased 7.3% to $771.4 million for the full year, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation and lower volume sales, partially offset by higher year-over-year selling prices.","Currency translation decreased in U.S. dollars by 13.5% in the quarter and 12.3% in the year. Stated in U.S. dollars, Latin America Coatings Group segment profit in the quarter decreased to $13 million from $17.9 million last year, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation and lower volume sales, partially offset by selling price increases.","Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $4.9 million in the quarter. For the year, segment profit increased to $40.5 million from $38.6 million in 2013. As a reminder, in 2013 we incurred charges of $31.6 million to satisfy tax assessments in Brazil. Unfavorable currency translations decreased profit $15.7 million in the year. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 6.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 8.1% last year, and 5.2% for the year compared to 4.6% in 2013.","That concludes my review of our operating results in the fourth quarter and full year 2014, so let me turn the call back over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2015.","Christopher M. Connor","Thanks, John. It's a pleasure to add a few comments to the strong numbers John just walked you through. More than $11 billion in sales, an increase of almost $1 billion, consolidated gross margin above 46% for the first time ever, profit before tax that eclipsed $1.25 billion and EBITDA north of $1.5 billion. All that led to earnings per share up 21% in the year.","As John mentioned in his opening remarks, we also measure our success in 2014 by how well the company is positioned going into this year. We made great progress during the year on integration of the U.S. and Canadian Comex stores, the largest Paint Stores acquisition in our history. We stabilized sales volumes in these stores and significantly improved product assortment and product availability, all of which will result in a positive contribution to the Paint Stores Group operating profit in 2015.","During the year, we also realigned our Paint Stores Group and Latin American Coatings Group under a unified management team led by Jay Davisson. This move will enable us to share expertise between the 2 business units and better leverage our operating, technical and supply chain resources, which will benefit both organizations in the long run.","In December, we announced our first-ever architectural paint program in Lowe's stores nationwide under the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams brand. We're excited about this program, which will begin shipping in early spring, just in time for the start of the painting season.","In 2014, we generated more than $1 billion in net operating cash for the second consecutive year, thanks in part to the terrific working capital management by all of our operating segments.","In spite of a fourth quarter inventory build to support the HGTV HOME rollout at Lowe's, our working capital ratio dropped to 10.1% of sales from 10.5% last year. This improvement is further evidence of the progress our Paint Stores Group and global supply chain teams have made in integrating the Comex acquisition. We used this cash from operations, along with the excess cash on our balance sheet at the start of the year, to fund capital expenditures, expand our controlled distribution, raise our dividend and buy back shares for treasury.","Our capital expenditures in 2014 totaled $207.9 million. Depreciation for the year was $169.1 million, and amortization was $29.9 million.","In 2015, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $175 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending was higher than normal in 2014, and will be again in 2015 as we complete the conversion of Comex store locations to Sherwin-Williams. We expect CapEx to return to more normal levels beginning in 2016.","In December, our Paint Stores Group celebrated the opening of our 4,000th paint store. For the year, we exceeded our initial expectation of opening 80 to 90 new stores and finished the year with 95 net new locations and 4,003 total stores in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean. We remain confident that our goal of 5,000 locations in North America is realistic, and we intend to get closer to that goal by 100 to 110 stores this coming year.","During the past year, we hired more than 1,400 new college graduates into our management training program to bolster our store staffing, improve our territory coverage and fill our store management pipeline.","Although these investments tend to drive SG&A higher in the back half of the year, new stores and service employees pay for themselves over a very short period of time. At year-end, our total debt was $1.8 billion and cash on hand was $41 million compared to a cash balance of $745 million at the end of 2013.","In 2014, we've returned more than $1.7 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 1.6 million shares of the company stock for treasury, bringing our full year total to 6.93 million shares at an average cost of $214.97 per share, for a total investment of $1.49 billion.","At year-end, we have remaining authorization to acquire another 5.23 million shares. We paid $215 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends. 2014 marked our 36th consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a string we intend to continue. This year, at our February board meeting, we will recommend approval of an annual dividend of $2.68 per share, an increase of 22% over 2014.","Looking ahead to 2015, the paint and coatings demand in most domestic markets looks encouraging. Residential starts and turnover gained momentum in the fourth quarter, even in the oil patch areas of the South, which bodes well for the coming year. Contracts for new nonresidential square footage were up 7% year-over-year in 2014. And the pace of demand growth in segments such as office, hospitality, warehousing and apartment buildings remained strong.","Although the rate of growth in manufacturing activity slowed at year-end, December marked the 19th consecutive month of expansion, which should drive continued growth in demand for our industrial coatings.","Outside the United States, it appears likely that sluggish market conditions and currency devaluation in Europe as well as many Latin American countries will remain a challenge.","Our raw material basket has many moving parts. But in total, we believe we're likely to see stable to declining input costs for this year. The drop in the price of crude oil, if sustained, will no doubt have a positive impact on the petrochemical side of our raw material basket.","But these commodities will not necessarily move in a linear relationship with crude. High-grade chloride TiO2 pricing held steady over the back half of 2014, but soft order volumes and excess inventory suggest pricing should remain stable for the foreseeable future. Based on these factors, we would expect average year-over-year raw material cost inflation for the paint and coating industry to be down in the low single-digit range in 2015.","Our outlook for the first quarter 2015 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the mid-single-digits percentage range compared to last year's first quarter. With sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter will be in the range of $1.30 to $1.45 per share, compared to $1.14 per share earned in the first quarter of 2014.","Embedded in this guidance is our expectation that we will incur some onetime expenses related to the rollout of the HGTV HOME program at Lowe's stores. For the full year 2015, we expect net sales will increase in the high single-digit percentage range compared to full year 2014. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2015 will be in the range of $10.90 to $11.10 per share, compared to $8.78 in 2014.","Again, we'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First off on your sales guidance for '15 calling for a high single-digit increase. Comparisons in the Paint Stores Group get quite a bit more difficult as the year progresses, and then I think you have some headwinds from FX also. So first off, can you maybe parse out the various end-market drivers that will get you towards that sales growth level, starting with maybe your expectation for what gallonage growth will be in the U.S. for '15?","Robert J. Wells","Yes, Ghansham, it's Bob. As we've often said, to hit our guidance range for the full year at high single digits, Paint Stores Group would have to be at or above that level, and that is certainly our expectation. We believe that, that will outpace gallon growth in the domestic market by, again, probably close to a factor of 2x. We would expect low- to mid-single-digit growth in the market, probably slightly above the rate of growth in 2014, which we estimate to be more in like the 3.5% range. So it should pick up. Also embedded in the consolidated sales guidance is the impact from Lowe's, which we've said would be low single-digit lift on consolidated sales.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then in terms of the guidance increase versus your mid-December update, I guess, is that primarily due to the lower raw material costs that you are now forecasting?","Sean P. Hennessy","Good afternoon. This is Sean Hennessy. No, I would say that the raw materials, when you look at the $10.75 mid-point to $11 mid-point, it was mostly driven by raw materials. There was -- we also had a little more foreign currency. The sales went from 7 to 11 to high single digits, so they have a little more effect on foreign currency. But there were raws -- and there were other factors, but raws were a major part.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So I guess just maybe you can just give us an update on what you're hearing from your customers so far. I know it's still early in the year. But on the backlog side, contractors as well as maybe non-paint items within the stores.","John G. Morikis","I'd say that our customers are feeling pretty good about their future. Many of them are looking at bookings that they've said they've not seen in quite some time. And let's say, quarter-after-quarter here recently, it seems as though they're becoming more and more bullish. So I think it's looking very well through the lens of our customers. As far as the nonpaying sales, those are performing very well. We're seeing strong performance in our sundries and our spray equipment sales. And as you know, we use that -- sorry, we use that gauge of the spray equipment sales as a bit of an indicator for us as to the confidence of the contractors, so those bode well for us.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you have seen some, I guess, building backlogs there. And then is there any kind of difference between trends that you're seeing in res versus nonres, especially in the U.S.?","Robert J. Wells","In terms of the macro data that we're looking at, we're seeing nonres actually outpace res in starts for 2014. Going forward, we think that the housing activity should pick up, we'll see solid growth out of both of those segments. It's a little early to tell which one is going to grow better in 2015, but we would expect solid growth from both of them.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about your store concentration in some of the areas or states that, from a real estate perspective, might face some difficulties with the reduction in oil prices?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. So Vincent, our store concentration, we've shared that density map with the investment community. I think it's up on the website. You can pull it down and take a look at it. Obviously, you'll see Texas is a strong state for us, as is Oklahoma. Those are 2 markets where oil matters. I think in our comments we made the notion that even in the oil-rich states, we're seeing good demand for our products. The residential repaint activities, which are still not running at kind of a normalized level, we think will continue to carry through, even though there might be a little softness in some of these oil numbers. But as Bob has commented, it's a little bit early to see the full impact of that. But we're not expecting or anticipating any fall off on the kind of guidance we're giving for those reasons.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up. Year-over-year, with the winter we had last year versus what we had this year, is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of sort of comparisons, not knowing what the weather is going to be for the next several months, but is there anything we need to be thinking about there?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, if you're living in New York or Boston today, you need to be thinking about a snow shovel, I would imagine, and it's pretty ugly in Cleveland right now. So our comment on winter has been pretty consistent for the last several decades, is there are going to be pockets in our country that are going to have really ugly stretches here. We'll have stores that will be closed. We'll have customers that are unable to get out and do the amount of work that they had planned to do. But that's just kind of embedded in the fourth quarter and our expectations. We're blessed with an industry which really catches up well in the second and third quarter. So we're not giving any kind of indication that winter weather will ever have an impact here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan Chase.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When you look across your customer base, which parts of your customer base are more aggressive about trying to capture some of falling raw materials? And which parts of your customer base are less aggressive about trying to capture those lower values?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, so I think it's fair to say, Jeff, that all of our customers are smart businesspeople. They pay close attention. In the case of the professional painting contractors, their focus has primarily been on ensuring that they have enough labor to complete the strong demand that they have for their products right now. So we're holding pricing this year. We've made that announcement earlier that we were not raising prices. That activity has been well received by them. And we don't expect, as we have in the past, that these raw material fallbacks occasionally, like we're seeing right now, will impact our selling prices at all.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What about in the Consumer segment. Is -- are the attitude -- or are the attitudes of the retailers much different than the attitudes of the paint contractors?","Christopher M. Connor","We don't comment on any one specific customer in that segment, as you know, Jeff. And again, we would just -- would say the same thing. They're paying close attention. They want outstanding products and outstanding service at a fair value, and we're working hard to provide that every day.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Dan Jester on for P.J. So if I remember correctly, typically, your store openings have been back-end loaded throughout the year. But I think in early 2014, you had stated that you were going to try to maybe make it a little bit more even throughout the year, but in the end, it was still a little bit back-end loaded. So as we think about this 100 to 110 new stores this year, is it still going to be back-end loaded in 2015? Or any chance that it's going to be a little bit more even throughout the year?","John G. Morikis","Dan, I wish you could see the smile on my face. We try to level-load those every year, and we push hard to do that, and we'll be pushing again this year to do that. We've got a terrific real estate team and a good market out there. We're working hard to spread those out a little more evenly, but we'll get them in as best as we can in the right locations at a great price.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then on foreign exchange and Latin America specifically, it still looks like foreign exchange is going to be a big headwind going into the first half of 2015. So is there anything you can do to kind of accelerate improvement in that business? Or is that something we just have to wait out until currency moves in a better direction?","Sean P. Hennessy","I think that when it comes to improving our cash flows and doing hedges, we can do that on the balance sheet side and the cash flow side. But on the sales side, there's nowhere to run. I mean, when you start to see Mexico right now at 14x, 14.5x, and then last year, we're in about the 12.60, there's really nothing -- nowhere you can hide when it comes to sales. But we're doing everything we can to mitigate the cash flow. But in -- operationally, we continue to work on that and that's -- and I think when you see more of a flattening of the foreign currency, then you're going to be able to see the improvements there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A question around kind of each of your architectural competitors here in the U.S., so Masco, Valspar, PPG have all had a fairly sizable announcement around contractor business through one of the big boxes in, call it, the last 18 months or so, which seems to be a bigger push than we've seen historically. Do you see any difference in the way they're approaching that market where they may have more success than efforts like that have had in the past? Or is there a splintering of that contract or subsegment that may make them more likely to use the big boxes going forward?","John G. Morikis","Duffy, we've seen a number of initiatives over the years. And quite frankly, our focus is on really executing our strategy. We love our model. We love the relationships that we have. And we're continuing to build on what we believe are the right things. And most importantly is just understanding that customer and building a relationship and the products and services that they need, having the right people, the best people in the industry that are partners with those people. So I'm respectful of all of our competitors. I think they keep us honest. We're blessed to have good competitors. But we've got a lot of confidence in what we're doing, and we're going to continue to do it and try to get better every day.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then just 2 questions about the international market. One, with what happened in Mexico with Comex, has your existing business down there suffered at all from any of the maturations that happened around that, number one. And then two, just with where currencies have gone, would purchasing foreign assets be more attractive today than maybe it was a year ago for you guys?","Christopher M. Connor","So Duffy, on the Latin American business, we made the comment that in local currency, we actually generated sales gains, both in the quarter and for the year. And I think that the relative softness in that, while they were positive, they weren't robust, really speaks more to the broader economic environment in the big economies of Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Chile than perhaps any things that were happening in the industry. Those are the issues that we need to get on top of and address and fix going forward.","Sean P. Hennessy","And when you asked about the acquisitions, the way we do it is we look at after-tax discounted cash flows. If we can get our cash back operationally and it's a good business, we really don't worry about the instantaneous or the current exchange rate. And I'll tell you why. A lot of times when we go into these countries, we don't put our cash in there, we actually will borrow in local currency to create a natural hedge. We try to do that as much as possible, and let the operation pay that note off. So we're more interested in what we can do with that business and with the long-term business, not the instantaneous foreign exchange conversion rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC","So I wanted to ask you just on the math around inputs. So we know that your gross margins are 46%, which means that your cost of sales are 54%. If 85% of that is raw materials, that's about 45% of the house of revenues that's raws. I think you've said in the past that a 10-point move in oil is about a 1% change in the underlying inputs. So if we've got a 40% change in oil, I'm kind of getting about 150 basis point accretion to the total which would be over $1 in earnings. So I'm just wondering what I'm missing in the math or where we're reinvesting along the way.","Robert J. Wells","Aram, we mentioned when we cited that 10% versus the slightly less than 1% relationship between crude and our raw material basket, that, that was an older analysis. And what we've done is gone back and not just looked at the input -- or the impact of crude, but the impact of crude oil derivatives like propylene and ethylene. And propylene and ethylene are really the key inputs for the resin basket, which is about 40% of the raw material basket. And what we've found is that in broad terms, a 10% reduction in propylene would result in about -- I'm sorry, a $0.10 reduction in propylene would result in about a $0.015 decline in the price of a pound of latex, $0.015 to $0.02 decline. And the same relationship with a $0.10 decline in ethylene, you'd have about a $0.01 decline in the price of a pound of latex. So we've updated the guidance. It's not quite as sensitive to crude oil as it was when we did the last analysis. We also get some benefit in the alkyd resin basket and in solvents, so -- which would, too, would be roughly a 10% move in crude, would be a 0.2% move in the raw material basket from those 2 inputs. The point being, there's a lot of moving parts. It's just not quite as sensitive as it was when we did the old analysis, largely because we don't use as many petrochemical inputs as we used to.","Sean P. Hennessy","And Aram, when you talk about the dollar and you look at -- we move the guidance mid-point from $10.75 to $11, we had raw material goodness in the $10.75. We didn't have 0, and now what we're doing is putting 100% of it to get to $11. The $10.75, so when you look at $8.78 to the mid-point of $11, that's $2.22, over 25%, one of the largest increases we've ever put out here as a company. So the -- we weren't saying that 100% of the raw material goodness was taken up from $10.75 to $11. What we said is $10.75 to $11 was driven by the difference of what our view is of raw materials from December 12 until today.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC","And was that kind of flat to now down low singles? Was that the change?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, I don't think we're going to get to that detail of going from our guidance on December 12 until today to show you all the puts and takes in each one of the gross margin or SG&A or even conversion rates, foreign currency.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC","And my follow-up, if it's all right, is just in the Paint Stores Group. We tried to back out Comex just to see what the legacy stores were doing, and it looks like you guys are kind of pushing about 19% segment margins in the core Sherwin-Williams Paint Stores Group. And I just wasn't sure if that trajectory still had some legs to it or if you had designs on kind of capping that at some point. Any thoughts on that?","Sean P. Hennessy","No, we really don't have any ideas on capping it. And one of the things about it, what we've said, Aram, is with the larger the gallon gains, that more flow-through we're going to have. So we had a very good gallon year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Looking at the numbers, it looks like Comex was less dilutive. It looks like it was actually breakeven in the fourth quarter. And I think your previous guide, it kind of implied it was about a 10% -- or excuse me, $0.10 headwind. So I guess what came out better than expected? Was it just the costs weren't there? Or are the assets actually performing better that you thought? And I guess how should we be thinking about the Comex add as we look to '15 then?","Sean P. Hennessy","All right, John, we lost $0.10 in Comex in the fourth quarter. I think that the reason you might be looking at it that way is if you think about the comments that John made about the full year, Consumer was relatively flat. I think that you have to take a look at some of that losses, it was in the Consumer Group for some of the -- from some of the product lines that they've -- they acquired there. But in total, the company lost $0.10 a share, right on the forecast.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then just one last question. On the Lowe's ramp-up and the costs around that, do you recoup those or do you catch up on them at any point this year? Or is it more of a 2016 time frame, when you kind of get the margins in Consumer back to normal?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I would tell you this that, again, we're going to have expenses in all 4 quarters for Lowe's. We're going to have sales mostly in the last 3. We do catch up for the calendar year 2015. It's very, very slightly accretive. But it's -- really, 2016 is when we feel we'll see the lion's share of that accretion.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I think you spoke to this partially, but I was wondering if you could perhaps walk us through some of the macro assumptions that you're embedding in your 2015 EPS range of $10.90 to $11.10 in terms of perhaps existing home sales, starts, nonres and maybe most notably FX, where you're marking that?","Robert J. Wells","Yes, Kevin, we -- this is Bob again. We didn't really tie our guidance to any particular metric in existing home sales or starts. We start from the standpoint that 75% to 80% of the residential market -- paint sold into the residential market is used to repaint existing structures. Only part of that is sold by existing -- is driven by existing home turnover. We do think turnover will be higher in '15 than it was in '14. We certainly saw an upward inflection in existing home sales in the fourth quarter. And we think that bodes well for the coming year. We also saw that in starts, a little stronger new home sales and starts numbers later in the year. So we feel we have a lot of momentum going into 2015. Importantly, if you look at inventories of both new and existing homes, they are at 5.5 and 4.5 months' supply, respectively, which are well below where both of those metrics should be. So we have some catch-up on the inventory side in new homes. We think that as inventory comes into the market in existing homes, it's going to drive that -- drive sales stronger. And then in addition to that, there is the whole nonresidential piece which we see as picking up as well.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And presumably on the currency, you're just marking it recent days. Is that fair?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, I think when you take a look at it, especially the way currency really drove down in the fourth quarter, I think that we do -- our forecast is we're going to have a headwind, a significant headwind, especially in the first 3 quarters.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then a second one. I apologize if I missed this, but did you size the expenses in the quarter in Consumer related to the operating cost on HGTV HOME?","Sean P. Hennessy","No, we did not. Again, we're not going to do a P&L by customer or rank anything out to that finite when it comes to any one single customer.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","On SG&A, it grew a little bit more year-on-year than it has in the past. And just curious if this is sort of a new level to expect? Or do you expect the SG&A growth to sort of moderate in '15 and '16?","Sean P. Hennessy","Right. I think that this year, our SG&A was up 0.003%, really driven by Comex stores and the Comex acquisition. We were pretty upfront saying that, that was going to happen. As the integration continues to happen, we aren't -- we also did -- we've done some work -- we've been pretty public about some IT investments that we're making. But going forward, we see a reduction in our SG&A expense as a percent of sales.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Got it. And then just on LatAm, I'm noticing some, this year, some closures. And historically, Sherwin has, even in downturns, has sort of grown its store base. So curious as to -- is this a function of a different view on LatAm macro? Or is it rightsizing your asset base? Just why there's been a retrenchment in stores versus the normal Sherwin strategy to grow?","John G. Morikis","That's not our strategy. I'm not quite sure where you're getting the data closing...","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, we did have a couple of closings of some -- down in a few countries such as Brazil, but it was -- it had more to do with just what we're going to do in that local, very local market, not a strategy for other countries.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Chris, I think a quick and easy one, because most of the good questions have been taken. But have you guys noticed yet, detected any sense of enhanced or improved consumer-buying behavior in light of the sort of tax relief on fuel costs?","Christopher M. Connor","No, and we wouldn't see that in the fourth or first quarter, Bob. As you know, those are the slow quarters for the industry. We've seen pretty strong consumer purchasing throughout the year, driven by pent-up demand, better home values, all the other metrics that we've been talking about. When we get into the start of the spring painting season, if oil prices are still here and it costs a little less to fill up your car, maybe that will have a little bit of a lift impact as well, too. But regardless of that, we're giving guidance that we expect this to be a good year.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Sean, I think you'd said you're getting the expense burden for the HGTV and then most of the revenue benefit rolls in, starting in the second quarter. Do you actually get a sellthrough when you place that inventory? Or is it only as the retailer books the consumer sale?","Sean P. Hennessy","Right. I mean, when they'd have a sale and they reorder, then we definitely have a sale to them.","John G. Morikis","We book the sale when we ship to Lowe's.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So I really don't want to get too specific on that -- the load-in costs in the first quarter, but how should we think about the segment margin there, either relative to the fourth quarter or relative to year-over-year?","Sean P. Hennessy","I think that you're going to see our -- in the first quarter, our Consumer Group margin will be lower. And it'll be lower because of the load-in -- the costs that we have. For the full year, we think it's going to be -- as I've said, you're going to see very little effect of the Lowe's business being depressive on the margin for the Consumer Group.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And when you say lower, Sean, you're saying sequentially lower or year-over-year lower?","Sean P. Hennessy","Year-over-year, I'm sorry.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And Chris, it seems like other than maybe some -- some of the international uncertainty in currency, the domestic market, you feel pretty good about. Is there anything domestically that on the margin you see as a higher risk to the business or something that you're keeping a particularly close eye on?","Christopher M. Connor","I think Bob's taken you through a couple of the important end-market data points we look at. We've talked in this call, Dennis, for a number of years, about the lagging commercial or institutional construction market, which looks better to us heading into this year than it has for the last 7 years. We've commented on residential, and no one knows that better than you what that's potential will look like, and the existing home maintenance schedules look strong as well. And finally, just to piggyback on John's earlier comments about the anecdotal conversations we're having with our painters, who have got as book of business as strong as they've had in a while. So from a domestic architectural platform, 2015 should be a good year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Just one quick bookkeeping question, what's the tax rate guidance for 2015 as far us on the P&L, not -- the effective tax rate, not the cash tax?","Sean P. Hennessy","Right. The effective tax rate should be in that low 30s. We had a pretty good -- the last 2 years. And that's why in John's comments, he told you what the tax rate was. It was in the 32s without the Comex acquisition. We're going to be in that ballpark.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So about 32%, 33%, something like that. And you talked a little bit about Latin America and kind of how you're viewing things there. Can you talk -- I mean, I know Europe is not a big market for you yet, but I'm sure it's something that you look at carefully, both from an M&A perspective as well as the growth of the businesses that you do acquire over time. We've heard some companies talk about the second half of the year maybe being a little bit stronger on lower gas pricing and more money in the pocket of consumers, so to speak, and maybe a little bit more competitive industrial economy, given the deflation in both the currency and the crude oil. Sort of what's your view of the businesses, particularly in the industrial side of the Coatings business, where you're at in Europe, on that region for 2015?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Dmitry. So as you know, our exposure to Europe is almost entirely industrial coatings and weighted towards industrial wood finish coatings. A lot of those customers are manufacturing products that then get exported out of that region as well, too. So we've commented historically about our low share position. Despite some rougher economic environments, we expect to make progress, given that position. We've got good technology and a good team on the ground. We've worked hard to solidify and improve our operations. You've seen that in the global group margins. Coming up, a lot of that's been worked on Europe, and our expectations are that we'll have a positive growing year in Europe as well.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. One of the segments that has been sort of depressed for a long period of time, really, since the 2008, 2009 recession, and showed some signs of coming out in 2014, and I was just wondering what your outlook on that would be for 2015, was the marine and protective business. There is a couple of companies with exposure to it in the group of companies that I cover that's looked to be sounding a little bit more bullish about marine and protective, especially. You've grown through this downturn with your business. How do you view it going into 2015?","John G. Morikis","Well, I'd say it's going to be choppy, which is appropriate for a marine response, I suppose. But as we look forward, we play a niche market -- play in the niche market there. We kind of carve out our space. And again, just as we've described in other markets where our market share overall is lower, we've got plenty of opportunity to grow regardless of the market. So I think overall, there's going to be some ups and downs there, but we feel as though there is still opportunity for us to grow.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI, Research Division","I had a couple of follow-up questions, really getting to the Paint Stores Group. You mentioned, I think, volume for the industry you thought was up 3.5x and you were 2x that for the year. How did the fourth quarter play out in terms of volume versus mix and price?","Sean P. Hennessy","It was pretty -- I would say, it was very comparable to that. I mean, we saw -- the numbers were -- we're starting to see the Comex stores come into the comp stores in the fourth quarter. And you're seeing that. That was a little depressive. But in total, we still -- we sit there and feel that we were probably still growing twice the market in the fourth quarter.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI, Research Division","And is it fair then to say that there was a point or 2 of mix and price as well in that, that 7.5?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, yes. Yes.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Perfect. And then the second and I -- just a little bit of a housekeeping one. When you have the $0.16 share charge, does that include -- is that the net effect, including the titanium dioxide settlements? Or is that different from the $0.16?","Sean P. Hennessy","The $0.16...","Robert J. Wells","Well, it was $22 million for the titanium dioxide -- or I'm sorry. Pardon me.","Sean P. Hennessy","Right. Yes. When you -- I'm trying to remember where that $20 million -- when we had the titanium dioxide which was $21 million, we had to net that for taxes. So that's where the $0.16 comes from.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Got it. And then lastly, and at the risk of going back to this one more time, so I make sure I heard it clearly, the start-up costs for the HGTV Lowe's program was basically the only reason for the Consumer margin decline in the fourth quarter.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI, Research Division","And it sounds like you expect a similar pressure in the first quarter?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Could you, Sean, just repeat, to start off with, the 2015 CapEx number? I missed it before when you were giving us those numbers.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, in the $240 million. And again, that's really being driven by the refurbishment of the Comex stores.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Okay. Great. And then yes, my next question is about Comex. Sean, how do you expect their contribution in 2015 to phase into the quarterly earnings space? They lost some money in the fourth quarter. Are they suddenly profitable in the first? Or how do you see that shaping up?","Sean P. Hennessy","When we look at it, we talked about the $0.10 a share, I would say that we're looking that in the first and fourth quarter, we'll be slightly negative. And in the second and third quarter, we're going to make probably 10-plus in those 2 quarters. And I would say it's about even between the second and third quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","When I look at the Brazilian real last year, it actually rallied in the late spring and into the summer. Is the most difficult currency comp going to be in the second quarter? The fourth quarter was $0.09. Are we looking at materially above $0.09 when we get on to the second quarter this year?","Sean P. Hennessy","Right. When you were talking about the Brazilian real, if you look at it, it was in the 2.22, 2.23 to 1. That's really going to be the biggest hurdle for us in the year 2015. In the first quarter, it was closer to the 2.40. So the 2.65 versus 2.40. If it stays at 2.65, it's 2.65 versus that 2.22, 2.23 in the second quarter last year.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then the earlier question about low gasoline prices potentially stimulating consumer demand, I mean, the outdoor market is what seasonally picks up later in the year, which would be much less consumer that's there. The consumer market would be mostly indoor, and I would think you would see some signs of that here during the winter as well, if that was going to happen.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, that's accurate that the indoor market is -- or the interior paint market is more of a 12-month than the exterior one for sure. But if you look at our traditional sales bell curve, we're going to see, even in pickup and interior gallons in the second and third quarter. I think the reality is, is that we're having terrific gallon performance this year through those stores. So is the reaction because oil prices are lower or because people have more confidence and home values are up, it's just time to repaint? We're not smart enough to put our finger on exactly what it is. We're just out there working hard to get every one of those incremental gallons as we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","One question on Comex. Could you remind us of the earnings impact of that business in '14, and then '15 and '16? And you can frame it on an earnings or on a margin basis, but curious on where that is pacing. You also seemed to indicate that it's still comping below the core, and I'm curious on your expectation of how that would work its way through the system and what your outlook is for that.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, Eric. We lost $0.02 in the third quarter 2013. We lost $0.11 in the fourth quarter 2013. So we lost $0.13 in the calendar year 2013. This year, we lost $0.28, $0.10 of which was in the fourth quarter. So we lost $0.18 in the first 3 quarters. So really, when you look at that $0.11 in the fourth quarter of 2013, $0.10 this year, it was relatively flat. We've said that we're going to make $0.10. Now we have annualized this acquisition, and that's pretty much the amount of color that we're really going to give. I think as it becomes a higher degree of integration, it's harder to actually pinpoint the exact numbers. But to give you any more color around sales going forward in '16 or '17, we're just not going to be able to do it.","John G. Morikis","I think, Eric, as you know, our strategy moving forward, as they become a Sherwin-Williams store, those products are going to be available. Those customers are using those accounts already in different stores. So our strategy is to make that more of a customer-efficient store. And that means more Sherwin products available in any of the stores, including those that are acquired through Comex.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","I think that -- and that's helpful. I think the vision -- or in the past, the thinking was that it would get to a comparable margin as the stores grew up, an upper teens margin. It felt like that was kind of a '16 event. Is that still the way we should think about it? Or -- and I understand it's now consolidated within the business, but how we should we think about where the margin is going?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think that's a very good way to think about it. By '16, these stores will have been in our family now for 2.5, 3 years, and that's when they're running at a core level.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence.","Christopher Perrella","How many of the Comex stores are left to refurbish at this point? And how should I think about run rate CapEx next year...","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, we have about -- of the 306 we acquired, we have 294 still. That looks like a good number going forward. We had about 1\/3 of them converted this year. So just shy of 200 yet to go.","Christopher Perrella","All right. And what should CapEx be when it returns to normal, I guess, as a percent of sales in 2016?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, I think we've always run this company around 1.5%. I think that 1.5% to 2% is probably a pretty good long-term number.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates.","Richard O'Reilly","Talking about the consumer savings from lower fuel costs, would any of that show up in the Finishes Group? I'm thinking wood treatment cabinets, home appliances, would you see any of that?","Christopher M. Connor","Sure, if we were able to have the laser vision to see through the consumer's incentive for purchasing, if they felt a little more confident to make furniture purchases, to your point, floor covering purchases, expansions of their properties, all those things would have an impact in the coatings demand.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay. And second thing, I guess I'm confused about the Comex, because my press release says it lost $0.18 a share in 2014. And I guess I'm confused.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, that was the first 3 quarters. And I think in the press release, I remember the $0.18 also. I think that, that was an incremental $0.18. So when you were looking at that $0.28 versus last year, I guess it's because the share count changes. When I gave Eric the number of 2 plus 11, that was a 1 share count number. And this year, it was the $0.28 at a different share count. So the difference was $0.18 one year over the other.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay. Fine. So you had $0.28, okay, versus '13. Okay. Fine. But the press release uses an $0.18 number for the full year. Okay.","Sean P. Hennessy","Right.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Bob Wells for closing remarks.","Robert J. Wells","Thank you again, Roya. I'd like to wrap up today by asking you to save the date of Thursday, May 28, on your calendars. That's the day we'll host our Annual Financial Community Presentation this year at the Langham Hotel in Boston.

An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com beginning approximately 2 hours after this conference call concludes and will be available until Monday, November 17, 2014, 5:00 p.m. Eastern time.","Following the company's review of the third quarter financial results and outlook for the fourth quarter and full year, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Robert J. Wells","Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're going to begin the call this morning with some prepared remarks by John Morikis, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Connor, Chairman and CEO. Following their remarks, we will open the call to questions, and Sean Hennessy, our Chief Financial Officer; and Al Mistysyn, Vice President, Corporate Controller, are with us on the call to participate in the Q&A session.","Before I pass the microphone to John, let me remind you that this conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statements speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in our earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. In the interest of time, we have also provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website at www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations third quarter press release.","With that, let me turn the call over to John to review our performance for the quarter.","John G. Morikis","Thanks, Bob. Third quarter 2014 was another strong quarter for the company. But before we go through our results in more detail, I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight some key organizational changes we made during the past 3 months.","Let me begin by saying that none of these changes will affect the composition of our reportable segments for the third quarter or in future reporting periods.","For the past 4 years, Jay Davisson has provided outstanding leadership to our North American Paint Stores organization, overseeing a period of impressive growth and expansion. In August of this year, we broadened Jay's responsibilities to include the distribution of our products through Latin America. In this new capacity, Jay and his team will be charged with growing our business across North and South America, providing integrated resources to support our sales and marketing efforts. To support this effort, the R&D teams and labs located in Latin America region will become part of the global supply chain R&D organization. This will result in faster technology transfer and new product development across multiple product portfolios.","Pablo Garcia Casas, Formally President and General Manager of Sherwin-Williams Mexico, has been promoted to President and General Manager, Latin America division, reporting to Jay. Again, none of these organizational changes affect our reportable segments for our third quarter or in future periods, nor do they affect our leadership or organizational structure of the Paint Stores Group in North America. Our goal is to promote collaboration in the sharing of resources between our North American and Latin American business units to accelerate growth across both regions.","In the third quarter, we continued to see strong momentum in both of our domestic businesses -- in both our domestic businesses and mixed results from our nondomestic operations. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for our third quarter 2014 compared to third quarter 2013, then comment on each reportable segment.","Consolidated net sales increased 10.6% to $3.15 billion, driven primarily by strong performance in our stores group and acquisitions. The Comex acquisition added 3.3% to net sales in the quarter, while unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 0.7%. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $175 million year-over-year to $1.47 billion, and gross margin increased 120 basis points to 46.7% of sales from 45% in the third quarter last year. This was -- margin improvement was primarily the result of better operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume, which more than offset the anticipated gross margin drag from the stores acquired from Comex.","Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $94.7 million to $984.4 million. As a percent of sales, third quarter SG&A was flat year-over-year at 31.2%, reflecting a decline in core SG&A as a percent of sales, plus the incremental SG&A from acquisitions.","Interest expense for the quarter was $16 million, an increase of $631,000 over third quarter last year.","Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $86.6 million or 22.3% to $474 million. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter of this year was 31.2%, compared to 32.1% in the third quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low-30s compared to last year's rate of 30.7%. Consolidated net income increased $63.3 million or 24.1% to $326.2 million. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 10.4% compared to 9.2% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 31.4% to $3.35 per share, compared to $2.55 per share in the third quarter 2013. The combination of acquisitions and currency decreased earnings per share $0.04 in the quarter.","Now looking at our results by operating segment. Paint Stores Group turned in another strong performance in the third quarter. Segment sales increased 15% to $2.03 billion. And comparable store sales, sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, grew 9.6%. This comp store revenue growth includes almost no effective pricing and no contribution from the Comex stores. So core store volume growth was solidly in the high-single digits.","Acquisitions added $80.4 million or 4.6% to sales in the quarter. Regionally, in the third quarter, our Southwestern division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division and Eastern Division.","Paint Stores Group's segment profit for the quarter increased $72.5 million or 20.2% to $431.8 million. Segment profit as a percent of sales increased to 21.3% from 20.4% last year, as higher paint sales volumes were more than enough to overcome a $5.4 million loss on the acquired stores. During the quarter, we added 18 net new stores, bringing our year-to-date total to 51 new locations. At quarter end, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and Caribbean was 3,959, compared to 3,868 locations at the end of the third quarter 2013.","Our Paint Stores Group plans to add approximately 80 to 90 net new store locations during calendar year 2014. The integration of the stores we acquired from Comex a year ago is proceeding according to plan with some consolidation costs coming in below what we originally expected.","For our Consumer Group, organic sales growth slowed somewhat in the third quarter, but segment operating margins held up well. Sales increased 5% to $385.2 million from $366.8 million last year with acquisitions adding 3.9% to net sales in the quarter. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $5.9 million or 8.1% to $79 million from $73.1 million last year. Acquisitions decreased segment profit $1.9 million in the quarter, as a result of strong seasonality in some of the acquired businesses.","Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 20.5% from 19.9% in the same period last year. For the second consecutive quarter, Global Finishes Group generated revenue growth in the mid-single digits and made progress on operating margin. Third quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 5.7% to $536.3 million, driven by higher paint sales volumes and selling price increases.","Unfavorable currency translation decreased sales 0.4% in the quarter compared to last year. Global Finishes group's domestic business continued to show strength in the third quarter, but this improvement was partially offset by weakness outside of the U.S., particularly in Latin America. Segment profit, in U.S. dollars, increased 36.4% in the quarter to $60.8 million from $44.5 million last year, due primarily to higher paint sales volumes and price increases. These results also include a $6.3 million gain on the early termination of a customer agreement in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes reduced segment profit $900,000.","As a percent to net external sales, Global Finishes Group's segment profit was 11.3% in the quarter compared to 8.8% last year. Our Latin America Coatings Group continues to operate in a very challenging economic environment. Third quarter net sales for the group stated in U.S. dollars, decreased 4% to $200.4 million. Volumes in the quarter were negative and unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales by 7.8%, both of which were offset to some degree by selling price increases.","Segment profit in the third quarter, stated in U.S. dollars, increased to $11.8 million from a loss of $1 million in the same period last year. In the third quarter 2013, we incurred a charge of $19.8 million related to a Brazil tax assessment. This year, lower sales volumes, currency-related raw material cost inflation and unfavorable currency translation were only partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased segment profit $4 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 5.9% in the quarter, compared to negative 0.5% in the third quarter 2013.","This concludes our review of results for the quarter. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year. Chris?","Christopher M. Connor","Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. There is not much I need to add to John's comments on our third quarter results other than we remain convinced this positive momentum is sustainable. Regardless of the financial market's ongoing concerns over the resilience of the domestic housing recovery, if and when the nonres rebound will materialize or whether the job market can sustain all this, we see an increasingly positive picture developing for our company.","Home prices are still rising at a healthy yet manageable pace and mortgage availability has improved. At the same time, rates are dropping. Remodeling activity has picked up in terms of both current projects and contractor sentiment. New square footage growth is positive year-to-date in both the residential and nonresidential markets.","In cities across America, occupancy rates in multifamily housing, office space, hospitality, manufacturing and warehouses have reached very healthy levels, a really good bellwether of future demand for new commercial space. And many of the industrial coatings markets have turned the corner and are showing increasing strength. This positive momentum has been evident in our sales and earnings performance going back to the second quarter last year.","The results we released this morning set new all-time records for consolidated sales, operating margins, net income and earnings per share for any quarter in our company's history.","It was also a record quarter in terms of net operating cash generation. Working capital management continues to be a source of operating cash for the company, particularly as we integrate the operations of the Comex business we acquired 1 year ago. These efforts have driven our working capital ratio down 170 basis points year-over-year to 10.8% of sales, compared to 12.5% on September 30 last year. 9-month net operating cash increased more than $100 million compared to the same period last year and stands at just over 10% of sales. In the third quarter alone, we generated $550 million in net operating cash, bringing our 9 month total to $881.3 million. Free cash flow, which to us is net operating cash, less CapEx and dividends, was $583 million. We continue to invest a portion of the company's cash back into the business in the form of capital expenditures. For the first 9 months of 2014, we spent $136 million on CapEx, depreciation expense was $125.7 million and amortization expense was $22.6 million. For the full year 2014, we anticipate CapEx spending will be in the range of $170 million to $180 million. Depreciation will be about $170 million, and amortization will be about $30 million.","In the third quarter, we bought back 2 million shares of our common stock in the open market, bringing our year-to-date total purchases to 5.33 million shares at an average price of $2.05, I'm sorry, $205.46. On September 30, we have remaining authorization to acquire 6.8 million shares. Last week, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, up from $0.50 last year.","Before I turn to our expectations for the balance of the year, I want to comment briefly on the organization changes John highlighted at the beginning of the call. Needless to say, for the past 2 years, we've faced very difficult market conditions in Latin America.","Our management team and all of our people throughout the region responded with intelligence, hard work and determination. I'm pleased with their response, and confident in their future. The actions we've taken to promote closer collaboration between our North American and Latin American businesses is not a reaction to the current economic environment, rather it's an important step towards our long-term goal to be the market leader in architectural and protective coatings throughout the Americas.","For the fourth quarter, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase 6% to 8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. With revenues at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.40 per share, compared to $1.14 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013.","This guidance includes our expectation that the Comex acquisition will reduce diluted net income per common share by approximately $0.10 in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, we expect consolidated net sales to increase 9% to 11% compared to full year 2013.","With annual sales at that level, we have raised our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to a range of $8.70 to $8.80 per share, compared to $7.26 per share earned in 2013. This annual guidance includes $0.28 per share EPS dilution, which is lower than both our original full year expectation of $0.50 dilution and a revised second quarter expectation of $0.35 per share dilution from the Comex acquisition.","Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just first off on the customer termination you referenced for Global Finishes. Does that impact the top line at all going forward? And is the gain just specific to the third quarter or is there any sort of residual flow-through into 4Q as well?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, the fourth quarter, no. There's no residual into the fourth quarter. I would say there's going to be a small amount of residual sales decrease in the future, but not enough to be material.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of the comp store sales for Paint Stores going forward. I mean, obviously, you're starting to cycle through some very, very tough comparisons as you did in 3Q. Can you just, sort of, give us an early glimpse into what a realistic growth rate is for you versus the industry in 2015? I know it's a little bit early, but I thought I'd ask anyway.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Ghansham. So we'll give you a lot more color on that, obviously, when we have our year end call and give your our guidance for next year. I think we've been commenting for some time now to the investment community that our expectations is that stores group can perform at 1.5x to 2x the market based on the rebounding contractor segments that we've talked about. So if we think that the market will continue to be a little bit ahead of GDP growth next year, let's say, the 3% to 4%, we would expect our volumes in that stores group to outperform.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you -- it sounds like Comex continues to come in better than you expected. Do you have an update on when you expect the stores in total to become completely accretive rather than dilutive?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, we sure do. This is Sean Hennessy. And again, we're giving you guidance of $0.28 loss this year. And we've been consistent in the last few quarters saying that we're going to actually earn $0.08 to $0.13 next year. So we believe that next year, we're going to have $0.36 to $0.41 accretion. And we've given you EPS guidance there. So we think next year, we're going to have positive operating profits.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But you're not pulling that forward to slightly better performance in the last couple of quarters.","Sean P. Hennessy","No. And here's why. When you take a look at the difference between the $0.35 and the $0.28, this is really driven by -- it's really driven by closing costs. Closing costs have come in less than we thought. So operationally, we think we're pretty much in the same situation we were. The $0.06 that we did take this quarter, we did anticipate it in our full year guidance of $0.35. We did anticipate it in the fourth quarter, not the third quarter. But for the full year, we did anticipate that $0.06. So the difference between $0.35 and $0.28 is really closing costs.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC","A question on Comex about -- I know they're not in the same-store sales. But can you tell us about how those stores are performing on a year-over-year basis? I ask because seasonally it looks like your sales in Comex went down 22% from the second quarter, whereas your regular Sherwin stores went up 9%. And I just don't know why they behave so different on a seasonal basis.","John G. Morikis","Yes. So if you look at that performance over the past 12 months, we've had revenues through those stores of $425 million. And that is down slightly year-over-year. As we took that business over, those stores were under pressure, and they had sales that were going backwards. We've since stabilized that business, and we're feeling good about where that business is going, and we expect that those stores will perform much better going forward. We do expect that they'll lag our comp Sherwin stores in performance, but they'll continue to get better in their performance.","Sean P. Hennessy","We also believe that because as the integration continues to be completed, breaking the sales out and then going forward, really it's going to be a difficult, if that's possible. So this would probably be the last quarter that we're able to give you Comex sales. Because as the integration occurs, the sales go from one store to another.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC","But suffice to say that if your normal business drops off in Q3 to Q4, I assume we should expect that the Comex sales would also seasonally drop? And then I'll leave that one alone.","Sean P. Hennessy","Sure, of course.","John G. Morikis","Yes.","Christopher M. Connor","One point to add to the Comex story Aram, is that we've closed 7 Comex stores this year as well. Or the other side of the business, obviously, we continue to add stores.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then I'm sure the question will be asked. But oil prices have obviously gone through the floor and that must have had some change on your input price outlook. I'm just hoping you can update us and remind us again kind of what percent of your inputs are oil-based and how we should think about that for 2015?","Robert J. Wells","Yes, Aram this is Bob. It is certainly true that a portion of our raw material basket is sensitive to crude oil pricing. About 10 years ago, we did an analysis that told us that a 10% move in crude oil would result in just under a 1% move in the raw material basket. Since that time, we haven't updated that analysis. But since that time, our raw material basket has become less oil sensitive, primarily in the solvent category and resin category. So a 10% move in crude oil today would result in something less than 0.9% move into raw material basket. There will be some benefit, but it won't really be material.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Several companies that have reported so far have talked about signs of commercial growth. You have a pretty good exposure to that through your stores business. So what kind of opportunity do you see in 2015 from commercial construction?","Robert J. Wells","P.J., this is Bob again. We feel very good about the direction and kind of the momentum in the nonresidential market. And our optimism is fueled by 2 sources of information. One is the same published data sources that everyone else is looking at. And that shows contracts for new addition and major alterations up very significantly in a lot of the categories that Chris mentioned in his opening remarks. Office and bank buildings up more than 25%. Hotels and motels up almost 50% year-over-year. Manufacturing and schools and colleges in the mid-teens. And those categories, all told, represent almost 40% of the nonresidential space. There are some negative categories, retail and health care and managed care being kind of standing out amongst the negatives. But overall, square footage contracted year-to-date is up 5%. We also get timely robust feedback from our contractor customers. Many of them who specialize in this commercial space. And clearly, they are busier and more optimistic today than they were a year ago.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just quickly on M&A pipeline. Chris, you talked about in the past, making strategic acquisitions in Asia and Europe. And I know, at some point, you'd said that valuations were high in Asia. So what do you see there now?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think we've been consistent, P.J. Our interest in Asia and Europe would be to continuing the support our industrial coatings businesses, which we would embed in that global group. I don't think these evaluations particularly are out of line for us. Ours is just a much more thoughtful process at looking for the right technologies in the right end customer segments. Coupled with that will be our continued focus on architectural opportunities throughout the Americas. And obviously, in Latin America, plenty of opportunities. So we continue to stay diligent in those 2 areas and keep The Street posted whenever we have something to share with you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","With regard to cash flow, you pushed the working capital levels to some pretty aggressively really kind of squeezing a lot or wringing a lot out of rag. I guess, I'm wondering how much, now that we're kind of anniversary a lot of the Comex moves or initial moves, I guess, how should we think about the ability to wring more out of the working capital rag going forward?","Sean P. Hennessy","One of the things that we always are conscious of as we go through these inventory analysis, as we're looking at that service. And what's interesting is that service is actually higher today than it was when we were at 15%, 18% working capital. What we've said is we used just to talk about 11% of sales would be normal. I think our goal now is 10%. We think that will continue to work, especially some of the changes we've made in Latin America and so forth, we think that we can run this company at 10% working capital to sales and still have higher service to our customers.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. We don't like your word squeeze, John. It's basically [ph] running -- 15% is better.","John G. Morikis","I would say that the commercial teams are thrilled with the service levels and we're operating at a very good place right now.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then one last question. With regard to, I guess, the administrative line or the corporate line, there was a tick up on the provision for environmental. It jumped up $11 million. And so can you just remind us of what that is and how we should be thinking about that expense maybe going forward?","Sean P. Hennessy","Good question. If you look at our footnote that we've continued to put in our Q and the K, these are historical sites, manufacturing sites. And the ongoing expenses are booked when specific remediation plans are approved. And really trying to predict the timing that -- of the approvals with the government agencies is very difficult even while we're working with those agencies. So in the quarter, we have a little more agreement that what we're going to do in a site. And if you look at -- we talked about the Gibbsboro site in our footnote, and I think that's where we're at, and which is why the -- but this -- the work that we've done this quarter, that's why the expense was higher. And that was higher than we expected. That was probably $8 million to $10 million higher than expected. That was not in our guidance for the quarter. So we were surprised of the timing also John.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And that goes back down to normal now that we're -- now that it's been announced and it's kind of run through your channel, is that the right way to think about it?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. And if you look at it, our admin expense was negatively affected by $11 million in the quarter, $9 million year-to-date. So it's really that timing. It's definitely what some timing now.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","There's a new chloride-based large TiO2 plant being built in China or coming onstream in China from Henan Billions. Are you familiar with the technology in that plant? And is it feasible for Sherwin-Williams to import TiO2 from China that's chloride-based for its global operations?","Robert J. Wells","Jeff, this is Bob. We are familiar with that technology. We understand it to be not as productive a technology as some out there, but it's going to produce high-quality chloride TiO2. To the extent that, that chloride TiO2 comes on to the global market, we would certainly be in a position to negotiate.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Chris, I'm so surprised your letting Bob get away with a 10-year old analysis. Maybe just ask that question a little differently. If you put the whole basket together as you guys have done in the past, and everything holds where it is today, what would be your outlook over the next year, let's say, for raw material cost?","Christopher M. Connor","So Bob may be using 10-year-old analysis, but Hennessy uses a 148-year-old analysis. What we do here is based on history. It's a little bit early for us, Dennis, to give you comment on the basket of raws for 2015. Again, that will be a first quarter call. We hold ourselves to that discipline to advise you of that. Having said that, and with the earlier question from Aram about oil, we don't see a lot of pressure right now, but we'll give you much more definitive answer on that here in the next call.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay, fair enough. And then, John, just to clarify the accretion from Comex next year, the $0.08 to $0.13, are there any onetime items? Or is there [indiscernible] that will be included in that?","Sean P. Hennessy","No. I think that when we acquired this asset, we had 8 manufacturing sites. We've announced 5 have closed. And so we've taken the closing costs on those 5, I don't see any major changes in the next -- or hit in that analysis of $0.08 to $0.13.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then last question on the balance sheet. If you were not to find another acquisition over the next year, let's say that meets your criteria and the cash flow is going to remain strong, would you ever consider borrowing and levering up a little bit to accelerate share repurchases?","Sean P. Hennessy","I think we've been pretty consistent on this for greater than 10 years, David, at all 148. But we still believe that if we generate this cash, we're going to pay out dividends, invest in the business in CapEx and void of acquisitions, we think our debt's going to be in very good shape in that 1:1 in EBITDA. You'll see us buyback stock. I don't believe until we believe -- until we get the idea that we're not in a consolidating industry and things cannot happen. That's when we'll start thinking differently about that 1:1. But I don't see that happening in the next year's calendar year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Sean, can you give me the changes in gross profit for the segments?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, I can. Paint Stores Group was an increase of $137.8 million. Consumer was an increase of $14.6 million. Global Finishes Group was $14.5 million. And Latin America was up $9.8 million. And just remember now, Latin America, that's where the hit from the raw material -- issue in Brazil last year hit. That's why it's up.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then if you look at your Latin America arm [ph] division and I know you're changing, you're making some leadership changes there. Is your strategy in that region going to change? Or is it going to -- what sort of, I guess, Jay is supposed to -- what is he deemed to do besides improve it? How is he going to go about getting that sort of the margins reversing out or gaining more share than what's been gained over the past couple of years?","John G. Morikis","Yes. I think it's fair to say that we built a pretty strong franchise here in North America and then we believe that these skills and expertise can and should be leveraged throughout the Americas. And so our long-term thoughts and commitments in the region haven't changed, we do believe that we can drive those margins into that 12% range. And it's going to be up to that team to really get into those markets with the local leadership, understand what's the best route to markets and leverage all the resources that we have to reach that type of a good return.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then last question. Was there any price mix of any consequence that was impacting the top line for the stores group?","Sean P. Hennessy","No.","Christopher M. Connor","No, mostly volume.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Perrella with Bloomberg.","Christopher Perrella - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the Latin American strategy there. When the downturn came in North American Paint Stores, you continued to invest. I see the LatAm stores are flattish for a while now. Is the impetus now to start to build up the stores await the recovery?","John G. Morikis","Well, we are committed to that region, but we're -- and we're also committed to the right strategy in region. And so, as you look by country, we'll be deciding what the best channel would be. And in some cases, it will be our stores. In others, it'll be through other channels of distribution. And the team is working very aggressively right now with the teams on the ground to assess those and we'll be going full throttle once they've defined the strategy by micromarket.","Christopher Perrella - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. And a question, the price of oil and, I guess, gas on your distribution network, is there a benefit? Or how should we think about lower gas prices for the Consumer Group and I guess, the distribution network?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I think that -- we do buy a lot of gas and when we have a lot of shipping and so forth, we'll see what that effect is. I don't really have a metric that I can give you at this time.","Christopher M. Connor","Here's one to think about, Chris. We talked about what it costs to get a gallon of paint delivered to shelf, 85% of that cost is raw material. You've got the variable, manufacturing cost. Fuel and transportation is a small percentage of what's left. So fuel savings on the fleet will be de minimis in the impact in earnings for us.","Operator","We'll move on to our next question, which is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Chris, I'm wondering if you guys have ever looked at econometric models around oil price and is there expected to be any elasticity of demand for your products as consumers get a little more fat in their wallets?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I think the other metrics that we've been talking about, Bob,that are driving demand for our products are a lot more powerful than that. The occupancy rates that Bob referred to in the various end segments, our consumer confidence. Does oil impact that a little bit, perhaps slightly. But we would not put a lot of weight on oil prices changing the curve or demand for paint in the United States.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And given -- it sounds there is about that the relatively limited influence of oil prices on your costs. Does it have any influence on your efforts on pricing? Or do you view those as relatively independent?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. Well, it'd be just one of the many raw material input costs that go into the entire basket. We've been very clear that we price based on raw material input costs. So we've yet to make the call for next year on what the remainder of those items might be. But for right now, it seems that oil will not be a pressure point for us.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I've got a couple of questions. Maybe a follow-up on the last one. Could you remind us, looking at history, how that price mix plays out when oil prices or raw material costs are coming down? And then I have a follow-up.","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, I think if you take a look at that chart that we showed you, the long-term chart of our gross margin, I believe 2006, oil went up to $140. It came back down into the $75 range. I could be wrong on that. But our gross margin the following year, even though the market was decreasing, we held that price and we hit an all-time high at that point, 46% gross margin.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right, the gross margin went up, but what happened with the price mix per gallon? Will that come in? Or is there a lag or, how do we think of that?","Sean P. Hennessy","I would tell you that the oil going down did not have effect on the price mix.","Christopher M. Connor","Again, Greg, we've talked about the price mix ratio here for us has been to continue to see a demand for better quality products as labor costs continue to escalate, and that's a biggest part of this particular job. So I'm not trying to be obtuse here. That just isn't much impact on the oil price just dramatically on the way our customers act or the operating margins you're going to see for the company.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then the second question was on -- I think in the second quarter, you called out sprayer sales, that sort of stepped up to a new good level. Do you have any update on that? Has it stayed there or...","John G. Morikis","Yes. I think, be safe to say that they've continued at a pretty good pace.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then housekeeping one, the admin expenses, I see popped up to $109 million, up around $20 million. Was that a onetime step up, Sean? Or do we expect this level going forward or how should we think about that?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. When you look at the third quarter, I think and you're right, it was up $20.8 million. And that's where the $11 million from that environmental -- that hit that was not in our guidance. So secondly was just a -- the other piece of it was higher compensation, including stock-based comp, which was up about 10. And again, that's just timing. We knew about that, but it was really that environmental that drove half of that increase in the quarter.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So fair to say $100 million would have been like the normal.","Sean P. Hennessy","More normal.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","More normal?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, right.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I know there's no changes to the Latin American reporting, but it sounds like it paves the way for potentially collapsing the Latin American segment and the Paint Store segments into a sort of a Pan regional segment, much like you have in the global segment. Would that make sense and provide some cost savings or why doesn't it make sense?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes.","Christopher M. Connor","Well, how we report the segments in this particular case is historical. And I think there's very difference to those markets, so we want to continue to give that visibility to that. John made the comment about a lot of the learning and skill base programming we operate in North America, which will be moving into Latin America, that's just for those markets. So we're going to continue to run the company as efficiently as we can with an eye towards driving the most growth and share gains. And we think this is the structure that's best going to serve that. No change intended to the reporting segments for now or the short-term future.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Do you care to provide an update on how U.S. architectural gallonage is trending for this year? I think, back at your Investor Day in May, you put forth a new normal level of 760 million gallons. Just trying to get a sense of how far below that we're tracking in 2014.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, we don't have good data anymore. Kevin, as you know, on that. Our expectation or sense is that through the first half of the year, we thought the market was moving at about a 3% to 4% range. Just listening to some of our other competitor's results, it may be slowing a little bit to that. Last year's gallons were 700 million with a 3% pop. If you look at 721 million gallons, so you still have 40 million below that 760 million. Hopefully, we'll have a little better data to share with you on the first quarter call what the year came in now in gallons.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful, I appreciate it. And then, as a follow-up, could you comment on how your auto refinish coating sales trended relative to the Global Finishes segment as a whole?","John G. Morikis","In the Global Finishes Group, the strongest performing markets there were Product Finishes and Protective Marine. Automotive would have been in third position there. Domestically, they were stronger than they were internationally.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I guess, just a little bit on the Paint Stores Group. I mean, you guys have been trending up in the high-single digits now for several quarters. Maybe you can just help me understand why you think that should continue at that 1.5x to 2x the industry level.","Allen J. Mistysyn","The strategy that we have in our stores with this direct model is to get very close to these customers, build the products and services that they need. We're very aggressive in understanding the customers' need individually. And since we compete on a local basis, we have these local teams that are getting closer and closer to these customers. We're not waiting for the market to come to us, we're going to the market. And we feel as though we've got the products and services that are helping us to grow share at a faster rate than the market.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And I guess, just as the way to put that in context, I mean, relative to that 740 to 760 peak gallonage number, you're only at 700 maybe in the industry. So that is it fair to assume that your share has grown by significant measures since then?","Allen J. Mistysyn","Yes.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And that's just because of the -- largely because of the customer base, I guess, is what you're saying?","Allen J. Mistysyn","Yes, I believe so. I think we're aiming at the right targets with the compelling offer and service to provide them.","Christopher M. Connor","One of the charts we've used in our deck frequently, talks about where these gallons will come from as the industry moves from 700 back up to a normalized run rate. And it's going to come in the areas that are depressed and not quite there yet. New home construction, commercial construction, each tend to be very heavily skewed towards the painting contractors as opposed to any DIY participation in the rebound. And to John's point, that's where we really built the model through the Stores Group to support that customer segment. So we would expect to outperform on the rebounding portion of the gallons, just given our share position against our contractor today.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I'm sorry, just to fully understand this. So yes, I've seen those charts of the new home sales coming back, and we did have a pretty good number earlier this week or last week on new home sales for September. Existing was good. So you think you can still deliver this kind of high-single digit range even with new home sales? I guess, kind of still only in a recovery stage or...","Christopher M. Connor","We will give you guidance on the first quarter call. But to your point, we've sustained this now for multiple quarters over a couple of years. And we're still kind of -- to use -- since we're in the World Series time, a baseball vernacular, this recovery feels like it's the bottom of the third or fourth inning to us right now. So there's a little bit of a runway yet here. And we think we're in good position to capitalize on it.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Most of my questions have been answered, but I'd like to follow-up on a couple of things. First of all, back in your Investor Day, you've given the presentation on the Consumer Group, there were some hints that you guys are working on some programs. Perhaps, to get into various distribution channels. Is there any updates there? Should we be expecting something from the Consumer Group besides the programs that you already have and the products that you already supplied to various distribution channels?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, here again, Dmitry, we've been very consistent on this messaging point with the investment community. We've been working on expanding our Consumer Group business forever. And we've always been clear that we are willing to sell into these channels with the great platform of brands we have. The real opportunity would be on our architectural paint program in one of the big box players. And we just have been clear about our unwillingness to put the Sherwin-Williams contractor program brands into those platforms. But fairly now we've always believe we have an awful lot to offer. So those efforts continue as they have for some period of time. And if anything ever changes, you'll be among the first to know.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","All right, fair enough. Just a follow-up on the Consumer Group. How much of the either percentage of sales, or if you can just sort of ballpark for us sort of the size of the business, how much of that business goes into the independent retail channel? In other words, the stores that are not owned by companies and not DIY, but independent paint stores.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. So all the sales in that segment are external sales, that doesn't go through any of our stores. There are some industrial coatings businesses in the aerosols, for example, that we would sell to the MRO industry. But I'm going to just guess that we're probably talking about a solid 80% of it is going into the traditional home improvement retailing channels.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","I understand that. But my question was specifically on the independent paint store channel.","Christopher M. Connor","A very small portion of that.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A small portion? Okay. And then, finally, can you provide any updates, if there are any, on the what's going on with the California lead decision and where you stand on appeals and sort of what you're doing right now?","Robert J. Wells","Yes. Dmitry, as you know, the judgment was centered against 3 of the defendant companies in the first quarter of this year. We have filed an appeal, and we filed our appeal briefs on September 16. We are now awaiting the plaintiff's response to those briefs. And once filed, we will have an opportunity to prepare responses to their briefs. And the short story is that we expect briefing to go on until year end or maybe even into first quarter '15 following which the court will schedule oral arguments. And we believe the court is likely to take through 2015 or more likely into '16 to render a decision. At that point, we believe the loser will appeal to the California Supreme Court, which is likely to take another 2 years plus.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So nothing to worry about as far as cash outlays in the major way until we get to the end of the decade at least?","Robert J. Wells","We have years to resolve this, yes.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","And then just -- I'm sorry to keep revisiting this unpleasantness. But any updates on the cross suits that you and Comex owners have filed against each other?","Robert J. Wells","Yes, our lawsuit in the State of New York has been stayed indefinitely, but the arbitration process is ongoing. And the timing of the arbitration is uncertain, but it is moving forward.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates.","Richard O'Reilly","A couple of quick questions. When I -- when we look at the Consumer Group, the absolute profit went up $6 million or so for the quarter. But I'm surprised it's the increase in Paint Sales Stores was $250 million and the inter-segment sales for the Consumer Group was $110 million, up $110 million. I just would have thought more of a flow-through to the bottom line for the Consumer Group than the $6 million. Am I missing something there?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, the only thing you're missing is that we also had a $1.9 million loss in the Consumer Group related to the Comex acquisition. And so -- with your number, when you take a look at it, the flow-through of -- on the internal sales will change from quarter-to-quarter due to sales mix, but I think that's the only thing you're missing, quite honestly.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay. It's nothing out of the what should be -- or what would be normal for that size of the -- for the growth in retail sales?","Sean P. Hennessy","Right.","Richard O'Reilly","Right. Okay. Okay. Second question is, in Latin America, you talked about increasing raw material cost. What is -- what's increasing in Latin America that's not going up in North America?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. Actually, nothing. But Latin America buys the majority of its raw materials in U.S. dollar denominations and sells the finished goods in local currency. So that devaluation is been a pretty good headwind for us in South America -- Latin America.","Operator","We do have a follow-up question coming from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So with regard to the Comex stores, I believe you'd indicated on prior calls that you were looking for margins to be kind of in the upper-single digits in 2015. Is that still the case? And if not, can you give us an update just to how to think about that?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. And John what we tried to do because we were sort of mixing apples and oranges. And what happened there was we'd given EPS guidance for 2014. And that's why we switched the metric to the EPS for 2015, the $0.08 to $0.13 positive or $0.36 to $0.41 improvement. Operating margins are going to be positive. What happened was we originally gave a 60% of current stores, when our stores were in the 14% range. And then our stores jumped to 16%, and we're not going to be at 60% of that. And again, we're going to have margin improvement. And so that metric didn't work anymore. So we still feel pretty good about the operating margins. If you back out -- if you go up from $0.08 to $0.13, it's going to show you that we're going to have to be in the mid-single digits operating margins in the stores to hit that number.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional or concluding comments.","Robert J. Wells","Thanks, again, Jesse.

I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.","Robert J. Wells","Thanks, Jesse. As usual, in order to allow more time for questions, we've provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at sherwin.com under Investor Relations Third Quarter Press Release. Summarizing overall company performance for the third quarter 2012 versus third quarter 2011, consolidated net sales increased 4.8% to $2.6 billion, due primarily to higher paint sales volumes in our Paint Stores group and selling price increases. Acquisitions increased consolidated net sales approximately 1% in the quarter, and unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased net sales 2.2%. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $112 million to $1.15 billion. Gross margin increased 240 basis points to 44.2% of sales from 41.8% in the third quarter last year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher year-over-year selling prices, improved fixed cost absorption from increased sales volumes and slight sales mix benefit.","Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 5.2% to $799.8 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 30.7% in the third quarter this year, from 30.6% last year. Interest expense was essentially flat at $10.4 million. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $82.7 million or 31.8% to $343 million. Profit before tax as a percent of sales increased to 13.2% from 10.5% last year.","Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.5%, compared to 30.9% in the third quarter of 2011. For the full year 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30% range.","Consolidated net income increased $55.1 million to $235 million compared to $179.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 9% from 7.2% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 31% to $2.24 per share from $1.71 per share in 2011. Unfavorable currency translation decreased diluted net income per common share $0.05 in the quarter. Acquisitions had no significant impact on earnings per share.","Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores group in the third quarter increased 9.6% to $1.55 billion. Higher paint sales volumes across all end market segments and selling price increases accounted for most of the increase in sales comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 8.9% in the quarter compared to third quarter last year.","Regionally, in the third quarter 2012, our southeastern division led the sales performance followed by Southwestern division and Midwestern division -- I'm sorry, Eastern division and Midwestern division. Two Paint Store divisions reported sales increases of above 10% compared to last year. Segment profit for the group increased $63.7 million or 26.9% to $300.6 million in the quarter as higher sales volume and selling price increases were partially offset by higher year-over-year raw material costs and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating margin increased to 19.3% from 16.7% in the third quarter last year.","Turning to our Consumer group. Sales in the third quarter decreased 1% to $348 million due primarily to lower sales volumes to most of the group's retail customers, partially offset by acquisitions and higher selling prices. Third quarter segment profit for the consumer group increased $16 million or 39.1% to $57.1 million, due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and higher year-over-year selling prices that were partially offset by higher raw material costs. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 16.4% from 11.7% in the same period last year.","For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars also decreased 1% to $491.8 million in the quarter, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation rate changes and lower paint sales volume, partially offset by selling price increases.","In the quarter, unfavorable currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 4.6%. Stated in U.S. dollars, third quarter segment profit increased $8.8 million or 32.1% to $36.4 million. Higher selling prices and good expense control more than offset higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency rate changes. Currency rate changes decreased segment profit by $5.1 million in the quarter. As a percent to external net sales, segment profit increased to 7.4% from 5.5% in the third quarter last year.","Finally, for our Latin American Coatings Group, third quarter net sales in U.S. dollars decreased 4% to $208.7 million, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation rate changes partially offset by selling price increases and higher paint sales volumes. Unfavorable currency decreased net sales by 13.8% in the quarter. Stated in U.S. dollars, segment profit increased to $21.9 million in the quarter, from $15.9 million last year. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit $3.7 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 10.5% in the quarter, compared to 7.3% in the third quarter of 2011.","That concludes my review of the results for the third quarter 2012, so I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the remainder of the year. Chris?","Christopher M. Connor","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. The third quarter was a solid quarter for Sherwin-Williams in terms of both sales and profit improvement. Consolidated sales increased almost 5%, despite soft market conditions and currency headwinds across most of our nondomestic markets. We also had to overcome the diminishing effect from last year's price increases and a strong revenue growth comparison from the third quarter of last year. Despite that, in many of the financial metrics Bob just walked you through, notably the $2.6 billion in sales for the quarter, $235 million in net income and $2.24 earnings per share, are high watermarks for any quarter in our company's history. Year-to-date, our flow through on operating income is over 31%.","As encouraging as these results are for us, we still see room for improvement. Three of our 4 operating segments reported soft sales in the quarter, and many of end minivan markets we serve, for example, domestic commercial construction in particular, have not yet emerged from recession. Although we've made progress on the gross profit line, our consolidated gross margin remains well below our all-time high of 46% on a full year basis.","If you look at our third quarter results by segments, they were pretty much in line with our expectations. Paint Stores group once again delivered strong year-over-year sales growth at a pace that we believe is comfortably ahead of the industry, roughly half of the segment's revenue growth came from volume. Our investments in new store openings and superior store staffing continues to drive market share growth. Our Consumer group, Global Finishes group and Latin American Coatings Group, reported strong profit for the quarter despite weak demand in many regions of the world. Combined sales of the 3 segments declined slightly, while combined profit increased more than 36%.","The silver lining around weakening international paint coatings demand is the effect it has on raw material cost. Over the past 6 months, the price of high grade chloride, titanium dioxide had eased somewhat due to declining global demand. We've also seen a modest downward trend in the price of propylene, a key feedstock for monomers, latex, solvents and containers. We believe these trends are likely to continue. Based on these developments, we now expect average year-over-year raw material cost inflation for the paint and coatings industry to be in the mid-single-digit range in 2012, down from our previous guidance of mid- to high-single digits. Although the rate of input cost inflation appears to be moderating, the 240-basis-point increase in our third quarter gross margin was helped by better operating efficiencies in our Consumer group. Comparing our 9-month gross margin of 43.9% to last year's 42.7%, perhaps provides a better representation of the progress we've made in offsetting multi-year, raw material inflation with price increases and mix improvement.","SG&A spending was up $40 million in the quarter and increased 10 basis points as a percent to sales. Through the largest contributors to this increase for the new stores opened in the past 12 months, higher incentive compensation as a result of strong financial performance and incremental SG&A from acquisitions.","In the third quarter, we generated $367 million in net operating cash, bringing our 9-month net operating cash to $569 million, an increase of $123 million over the same period last year. Year-to-date, cash from operations has increased $182 million to $628 million. Nine month free cash flow, and we measure free cash flow as net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was at $346 million. We continue to use this cash to invest in the company and expand our control distribution platform, complete suitable acquisitions, increased our dividend and purchase shares of our stock for treasury. In the first 9 months, our Paint Stores group added 28 net new stores, 8 of which were opened in the third quarter. This brings our total store count in the U.S. and Canada and the Caribbean to 3,478 locations, compared to 3,421 a year ago. Our plan calls for Paint Stores group to add approximately 60 to 65 net new store locations during this year.","In the third quarter, we bought back 500,000 shares of our common stock on the open market, bringing our year-to-date total to 3.8 million shares at an average purchase price of $113.96. On September 30, we had remaining authorization to acquire 17.25 million shares.","Last week, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, up from $0.365 last year. It is increasingly obvious that the global economy is slowing, and that risk to the U.S. economy has increased accordingly. However, to date, paint and coatings demand in our domestic businesses has been resilient. We remain optimistic that U.S. architectural paint market volumes primarily in the residential segments, will remain positive in the fourth quarter of 2012 and well beyond, and domestic demand for most industrial coatings will continue to expand. The greatest challenges going forward are likely be worsening market conditions in Latin America and Europe, and the increasingly difficult comparisons. Our outlook for fourth quarter 2012 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the mid-single digits, compared to last year's fourth quarter. With sales at this level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the quarter to be in the range of $0.98 to $1.18 per share, compared to $0.14 per share in 2011, which included a $0.71 per share charge last year for our IRS settlement. For the full year 2012, we expect consolidated net sales to increase by a high single-digit percentage over last year. With annual sales at that level, we've raised our expectation for diluted net income per common share for 2012 to be in the range of $6.35 to $6.55 per share, compared to $4.14 earned in 2011. Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess I'm struck by your overall incremental gross margin in the quarter, which I think was about 95%, and it looks like your cost of goods sold didn't really change year-over-year. So I imagine that some of the raw material benefits that the industry is seeing are now making a larger impression on your income statement even in this quarter. Is that right?","Sean P. Hennessy","I would not say it, Jeff. And I would tell you that, I'd like to paraphrase it this way, and hopefully, it'll explain it. When raw materials are rising, your LIFO expense is catching up. It's always -- is, it's like trying to catch up, and when you start to hit the peak, our LIFO index will still be greater than 1 this year, but that's why we continually talk about the year-to-date, because of all the different things that are going through that cost of goods sold and what you're seeing is last year, the raws were rising dramatically in the third and fourth quarter of last year, so our LIFO is catching up, and that's why we continue to do some of those things. So when I look at it, I think, as Chris said, the 43.9% versus the 42.7%, when you start doing those analysis instead of -- when we start looking at cap variances and LIFO and all the other things that are going on that are affected by those different things, but I think that our year-to-date is probably a better indication. I think the fourth quarter, our gross margin will be higher than last year. I think our gross margin for the year will be at or slightly higher than we are year-to-date. So I think you're going to see, progressively, our gross margin continues to get stronger, and I think that's when you're going to -- I think you're going to see that more in the future, but I think that you can't look at the gross margin in third quarter versus last year, that percentage and say, okay, that's what we're going to see in the future. Last year gross margin in the fourth quarter is 42.8%. That's why I really -- it's, I got a lot of confidence we're going to repeat last year's but, that's why I think year-to-date, we're actually going to see a 43.9% or slightly above that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just going back to the store count of 28 versus your guidance, 60 to 65. Is this sort of a timing issue? Or is there a larger store network that's available that's, perhaps giving you some pause as you build out your stores?","Christopher M. Connor","Ghasham, this has been the historic pattern at Sherwin, despite -- lots of attempts to the contrary. We like to lay these stores in on a little bit more of an orderly path, but for a variety of reasons, many of them outside of our control, for example, real estate developers, communities getting permits passed, et cetera. This always tends to be a heavy fourth quarter waiting. So all the work that we've been doing on these single store, real estate negotiations, getting ready to open these stores, they all just tend to kind of unwind here in the fourth quarter. So we'll hit that number through individual stores.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And just a sort of a higher-level question, right, so Europe isn't huge for you, and a lot of companies in different industries are sort of reassessing whether they want to be in Europe longer-term. Just given what's happened there, does that change any of your strategy or strategic ambitions for that market over time for Sherwin?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, we've been pretty clear about our interest in Europe. We do not have an architectural paint -- desire to be there for a variety of reasons. We, we're in the country, to participate in the Global Industrial Coatings businesses, primarily industrial wood coatings. And at this point in time, there's not been any indication that we'd be strengthening our position over there. I'm happy to have business that we have, and working hard to get them integrated and improve their operating margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the volume breakdown between the same-store channel and the consumer channel? It seems like there was a big dichotomy between the 2 channels, with contractor market really turning around this year. And then just a follow-up on that is, do you expect the contractor market to grow at the same level next year as this year?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. So your first part of your question, P.J., is absolutely correct. The stores had a solid quarter again, almost 10% sales gain, and we commented that approximately half of it was from volume. So again, outperforming, we think, the market conditions. And our consumer group had a soft quarter in sales and there were some pricing there as well, so volumes were even a little softer than that. So there is that dichotomy happening. We've been commenting about the rebounding residential markets in the United States. We're seeing really good numbers coming out now on new construction, and then the result of that, I think the contractor is strengthening, as a larger portion of the U.S. architectural purchasing.","Robert J. Wells","And as far as the question of next year, we're, we always give guidance on our January phone call when we really don't have any indication on the gallonage forecast for 2013. We'll give you guidance in January when we report the full year numbers.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just quickly on the Paint Stores group. Chris, I think you had mentioned earlier at your Analyst Day, that you're keeping your stores open longer, anticipating higher demand? Can you just give us an update on that? And also, on your Platinum paint, which is I think your paint plus primer for the contractor market?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. So from a store hour perspective, P.J., let's say we're always kind of looking at that and tweaking that and we've marginally increased our hours across some markets, a little bit later on weeknights, a little bit longer on Saturday and Sunday, but I don't think that's a significant impact to the company's overall performance. Our recent innovative product launch is in stores, primarily been focused around Emerald, which is this high-end, top-of-the-line zero VOC performance product, which is really doing quite well for the company. As a reminder, when we talk about new product sales, we're identifying those products that have been introduced and have 3 years of run life still, and as group, they account for less than 10% of our revenue. So while we're excited about this new product launch, and what it's doing in the market for our overall mix, it's not a dramatic mover for the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob today. I was wondering if you could comment on your level of inventory on titanium dioxide, and maybe compare it to, say normal levels or where you were a year ago. And then just kind of related to that, as you mentioned over the last 6 months, high-grade chloride, TiO2 prices have come down or at least moderated a bit, and there's definitely a perception that they're going to continue to decline at the year end into the first quarter. So would you look to run down your inventories even further in anticipation of lower prices in the coming year?","Christopher M. Connor","No. We look at our inventory of titanium dioxide, as a raw material. It's very comparable, what it has been for the last few quarters, including last year. We didn't dramatically change, and I don't see us changing that anytime soon. We turn our raw materials so quickly, especially on some of these raws, and as we go into the end of the season, the production plan in the fourth quarter will be normal as, and we're going to make less payments fourth quarter than we have in any other quarter. And then in the first quarter, we'll start to ramp back up. But no plans on changing that normalized view of what we're going to do with our raw materials.","Sean P. Hennessy","And Brian, with respect to our expectations for TiO2 pricing from here, I'm sure it didn't go unnoticed that earlier this week, one of the major TiO2 producers reported earnings and reported volumes in the third quarter down 18%. I suspect that probably the other global chloride producers experienced similar volume declines in the quarter, and that would tend to put pricing pressure on TiO2, downward pricing pressure on TiO2. To your point, we think that, that spot market pricing in TiO2 is probably down in the 10% range, year to date, and perhaps with quite a bit further to go.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess I might just have been confused why wouldn't try and run down the inventories more or is it just the case that you are already kind of at safety stock levels in and now or do you expect prices to decline in response to the volume drop.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. We don't really think about it, running raw inventory down based on cost, I mean we run  an efficient, lean supply chain here. We're turning these raw materials multiple, multiple times a year. We store this stuff in slurry tanks and it really, we have the raw material we need to make the paint we're going to make in the next week or 2. So not a lot of room to run this stuff down.","Sean P. Hennessy","We'll turn titanium back, set between 30 and 34 times a year, so you're talking a 1.5 weeks\u2019 worth of supply. That's 10 days. We sit there and say, moving at the 5 days, what is the net effect? It's not that great.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms of Stephens Incorporated.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Kind of following on that TiO2 being here, just some of your competitors have been out mentioning that they'll be able to substitute a significant amount of their chloride TiO2 consumption with the lower-priced sulfate TiO2, and I know in the past, you guys have said that you have a limited ability to kind of do that. Can you kind of give us an update, kind of where you stand on that today? And then also, kind of what do you think of the impact could be on TiO2 pricing as these coatings guys tend to do more substitution there?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Trey, I think we've heard a number of our competitors comment about the ability to eliminate 5%, 10%, perhaps of their annual chloride titanium demand based on replacement technologies, innovative chemistry, a whole host of practices. I think what we've commented is that we don't see that number being unreachable for us either. We just would be a later adopter. Professional painting contractors, demand for the consistency in our product means that some of these technologies will more likely wind their way into our next round of new products we launch as opposed to going into our core product line and replacing chloride with some of these other technologies. Outside the United States, I think we can do that a little bit easier. We don't use tint base and in-store tinting as much. In Latin America, for example, we do a lot more factory color blending. In that environment, you can switch from the chloride grade directly to the sulfide grade. So some of that activity's taking place as we speak. But I think this is going to be in the margin in terms of replacing it. Though the bigger impact here is that Bob has mentioned in the past has been this softening in the global demand and as a result of that, pricings will come down.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, thanks. And then a question on the Emerald line that you touched on earlier. Can you give us a little bit more color on, kind of what the reception has been? It sounds like it's been pretty good, but is that more kind of DIY-focused or more contractor-focused, and then, also kind of how the pricing differs there?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. It's rarely that we bring a product line out that doesn't have to serve all customer segments, and there's a huge component of this product that we expect the residential repaint contractor to find attractive, and in fact, that's exactly what's happening, Trey. We've seen really good demand across that line. The things that we use to kind of measure the strength of the new product introductions for the company. One would be, are we kind of hitting the targets of gallons that we've set forth at its launch, and we're well ahead of that pace, and secondarily, and perhaps even more important, you hear us talk often about the mix shift inside our company. And as we bring these products out on the very high-end of our product assortment, often times we'll see customers move up inside the other product lines, but had been defined as product is now one level below, and we're seeing nice volume gains in that product which is a product we call Duration as well. So it's having all the kind of impact we'd like to see as a result of this kind of product launch, and quite pleased with it at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Chris, if you had to hazard a guess, where would you see U.S. architectural coatings industry gallonage finishing up for 2012? Trying to get a sense of how far below normalized levels we are still at this point?","Christopher M. Connor","I would think the growth number, Kevin, is probably going to be around 2% to 3%, and I think we're commenting around 2% to 4% halfway through the year. It appears to be moderating a little bit. So on a basis of 615 million gallons for the industry last year, approximately 2% to 3% pop from there.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And so if I peg normalized at maybe 730 to 750 or so, it sounds like you're maybe 15% below, is that fair?","Christopher M. Connor","That's fair.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, just a follow-up, Chris. Be curious to hear your updated views of what you're seeing in the private market since the Geocel deal, which wasn't all that large, you've been pretty quiet or disciplined, shall I say. With the downturn overseas, do you anticipate any opportunities to kind of reinvigorate acquisitions in overseas markets?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Kevin, I think we've stayed very disciplined around the strategic targets that we've shared with the Street repeatedly, namely architectural businesses in the Americas that can kind of strengthen our control distribution play or have really strong compelling brands throughout the Latin American markets, and then smaller bolt-on acquisitions to support our Industrials Coatings businesses, wherever they may be around the world. The fact that we've had a little bit of a softer period here on M&A has not -- anything to do with our interest or the number of doors we're knocking on and the folks we're courting. And when we find things that fit those models and return the kind of disciplined returns we expect, we'd be one to pull the trigger. We have commented that traditionally, a lot of these architectural businesses are owned by private families, and they tend to not want to sell into the down market, but as things start to improve, they've become a little bit more interested in valuing their assets, and so we would expect that maybe over the next couple of years, we'll start to see a little bit more activity there, but nothing to report on today.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, final question if I may, I'll turn it over, is on tax rate. Sean, it's just been creeping up ever so slightly the last 3 quarters. Is that a function of geographic mix? And do you have any preliminary thoughts on where you might be tracking for 4Q in 2013?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I think you're 100% right. It is geographic as -- our Stores group, Consumer group has done very, very well. I think that, we still think that we're going to be able to maintain the tax rate in the low 30s. But, I would say, we're going to be slightly below or slightly above next year where we finish the year this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty of Credit Suisse.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. A quick question on raws and pricing, I guess with the softness in both TiO2, and then even some of the rest of your baskets. Are there any areas where you're having to give back on pricing? Maybe you could just touch a little bit on that?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I think, Abhi, we've commented that in past cycles like this, typically the industry's done a nice job of hanging on to pricing. It's sticky on the way up -- I'm sorry, it's tough on the way up and rather sticky at the top. We did comment that we're still quite a ways below our all-time high in gross margins. So I think there's still work to do that here. We would expect to see in the industry, on large commercial projects heading into next year, if in fact these raws continue to roll over, that we will see some lower prices quoted on these significant volume opportunities. But again, that's somewhat consistent with past practices as well. So we'll see how this one plays out, but that would be our expectation.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And just a quick follow up, could you talk a bit about any potential availability issues or upcoming increases is cost for your acrylics purchases?","Robert J. Wells","We don't anticipate any tightening in those markets. Propylene has been trending down, along with TiO2. We're paying a lower price for propylene per pound today than we would at the beginning of the year. And that, to us, kind of signals ample supply in the market. So we don't see any problems with acrylic pricing or any of the petrochemical-based materials we buy being tighter going forward.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then last quick one, if I may. On M&A, I guess do you have any preferences as to smaller, bolt-on acquisitions? Or are you looking at more medium-sized opportunities as well? Maybe you could just touch a little bit on that.","Christopher M. Connor","We like the ones that return the best profit for the shareholders, regardless of size.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer of Barclays Capital.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I want to go back to the question on incremental and I was looking at incremental EBIT margins throughout the year. It's been very healthy, kind of running anywhere between 23% and 47% this quarter. Could you split out, in those incremental margins, how much is kind of been the volume leverage, and how much has been catch up on raw material price increases from a year ago?","Christopher M. Connor","I think when you take a look at our gross margin year-to-date, 120 basis points, and you look at the volumes that the stores group has created year-to-date, and consumers' year-to-date results, I think that both of those, well over 75%, I don't have an exact numbers, volume. I think that we do, we give a lot more leverage on volumes than we do price, and because a lot of times, the price is really motivated by higher raw materials. So to answer your questions, it's the majority of volume.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Terrific. And then, if you take a quick look forward to '13, what do you see that, this year might've been one-off? So we had the warmer Q1, so when we think about year-over-year comps going into next year, what things could we be looking for that might not repeat, either good or bad?","Robert J. Wells","Yes. I think when you take a look at the first quarter, I think you said it correctly. I think as -- we're not prepared to talk about next year, but we think that the first quarter, when you look at the sales increase and the gallons increase and the weather that we experienced, some of it had to deal with weather. And I think over the full year, I think that might be timing, but I do think that we still feel that, if the market, in the total year goes up, we're going to gain market share. And so, we think that's really our long-term thought. So we look at it. Besides that, I don't think -- I can't think of anything that was -- I think this has been one of the more normal years, expect for the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Chris, you mentioned that the domestic resiliency that you're experiencing should mitigate the slowing globally? And we certainly saw strength in the Paint Stores and obviously, coming from the underlying strength of the new construction market that you spoke to. But can you dig in a little bit more for us, understanding the end markets with respect to what's happening, mass merchants versus a retail or a consumer-oriented customers, as well as sort of the non-res commercial markets. We know public spending, is obviously, it's got a major headwinds versus private spending. What you could drill in at any more detail, and whether you're optimistic that you're seeing anything that would suggest things are going to lag, like they normally do, the residential improvement and new construction.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. So there's a lot to chew on there, Ivy. But let's start with, kind of the mass merchants' performance. We reported that our consumer group had a soft quarter. And when we look inside our own stores, at our own DIY business, it was one of the poor performing of the segments inside that store's business, so I think there may be some softening there a little bit. Hard to tell, if it's just a blip for the quarter or a longer trend. What impact the election, I mean, the uncertainties having in that area. I think it's a little early to make that call. Some of the more dependable segments that we can look at and think through and plan out on both residential, whether that's new residential or residential repaint, continue to be the real strength for the company. These are our segments that are performing high single-digits, low double-digits, in terms of year-over-year performance in the quarter, and then as we've commented briefly in the opening statement, relative to the commercial market still, it's lagging, and we would expect that to be that way, it tends to follow housing, so if housing comes back, we would expect new commercial construction to rebound and that would be a little bit of a tailwind for the company. We're encouraged by the housing start permit numbers that we saw out this week, and I mean, to Sean's point, we look at the next year, I think we're feeling pretty good that this residential market in the United States has still got a lot of runway.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","If you broke out and looked at the business, excluding public spending for non-res projects, would it look any different? Or is it also soft within that spending market if you take it in sort of an aggregate look?","Christopher M. Connor","Right. We -- when we break it down by ZIP code and so forth, it's the softness is -- public in, public, Ivy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson of Nomura Securities.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Hoping you can just shed some light on a couple of things. One, you mentioned the efficiencies inside the Consumer group. Can you give us a little bit more detail about what it is that you're doing to  improve those efficiencies? And then second, I know your SG&A growth as a percent of sales growth looked a little high in this quarter. I think you generally target that around 40% or 50%. And then the last thing is if you can give us the gross margins by category, at least those gross profit cells that are so helpful every other quarter, and I'd appreciate that.","Sean P. Hennessy","Sure, okay. The couple of things on the consumer group, I think just by on putting gallons through those plans, I think that you gain efficiencies. We have many projects that are ongoing, whether they're raw material delivery or fill lines and so forth, and you're -- really a lot of singles and doubles there that continue to do very well for us. As we continue to get other plants underneath that management team, Geocel and so forth, you're going to see improvements there. But #1, is really just getting those gallons through and the efficiencies that those gallons will create. The second question, I think, hopefully I remember all 3. But your SG&A, you talk about the SG&A and I think that the SG&A, a lot of the SG&A growth we had was in the United States. And where -- as we continue to develop new stores, as we continue to put new stores in, putting people in the stores, hours in the stores, as well as we've continued to spend on the -- in the admin segment. As for IT projects that eventually, down the road, will create higher cash flow for us in nondomestic markets. So when the FX effect had so much effect on the sales in a couple of our segments, in the U.S., the SG&A will go up. And I think when you look at us, compared to sales, but I think if you look at it year-to-date, and notice the 30.7% in the quarter versus 30.6%, we're up 10 basis points. But year-to-date on SG&A, we're down 60 basis points, and I think when you start to look at it on a year-to-date basis, those targets that we usually hit are, we're a lot closer to that. So I think that all the operating margins by operating segment, our operating margins are fine, but things are going pretty well. On the -- on the Paint Stores group sales, incremental margin dollars were $93.7 million. Consumer group was $20.7 million. Global Finishing group was a positive $3.9 million and Latin American group was actually negative $5.7 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich of ISI Group.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is Matt McGinley on for Greg. If we go back to the Consumer group for a minute. I'm still not sure I completely understand what happened with the units here. Did you see a draw down on the sundry product that you sell, as well as the coatings? And in terms of, if you have access to point-of-sale data, are you seeing a self -- issues of sell-through versus inventory depletion, and have the channel partners that you sell into there, have they, perhaps attempted to reduce their inventories to try and push back on price? Or are you starting to have those conversations with those retailers?","Christopher M. Connor","Matt, on the mix between paint and various sundries, I would say is, it's very consistent across the board of all the baskets and material we sell, that it was just a soft quarter. Then I think that's more indicative of the kind of foot traffic and a little slower out-the-door performance. As usual, this time of year, we do see some inventory focus from some of these partners where they're trying to squeeze inventory a little bit, and that happens frequently, and so I don't think that we can put it entirely at that. For the 9 months, numbers for all these categories there all positive, and they're all doing well, and so we'll just have to see what their -- this is a, falling off or just a little bit of a quarter blip here. In terms of pricing, we're always have those conversations with our partners, and they're -- pay close attention to the feed-stocks of these businesses and so I would expect that, that's something we'll be dealing with going forward.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then my second question is back on the SG&A. Given you had pretty good sales growth, and I understand that you had your -- you're doing investments, there's new stores you're putting out, you've done some acquisitions and I assume that the higher incentive expense wouldn't stay that high forever. But at what point would you expect to leverage SG&A at a higher level? Is it -- should I think about it terms of the unit growth? Should I think about it in terms of a sales level that you would achieve? Or, I guess when would you have better SG&A leverage, given the pretty high rate of sales you experienced this year?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. And I think when you take a look at it, we've -- it's also where the sales growth has come in the stores group. I think they'll continue to invest, I think again, you've mentioned the comp. I think that the comp -- but I think we've set the company up, that we're going to have a couple of years of nice SG&A growth. I think, or I mean, not growth, but improvement as a percent of sales. We hit our highest 35.7%, last year around 33.1%. I think -- as -- or 33.8%. I think you're going to see some of that improvement over time.","Christopher M. Connor","I think, for the next period of time over the next couple of years, you're going to see that SG&A  improve.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","What do you think that, that would get to as a percentage of sales over time?","Sean P. Hennessy","What we've commented is, that we used to just talk about a 33%, 33.5%, we think that, and then we start seeing the 10, 20 basis points improvement. With the change, we think that we're probably at 33%, and then you're going to start seeing that 10 or 20 basis points improvement. And that's an annual number. I know we're below that through the first 3 quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research Company.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Two things. First of all, you talked about gaining share, a good amount in the Architectural Paint business, I think that's sort of what you're talking about. Can you talk about what's driving that? And then also, related to that, you've taken them, if there's a little bit cautious and more cautious to you on growth. Can you just again, define what you're seeing different, in terms of growth?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Eric, I think from a share perspective, there's a couple of things that we can look at. Industry gallon data, which used to be reported by the federal government, is not anymore, we're cobbling together these points from raw material suppliers and other industry sources. Our sense is that the market's grown, probably on a volume basis, around 2% to 3%, and so we're able to look at the kind of gallons we're putting through our footprint here and feel comfortable that, that's outperforming the market. When we look inside the performance in the individual segments, these professional painting contractor segments are outperforming, and just as we saw those get harder hit in the industry downturn, they're the ones that are rebounding a little quicker as we're going forward. So our expectation would be that we continue to see that kind of share shift towards the painter, and we continue to benefit from them.","Sean P. Hennessy","On the second one, Eric, when you asked about our outlook. One of the things that we've commented on the last few calls is that, the gallons may continue to be strong, but the selling price is going to -- it's not going to be as strong. Think about couple of -- and I'll tell you right now, when you look at the third quarter to fourth quarter, you heard Chris comment on the Stores group, half of that growth was volume, half of it was approximately price. We think that the price between third and fourth quarter of 2012, we're going to have half of what we realized in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter. So and we also think that the headwinds on the nondomestic will not be as strong, and I think that all comes back to that mid-single digits. So I think that it's not so much that we feel we're not that worried about our get a little worried about volume. I think it's we're seeing less and less price in that Paint Stores group.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Great, and then secondly, you talked about gross margin relative to the peak at 46%. I'm just curious what you think the path from here to there is what drives that, how long that path might be.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. The path will be along the lines of the pricing, finishing off and as you know the last price increase we've announced through our Stores business was in February, so that one\u2019s just about behind us. You're going to see the efficiency through the whole supply chain adding some lift to that, as volume continues to go through that fixed asset base in our Consumer group, and then obviously, as the raws tip over, and we can hang onto pricing per the earlier question. That'll help us get there. Whether that happens in the span of a year or 2 or 3, we're not making any comments on that.","Sean P. Hennessy","And we also need some help from non-stores and nonconsumer segments. I think when you look at the lower operating margins, I think that some of the things we've done to improve, especially in the Global Finishes Group, again, we feel pretty good about the ongoing integration, and we think that'll help us with our gross margin, as well as operating margin in the future, and that'll help us get back on the peak.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Nocella of RBC Capital Markets.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just in Latin America, you had very strong margins in the third quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. Maybe you can just help us understand how you will achieve those margins? And maybe give us your early read on demand in Latin America as we enter their seasonally stronger period now?","Christopher M. Connor","I would tell you right now, we hit positive volumes in Latin America in the third quarter, and you're right, the fourth quarter is stronger for us than the fourth quarter (sic), just having more of that will help us improve our margin in the fourth quarter versus third quarter. And I think it's going to be volume in there, and also just -- we're continuing to work on selling prices in the Latin America group.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And can you just comment on your outlook for new store growth for next year?","Sean P. Hennessy","We've been saying that we'd expect to continue to increase that and ramp up. We identify kind of that 50 store pace, or 1 store a week is kind of idle speed and as markets improve, that we would be ramping that back up. We haven't given guidance on that yet, but we have said that over a longer decade period, on a more normalized run rate, kind of 70 to 80 stores is the right average to be at. So we'll be north of the 60 to 65 number that we're going to do this year and next year, and we'll you some more clarity on that on the first quarter call.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Dan of Morgan Stanley.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just to clarify, do you guys have any LIFO liquidation benefit in the quarter?","Sean P. Hennessy","I would say no.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And it seemed like you slowed down the pace of your share repurchases and brought down the leverage on the balance sheet. Can you give us some perspective on why that might have slowed, and how we should think about the share count going forward?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I think when we look at a stock buybacks, we're always talking about an annualized number. So far this year, we've brought back 3.8 million shares, spent $433 million, that's about $100 million more than last year. Our -- we feel pretty good about where we are, I think that we probably bought it. We're watching a lot of different things right now. We're -- we like where our balance sheet is. Our balance sheet's in a pretty good spot if some of these assets would become available here in the fourth quarter or early first quarter, so we're watching that. And that's what we've always said. We don't see over time that our debt is going to go down. Our EBITDA's been strong. So we're still going to target that 1:1 when it comes to EBITDA. So over time, we'll spend that money either on acquisitions or stock buybacks. So we've looked at it. We still feel pretty good about where we are, buying 3.8 year-to-date, and that's what we do. We looked a lot at it, on an annual, not a quarter-by-quarter number.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just have a couple of quick questions. First, for the quarter, what was the -- your material cost, up year-over-year?","Sean P. Hennessy","We will -- maybe you talk about the full basket, but for us, we never comment on ours, and usually we don't even comment on a quarter-to-quarter, but usually on a year-to-date. And I think what we've said is that, our raw material baskets, beginning in the year, we were looking at high single digit, low teens, and now we're saying that it's going to be in that low single digits. So you can probably tell that most of the increase was in the first half of the year.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then in the Paint Stores, I think you give the gross profit dollar increase, what was the SG&A dollars?","Sean P. Hennessy","That, I will tell you, I\u2019ll have to look up the Q. I'll grab it out of the Q, and then -- it's 27.4.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then the last question is, when you look forward, you've had great leverage that you\u2019ve shown, so it's like, I guess you're going to be in the high single-digit sales, and then somewhere around 30% type of earnings growth. Would you expect the same -- is -- would that ratio change, going forward over the next couple of years? Or is there any reason it would or wouldn't?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think as Sean commented on one of the earlier answers, it really is about volumes, so the extent that, that volume number keeps going at that pace, that's the kind of leverage that we can get through the system.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky of North Coast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","I want to get back to the administrative costs and the SG&A costs. Sean, if I go through the segments and back out, a couple of adjustments, you guys show those administrative costs. How much of that is including IT projects and acquisition-related SG&A that's allocated to the quarters, or exclusive was allocated to the quarters, and how much is -- has to be explained by other things?.","Sean P. Hennessy","No, I would say the majority of it is, as we mentioned before and actually in the admin segments and you look at the admin segments through 9 months is $54 million higher than last year. You take out some of the environmental hits and disposition of assets, you're down to about the high 40s, just about half of that is in compensation. And probably another 30%, 40% of that is IT projects and investments and so forth and especially on acquisitions that eventually, we think they create cash flows from our nondomestic operations.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Now with the volume growth in the stores business, how is the SG&A up? Because I would think that would be good opportunity to leverage occupancy and in store labor, but are there other things to consider?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. We talked about the incentive compensation, Chuck. We were riding this market down, we\u2019re paying a lot of bonuses. And we've told you, we've got practically that entire Stores organization on variable comp plans. So they're having a good year.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","So their incentive comp hits below the segments, as well as within some of the segments.","Sean P. Hennessy","That's true. Some of the variable compensation and RSOs and other things and annual bonuses are held at the administrative segment. But I wanted to correct something. When we did say that our SG&A in the store was up $27 million, I don't want to give you the idea that our SG&A there didn't -- did go higher in terms of sales, but it didn't dramatically go down, but you sit then take look at it, the operating margin is up, and it's been helped by margin as well as SG&A. I think when we were talking about the SG&A in total, because of those dollars, and then the other sales numbers were negatively affected by FX, those numbers then become -- it's more dramatic, higher global sales, not just store sales.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Okay. And then on LIFO, can you give us what the LIFO charge was year-over-year, the comparable numbers?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I think LIFO -- I'll tell you, I'm going to get back to you on that one.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just 2 questions. One, just wondering why you're a little more cautious on overall growth, I think you said you thought total U.S. gallonage now is up 2% to 3%. You were thinking maybe 3% to 4% earlier in the year. And then on stores, I mean, you talk about how Paint Stores sales group is, contractors gaining share from the big box. But are you gaining share from some of your competitors\u2019 stores? I noticed that Akzo had their U.S. stores volumes continue to be down year-over-year. Ben Moore's having issues, so I'm just wondering how much you're benefiting there, and does that create an opportunity to be more aggressive on store openings as competitors pull back a bit?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Don, regarding the U.S. growth of architectural market. I think we've been looking at some of the -- our competitors releases here, and commenting about some softness in the U.S. architectural market. We don't really have a good data other than when it comes lagging to us a little bit. So I wouldn't read too much into our earlier estimates was 2% to 4%, now we're 2% to 3%. It could be very much in line with what we've been saying. As Sean commented on one of the earlier questions, the volume numbers through our store business has been fine, we've just been seeing the impact of price roll back a little bit. So we're not feeling very cautious here in our guidance. We're feeling that we're still seeing the strong U.S. residential, architectural market and we're feeling good about the position the company is in. And capitalize on that, increasing store counts next year over this year, so all those things are making us feel like we've got a long way to go here to capitalize on this rebounding residential market. In terms of gaining share within the channel against some of the other small, independent paint store chain operators and\/or regional or national operators as you mentioned Akzo. Yes, I think we would feel comfortable that we're doing that as well. We know that just by store count, for one way to get at it, we've put these or plan to have these 60 to 65 stores in this year. That will be a significant multiple of the rest of the competitors combined, and in fact, on those independents, we've seen quite a number of those stores. We think perhaps as many as 1,000 of them have gone out over the last 3 to 4 years during this downturn. So clearly gaining share inside the paint store channel as well.","Sean P. Hennessy","Don, one more kind of color point on the residential repaint market. Chris mentioned in his opening comments that DIY was one of the market segments that was probably softer than most. Don't read that as a decline in demand in -- for residential repaint, because residential repaint contractor volume is actually pretty strong. What we may be saying is kind of this discretionary shift back towards the contractor and away from DIY.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of questions or the couple of comments you made about the raw material pricing. You said that propylene pricing is coming down, and you implied you're buying propylene. Are you in fact, buying propylene? Are you buying propylene derivatives?","Christopher M. Connor","It's the latter. We are actively buying propylene-based commodities.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Right, okay. Is your -- is the products that you're purchasing, whether it's resins or packaging or solvents, have you seen pricing there decline?","Sean P. Hennessy","We have. It typically declines on a 90 to 120 day lag. So we're just starting to feel the impact of the decline in propylene. And as you know, the decline in propylene has been kind of a long, slow decline, as opposed to a sharp drop.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So the important point though is that you are seeing the downstream products made from propylene starting to decline for you in price?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, some of them.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Excellent. Then the second question, on the Global sales I -- or the Global Group sales. I'm sort of finding that the comments in the press release a little bit confusing. You talked about 9 month or through the 9 month year-over-year, having about a 2.4% contribution I think you said from acquisitions, which implies that the acquisitions were negative in the third quarter. That doesn't make sense. Can you take me through the sales components in the Global group?","Sean P. Hennessy","I'll tell you what. How about if we go to the next question, we'll come back -- let me, give me a second to pull that out, okay, Dmitry?","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","That's fine. And then, my last question, again, has to do with the Consumer group and the -- sort of the declining volumes have [indiscernible] margin based on more gallons processed. I think that, that refers to the gallonage growth that you're seeing in the -- in your store group, which flows through the consumer group margin. Is that the right way to put it?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. That's exactly right. The consumer group is the North American supply chain provider for the company. So every gallon manufactured, distributed through the chain, supporting their consumer's external brands, as well as other stores go through that P&L, so you're getting the lift as volume goes through that control asset base, we transfer that on a fully loaded price to our stores. But as volume comes and efficiencies are enhanced, consumer can get the leverage on that operating margin, and that's how they get to the numbers you saw today.","Sean P. Hennessy","And Dmitry, if I go back to that answer for the acquisitions, you're right. The acquisitions on a 9 month is 2.4%, and it was 0 for the third quarter. That's because we've annualized it.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So my calculation is correct. It just sounded...","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. We no longer put the quarter in there because we've annualized it. I understand what the confusion there was, but no, it wasn't flat or down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nils Wallin from CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","The NAHPs remodeled index came out and it's at above -- it\u2019s at 50, and it's probably at one of the highest levels since '05, and even in the peak. But most of it seems to come from the owner occupied side, as it goes to rental properties or in major alterations. So I'm wondering if the rental part of that index or the major alterations, if those move up towards 50, is that going to have a meaningful impact on your results?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, it will. And multifamily's an important segment for us, and unlike the owner occupied residential, which can be a DIY project or a painting contractor project, typically in multifamily, you're seeing a paying contractor being employed to do that, so as that segment strengthens, that's good for our industry.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","So then, would you say that most of your contractor business is then still focused on the single-family, as opposed to the multifamily? Or is there just -- I mean is there just a different mix there?","Christopher M. Connor","Well the weight in the country would indicate that we have probably 60% to 65% of American citizens are in an owned-occupied thing, 35% to 40% would be in rental property. So to the extent that of contractors are doing a lot of work in the residential repaints for an owner-occupant, that still the larger segment for us, but we still have a sizable business in this multifamily. As that improves, as occupancy rates improve, as turnover improves, because that's when you get the painting opportunity, those will all be drivers for volume through our stores group.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Great. And then just one final question. The kind of softness in Global Finishes. I know that you've obviously, you highlighted regions outside of North America were you don't have as big a presence as some of your competitors, but I was wondering if you would be able to drill down to say, whether it was on the Protective and Marine side, or auto with finishes, if there's any differences there in those different end markets.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. The biggest peak for business we have in Global Finish group is our OEM product finishes. This is where we're coating durable goods in a manufactured factory environment for sales and I think that's been probably the softer of the 3 segments. The Protective and Marine coatings, which is also embedded in here has probably been the stronger of the 3 segments and Automotive would be somewhere in the middle.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","One of your largest global competitors had some uncertainty in the executive suite right now, and their U.S. strategy has been a little bit debatable. Does that already see to maintaining some flexibility here over the next couple of quarters to see whether or not they shift gears?","Christopher M. Connor","No. I think that there's a lot of different things out there right now. I don't think specifically that asset is causing us to keep our balance sheet flexible.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. How about store openings? Might want to wait to see what happens to store openings?","Christopher M. Connor","No. Their store model has been diminishing as an impactful competitor and our plans to continue opening stores are in line with our long-term strategy of building out density, strengthening some of the weaker markets, and that doesn't change regardless of their actions.","Operator","Our final question of the day comes from the line of Jeff Jeffrey Zekauskas as a follow-up question of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to follow-up on the question I asked an hour ago. In asking you about TiO2, I think Chris made a throwaway comment where he said, \"Well, I think there's a lot more room for TiO2 prices to fall.\" And I was wondering why you thought that?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, I think we're historians here, Jeff, as you know, and we've been through a number of these titanium runs in the past. I think if some of the earlier questions about the industry moving aggressively to try to find replacement technologies and a lot of that work's just coming to fruition, as we see continuing softness in some of these global markets. As demand continues to remain weak here, history would indicate this commodity will continue to have some softness in pricing. Time will tell. We are just starting the early tipping over points. Now we see the spot market is retracted probably 10 percentage points plus or minus a little bit from the peak, and our expectation would be that in past cycles, that wasn't the end of the pull back, that it would continue from there.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So what caused the tip in that TiO2 demand to stand very, very weak now, for almost a year, and then finally, in the second or at the end of the second quarter, it sort of broke. What caused the break? Or how did the timing work?","Christopher M. Connor","I think it's all in demand. We talked about the price announcements that were put in by the industry, softening beginning as early as last year about this same time, where they had previously been getting 100% of their announced price increases for the better part of 8, 9, 10 quarters, and then the fourth quarter won about 50% effectiveness similar to first quarter, and we think the industry basically did not take the second quarter announcement at all. So it didn't just break recently, it's been softening now over the past 12 months, as demand has been falling off, and that's all that demand.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any closing comments.","Robert J. Wells","Thanks again, Jesse. Those of you who are still on the call have gone above and beyond the call of duty with an 1 hour and 10 minutes. As usual, we'll be around today and all day tomorrow, to take your follow-up calls.

After the Company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions.","I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Jessie. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us.","In the interest of time, we have provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information, including a slide deck with a breakdown of results by our new reportable segment on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, October 24th press release.","I\u2019ll begin by highlighting overall Company performance for the third quarter 2017 compared to third quarter 2016, then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased 37.4% or $1.23 billion to $4.51 billion due primarily to Valspar sales and higher paint sales volume in the Americas Group and Performance Coatings Group, partially offset by the impact of the hurricanes in Texas, Florida and the Caribbean. Excluding Valspar results, core consolidated sales increased 4.6% over the third quarter last year, with a significant portion of the increase coming from sales to our North American paint stores.","Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $265.7 million or 16.2% to $1.9 billion in the quarter. Our consolidated gross margin decreased 770 basis points in the quarter to 42.2% of sales from 49.9% in the third quarter last year. Excluding the impact from Valspar, core gross margins declined 140 basis points in the quarter to 48.5% of sales.","Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 24.4% or $256 million over the third quarter last year to $1.31 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased 300 basis points to 29.0% in the third quarter this year from 32.0% last year. Excluding the impact from Valspar, core SG&A increased $50.2 million in the quarter or 10 basis points as a percent of sales.","Interest expense increased $47.5 million compared to third quarter last year to $91.6 million. This increase was entirely due to acquisition-related interest expense. Amortization increased to $83.7 million from $8.2 million last year due to the increase in intangible assets related to the Valspar acquisition. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $107.9 million or 20.1% to $427.7 million. Excluding the impact from Valspar, PBT declined $19 million or 3.3% to $553.4 million, which includes a $42 million negative impact from the natural disasters in the quarter.","Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 26.0%. For the full year 2017, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in that mid to high 20% range. Consolidated net income decreased $70.1 million or 18.1% to $316.6 million.","Net income as a percent of sales was 7.0% compared to 11.8% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter decreased 18.4% to $3.36 per share from $4.08 per share in 2016. The $3.33 per share includes a $1.42 per share in acquisition-related expenses including inventory step-up and purchase accounting amortization and income of $0.49 per share from Valspar operations. We have summarized the year-over-year earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our third quarter 2017 press release.","Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for the Americas Group in the third quarter 2017 increased $154.7 million or 6.5% to $2.540 billion from $2.38 billion last year. This increase was primarily due to higher architectural paint sales volumes across most end markets, and selling price increases partially of set by the impact of the hurricanes primarily in our Southeastern and Southwestern divisions. Sales in the Latin America region stated in U.S. dollars, increased 4.9% in the quarter.","Comparable store sales in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.2%. Regionally, in the third quarter, our Canada division led all divisions, followed by Midwestern division, Southwestern division, Eastern and Southeastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division.","Segment profit for the group increased $6.3 million or 1.2% to $525.6 million in the quarter as higher architectural paint sales volumes and selling price increases were partially offset by higher raw material costs and the negative impact of the storms in the quarter. Segment operating margin decreased to 20.7% of sales from 21.8% in the third quarter last year.","Turning to the Consumer Brands Group. Third quarter sales increased $325.1 million or 81.6% to $723.3 million due primarily to the inclusion of Valspar sales, partially offset by lower volume sales to most of consumer group\u2019s retail customers. Excluding sales from Valspar, core sales for the group decreased 2.7% in the quarter.","Segment profit per Consumer Brands decreased $16.8 million or 19.2% to $70.4 million in the quarter due to acquisition-related inventory step-up and increased amortization costs, totaling $54.6 million and higher raw material costs that were partially offset by improved operating efficiencies, good expense control and selling price increases. Excluding the balance Valspar impact, core segment profit was essentially flat year-over-year.","Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 9.7% from 21.9% in the same period last year. Most of the impact in segment profit margin was from acquisition-related expenses, negative margin mix from the addition of Valspar businesses and higher raw material costs. Excluding Valspar, core operating margin for the group increased 50 basis points to 22.4%. For our Performance Coatings group, sales in U.S. dollars increased $746.9 million or 150.8% to $1.24 billion in the quarter due to the addition of Valspar sales, higher core paint sales volume, and selling price increases. Excluding Valspar, core sales for the group increased 2.1% in the quarter. Stated in U.S. dollars, third quarter segment profit decreased $8.4 million or 12.4% to $59.6 million due primarily to acquisition-related inventory step-up and increased amortization costs totaling a $102 million. Excluding Valspar, core segment profit declined 15.9% in the quarter. As a percent of external sales, segment profit decreased to 4.8% from 13.7% in the same period last year. Excluding Valspar, core operating margin for the group decreased 240 basis points to 11.3% of sales.","That concludes our review of the third quarter results for 2017. So, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Morikis who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year. John?","John Morikis","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.","Third quarter 2017 was a challenging quarter, particularly for those living in the path of the violent hurricanes and earthquakes we all witnessed. I think it\u2019s fitting that I begin my remarks this morning by acknowledging and thanking all the Sherwin-Williams associates in Texas, Florida, Georgia, the Caribbean and Mexico who served countless hours of volunteer work in the disaster relief and cleanup efforts, went above and beyond the call of duty in helping our customers get back on their feet, and got our stores and facilities up and running in record time. These communities are home to Sherwin-Williams and that point is very evident in the ongoing efforts of our people.","Our results in the third quarter were slightly better than the revised expectations we communicated back on September 27th. Although the storms and earthquakes disrupted the operations of as many as 650 paint stores, the impact in terms of lost sales in the quarter was at the low end of our expected range of $50 million to $70 million. This good news, if you can call it that, was offset by moderately higher than expected raw material inflation as a result of storm-related supply interruptions, primarily in the Houston petrochemical complex. The combined effect of lost sales, higher raw material rates and LIFO charges taken in the quarter, decreased our third quarter consolidated gross margin by about 30 basis points.","The hurricane disruptions also pushed our full-year estimate of industry average raw material cost inflation to the high end of our mid single digit range. The spike in some raw materials is likely temporary and should diminish as propylene and ethylene production returns to normal. Others may have a longer term impact. In either case, higher year-over-year raw material costs and LIFO will be a stronger headwind to earnings in fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter.","The October 1st price increase in our North American paint stores should help to mitigate the impact of higher raw materials. Similar actions are underway as needed in our other lines of business.","Natural disasters of this nature have a disproportionate effect on profitability because lost sales and gross profit cannot be offset in the short-term by reduced operating expenses. In total, these events decreased our earnings per share in the quarter about $0.27 compared to the $0.35 impact we anticipated at the end of September.","The sales momentum we saw across most of our North American businesses prior to the storms, was encouraging. Comparable store sales growth in our North American paint stores was running in the high single digits, and that momentum appears to be resuming as the effects of the storms diminish. Even with the storm impact, sales to residential repaint contractors grew double digits in the third quarter, and DIY sales to our stores grew high single digits. Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings Group, both show sequential revenue improvement in the third quarter, and we expect that progress to continue as well.","The natural disasters last quarter did not derail our plans for new store openings. In the first nine months, the Americas Group opened 50 net new stores and added 104 new sales territories in the U.S. Canada and the Caribbean, bringing our total store count in the region to 4,230 compared to 4,141 a year ago. Our plan for the full year still calls for store openings in the range of 90 net new locations in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean compared to 94 last year. In Latin America, we added 11 net new stores and added 44 new dedicated dealer locations in the first nine months. We currently operate 350 company stores and sell our products to 682 dedicated dealer locations compared to 316 and 619, respectively a year ago.","Valspar integration plans and synergy progress continue to track with the expectations we communicated as recently as October 3rd at our financial community presentation. We remain focused on strengthening the performance of both our core businesses and our newly acquired businesses. This focus includes implementing appropriate pricing initiatives to offset increasing raw material costs, and continuing to focus on volume improvements in all businesses and all regions.","In the first nine months of 2017, we generated $1.26 billion in net operating cash, an increase of almost $300 million compared to the first nine months of 2016 and greater than 11% of net sales. On September 30th, the Company had $208 million of cash on hand that will be utilized to reduce debt and fund operations. The Company made no open market purchases of common stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2017.","Year-to-date, capital expenditures totaled $143 million and we anticipate approximately $200 million in capital expenditures for the full year. Depreciation through nine months was $162 million, and total amortization including purchasing accounting and inventory step up was $233 million. ","Incremental depreciation and amortization related to Valspar acquisition purchase accounting has been revised to approximately $300 million on an annual basis. Purchase accounting inventory adjustments of $140 million were amortized over June, July and August 2017.","The Regulation G reconciliation table near the back of this morning\u2019s press release includes $1.04 per share of full year transaction and integration costs, which is up from our second quarter guidance of $0.60 for full year. This increase reflects the cost of facility consolidations that had not been announced as of our second quarter release.","The balance sheet reflects preliminary purchase accounting balances and incremental debt of approximately $9.5 billion used to fund the acquisition. Net payments of long-term debt totaling approximately $700 million were made in the nine months at the -- ended September 30, 2017. Last week, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share, up from $0.84 last year.","As I mentioned a moment ago, we\u2019re encouraged by the continued momentum in our business. While fourth quarter is a lower demand quarter from a seasonal prospective, we believe a strong fourth quarter can help us make up some of the lost revenue and profit from the third quarter. As such, we\u2019re maintaining our outlook for full year consolidated earnings per share excluding Valspar-related costs of $15 per share at the midpoint of the range.","For the fourth quarter, we anticipate Sherwin-Williams core net sales will increase a mid to high single digit percentage compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. In addition, we expect incremental sales from the Valspar acquisition to be approximately $1 billion.","At that anticipated sales level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter of 2017 to be in the range of $1.97 to $2.27 per share, including a $0.98 per share charge from costs associated with the Valspar acquisition and an EPS contribution of $0.15 to $0.25 per share from Valspar operations. The increase in Valspar operations includes an acquisition financing expense charge of $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2016 earnings were $2.15 per share and included a $0.22 per share charge for acquisition-related costs.","For the full year 2017, we expect Sherwin-Williams core net sales to increase by mid single digit percentage compared to full year 2016. In addition, we expect incremental sales from the Valspar acquisition to be approximately $2.5 billion in 2017. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance for full year 2017 diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.20 to $11.50 per share compared to the $11.99 per share earned in 2016.","Full year 2017 diluted net income per common share guidance includes a $3.21 per share charge from costs associated with the acquisition of Valspar and includes an EPS increase of $0.75 to $0.85 per share from Valspar operations. The increase from Valspar operations includes an acquisition financing expense charge of $0.96 per share for the full year. Full year 2016 earnings per share included an $0.86 per share charge related to the Valspar acquisition.","Again, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","It\u2019s difficult to look at the Valspar numbers year-over-year because months of their quarter are different than months your months. Did the Valspar numbers -- did the Valspar volumes and price shrink in the quarter and is that what you expect for the fourth quarter? Can you frame what\u2019s happening in the year-over-year operations of Valspar?","Al Mistysyn","Hey, Jeff. This is Al Mistysyn. I would say, the Valspar performance in the quarter is really right where we expected it to be. We had a EPS guidance of $0.50, we came in about $0.49. So, the trend that you saw and the volumes which are holding up fairly well specifically on the Performance Coatings side, continued; and margin pressure that we\u2019ve been under also continued. So, both expected in the quarter and we saw that. In the fourth quarter, certainly, we will see some pickup in our pricing activities as our price actions roll in. We\u2019ll see some of that in our fourth quarter but we\u2019ll see more of that in our first quarter. And with sales being a little bit lower in our fourth quarter, that\u2019s why you see the impact of EPS in our fourth quarter, which we guided to $0.20 versus the $0.49 we saw in the third quarter.","Jeff Zekauskas","So, is Valspar growing?","Al Mistysyn","They are growing. Volume is growing and what we should expect to see and we\u2019ll guide this in our 2018 guidance is what the impact of the pricing will be in.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes. Good morning. Couple of accounting questions, if I may. First, you indicated in your press release that the purchase accounting inventory adjustment was a $115 million across June, July and August. Would I be correct in taking two thirds of that figure or 76 to $77 million for the impact in the third quarter? And if so, how would that be allocated among your segments, please?","Jane Cronin","Kevin, yes, that would be correct. You could take two thirds of that amount for the third quarter, allocated across the segments would be about $41 million in Performance Coatings in the quarter and about $34 million in Consumer Brands in the quarter.","Kevin McCarthy","Thank you for that. And then second, I noticed that you are now expecting incremental D&A related to purchase accounting of $300 million whereas, I think at your investor day, you were closer to $270 million, if my memory is correct. I was wondering if you could comment on what changed in recent weeks?","Al Mistysyn","Kevin, really, as we go through the process of the valuation, we are reviewing that really month-to-month to finalize what values are on trademarks, customer lists and that. And what we see in that increase is a little bit of a switch from goodwill to more finite life intangibles. And that\u2019s why you saw the increase. I don\u2019t expect it to change materially going forward, but if it does, we certainly would give you an update.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan","Could you guys discuss a little bit more on the volume performance in the quarter in your outlook? I was just curious, in paint stores, you have a pretty decent showing versus the last couple of years on Q3. So, do you think that kind of mid single digit growth is sustainable?","John Morikis","Yes. We are pretty pleased with the performance of our stores. And if you look at that progress that we have made, we have mentioned this before, our pro business, we\u2019ll grow the pro business in our stores by 0.5 billion in the year. If you back out DIY and Protective & Marine. So, we are feeling pretty good about the momentum that we have in our stores organization. And that does, Arun, take into account also the storm. So, we talked about the momentum that we had going into the storm, we did take a short pause in the period of the storm. And then, as we mentioned, we feel as those pick right back up where we were running.","Al Mistysyn","And Arun, what I would add to that, in the fourth quarter, we guided sales mid to high single digits. And as you know, historically, what it tells you is our paint stores group will be in the high end of that range. We will have some price in there from October and November, but you certainly are seeing volume in that forecast as well.","Arun Viswanathan","And then, on coating, on Performance Coatings, what\u2019s your expectation on the cadence of margin recovery there? Do you expect these price increases to gain momentum next year? And ultimately, when do you think you can get that segment back to where it should be?","John Morikis","Yes. I don\u2019t think we are going to have to wait till the end of the year. Although the largest majority of it will likely come towards the end of the year. We are as we\u2019ve talked before, very determined in our efforts here in. And we are going to start seeing -- we will start to see some of that benefits here in the fourth quarter, largely after the first quarter. There will be some due to some agreements that may lag even into the beginning of the second quarter but the largest part we should see the recovery back in the first quarter of next year. But, we will see some here in the fourth quarter.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Evans","This is Chris Evans on for Bob. I was wondering if you could tell us how pricing shaped up in the third quarter for paint stores group. And then, also in the third quarter, was pricing positive across much of Valspar portfolio?","John Morikis","Yes. So, in the price increase for stores, our paint stores realized about a 2.5% effective price increase in the third quarter this past year from the 3.5% -- 3, I\u2019m sorry, 3% to 3.5% price increase effective December 1, 2016. And Chris, we existed the quarter at a slightly higher run rate than that. So, implementation of our October 1st price increase here that we just announced is in progress. And we expect the timing and effectiveness to be similar to the December increase, roughly about nine months with 75% realization. It\u2019s fair to say, we\u2019re obviously experiencing some margin compression across most of our lines in our businesses, which really isn\u2019t unusual in an inflationary cycle, like we\u2019re experiencing, but our pricing philosophy in the other segments is basically the same. When we see raw materials inflate, we pass the increases to the market in the form of these price increases. And the difference in some cases in timing between the businesses, we\u2019re going to work with our customers to pass the raw material costs through in a manner that is least disruptive to their businesses. But, we\u2019re out there working every day, very hard to ensure that our customers are successful, and these discussions are going very well. We\u2019re working with our customers in a way that allows them to absorb that but we also are very firm in our need to get the price increase.","Al Mistysyn","Chris, I would just add, on Valspar, as we talked about on our second quarter call, Valspar had knocked out with price in the first half of the year. We talked about the six to nine-month lag that typically occurs in those businesses. And we\u2019re -- as John mentioned, we\u2019re out with price but we saw minimal impact on price in our third quarter as it relates to Valspar. ","Chris Evans","Great. And maybe just touching on the Consumer Brands a little bit. You mentioned in your paint stores group, DIY volumes were up high single digits. How did they fair out in the Consumer Brands division, maybe specifically in the big box retailer and then any other commentary you could give on how that division shaping up, would be helpful? ","John Morikis","So, first, to if you look at that business, let\u2019s say a business made up as you would expect of a number of different pieces and parts. And when sales were down, we mentioned that there were a number of elements or drivers behind this softness that we experienced, and so, as you would expect those number of drivers here there are leading the improved performance that we have here, most notably I would say would be our European business. In the past, we\u2019ve talked about that business was down in the high teens through the first half and that declined to mid single digits here in the third quarter. Some of this improvement would clearly be -- we have a more favorable currency comparison, but I\u2019d also say that our order volumes were better in the third quarter than the first half as well.","Our national accounts business here, which is the largest customers segment that we have here, those would be the home centers, national hardware, other big box format, was essentially flat year-over-year in the quarter. That would suggest inventory adjustments by some of our larger customers were less prevalent here in this quarter that were just coming through. And while these signs are encouraging, as you would expect, we have higher expectations from our team. And while we are pleased with the momentum, we\u2019ve got confidence in this team, the leadership that we\u2019re going to continue to see momentum, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused on, is making our customers more successful what they are trying to do.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess, sticking with the raw material theme, I know it\u2019s early, but can you give us a sense of how your raw material cost basket is tracking for 2018, based on what you know at current?","Bob Wells","Ghansham, this is Bob. We normally give the 2018 raw material outlook at the end of the year, simply because our vantage point is better at year-end, and that\u2019s particularly true here and the reason being that as you all know, Hurricane Harvey disrupted a meaningful amount of the global chemical supply sector, and that caused some short-term shortages and tightness in a lot of the feed stocks. The fact of the matter is at this stage, we don\u2019t know what short-term means. And moreover, there are some things we do know. We know that the availability of a lot of the monomers are improving but MMA in particular continues to be tight and is likely to be tight through 2018. We know that the global TiO2 market remained tight and that has facilitated price increase announcements in late second quarter, early third quarter and against the fourth quarter they captured a fair amount of the 2Q, 3Q increase. We\u2019re somewhat skeptical of their ability to capture the fourth quarter, but whatever they capture in second quarter, third quarter, obviously is going to carry into 2018.","But the big question is, how much of the impact -- the short-term impact of the storms on the petrochemical sector are going to carry over into 2018 and we just don\u2019t know that yet. We think the raw material basket at this point is tracking year-over-year in about the 6 to 6.5% range. And if you assumed that raw materials were stable from here through 2018, that would put you in the low to mid single digit inflation range.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Bob. And then, just as my second question, the $0.26 you called out for transaction and integration costs for the third quarter; where does that specifically flow through on a segment income basis? And also, at the analyst day, you called out $2.7 billion in EBITDA pro forma for fiscal year 2016, what does that number look like for fiscal year 2017 if you exclude the transaction and integration costs.","Al Mistysyn","The impact on the acquisition costs are flowing through admin, which would be about $187 million of that and the rest, the amortization inventory step-up that Jane talked about would be in the Performance Coatings Group and the Consumer Brands Group. When you talk about the EBITDA and looking out, the 2.6, which was the combined entity, if I look at core Sherwin, you\u2019re looking at an EBITDA of over 2 billion, 2.1, 2.2 billion. Valspar, historically has run about a $630 million, so a 2 billion plus the 600 gets you to 2.6. And right now, obviously I think you understand, we\u2019re running little bit behind that for partially here seven years but in 2018 you\u2019d expect us to pick that back up as the price increases that John talked about take effect and as the synergies flow through. And like I said, we\u2019ll give you an update on 2018 synergies on our year-end call.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","John, you mentioned that you\u2019ve maintained the midpoint of your guidance flat, it\u2019s $15, but obviously that\u2019s after $0.35 hit from the storms in Q3 and I assume some hit in Q4 as well. So, I guess versus where you were on your second quarter call, what\u2019s gone better than expected to offset or more than offset that storm impact?","Al Mistysyn","Yes. Don, I think we\u2019d start with the sales momentum we saw in our U.S. and Canada paint stores. As we talked about in July and August -- coming out of July and August, we were running comp stores at 6.7%. As John talked about, coming out of the storms, we see that momentum continue along with the price increase that stores implemented and the effectiveness we are seeing that from October 1st; it\u2019s helping that. And obviously, Don, with the 22% increase on core; that tells you that we are expecting gross margins to improve sequentially third quarter to fourth quarter. So, it really -- that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving our guidance and why we feel strong about it.","Don Carson","Okay. Then just to clarify on paint stores group. You said John that price was about 2.5% of that 5.2% same store sales growth. What is it on a year-to-date basis? And how should that price unfold with the second initiative that you had another 3% to 5% increase on October 1st?","John Morikis","So, it\u2019s around that 2 to -- maybe speaking of 2.5, Don, but probably closer to 2, and we expect that rollout in this recently announced price increase to be very similar to what we have just experienced.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Byrne","Couple of questions on Consumer Brands segment. Would you say you have more potential to push price in these legacy Valspar brands than in legacy Sherwin brands? And then, in Lowe\u2019s, what can you offer them to maintain that combined sales base of the Sherwin and Valspar brands? Does it need to be rationalized? And what would you do to avoid a shelf space shift to a competitor?","John Morikis","Steve, what we look at constantly is our ability to help our customers meet their goals, as I mentioned earlier. And so, when you ask, what is it that we might do? It\u2019s helping our customers to be more successful. We are having discussions with them on a regular basis, not just Lowe\u2019s but every customer that we have. That\u2019s our path to success, is making our customers successful. Regarding price, we don\u2019t talk about price outside of our own stores. We have discussed the fact that we have clearly seen the raw material basket move and so that we\u2019re out talking with customers in all segments of our business about the need to push pricing in but we are not going to talk about any pricing and any specific customer. But I\u2019m going back to your point of what is that we do with our customers, as Lowe\u2019s or any other customer that we have on that side of the business is to help them be successful.","Steve Byrne","And do you have aspirations to penetrate the other big box retailer out there?","John Morikis","Well, again, we have discussions with our customers on a regular basis. We are not going to talk about any one customer. But our goal is to clearly understand what our customers\u2019 expectations are. We got terrific brands, products, people and services. And if we can help demonstrate to them an ability to help them reach their goal, then, we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019re rewarded.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Parkinson","Can you just talk a little more about the regional housing trends you saw in PSG, especially as it appears some other regions offset some of the September weakness in Texas and the Southeast? And then, you\u2019ve seen a few housing markets with lower short-term availability but some higher prices. Can you just reconcile your own views on home prices versus turn over trends? Thanks.","Bob Wells","Yes. Chris, this is Bob. I would say that despite the fact that turnover has been slow due to lack of available inventory, remodeling has been very strong. I mentioned at our financial community presentation that as much as 20% of the residential repaint has historically been driven by existing home turnover. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at this point in this cycle. We think a higher share, the remodeling activity is being done by stay in place home owners and driven at least in part by rapidly rising home equity. While we would like to see more inventory available, we would like to see stronger turn over, it doesn\u2019t seem to be dampening the rate of residential remodel and repaint activity.","On the new residential side, it\u2019s been a really pretty strong story, despite the fact that there are constraints to the market in labor and land availability. Single family starts are up about 9% year-to-date and completions are up a little more than that, new homes sales are up high single digits and home builder orders at least as of the second quarter were into the double digits. So, the new residential market of which we have substantial share is driving significant growth. Even in non-residential and I know you didn\u2019t ask about that but non-residential, we\u2019ve been seeing mid to upper single digit growth in starts, in square footage under construction and a little stronger than that in completions. So, all of the drivers of our paint stores group pro business appear to be, I wouldn\u2019t say firing on all cylinders but certainly strong enough to drive the kind of volume growth that we\u2019re seeing.","Chris Parkinson","Great and just a quick follow-up. There has recently been a little more optimism within some, let\u2019s say, key general industrial parallels within the legacy Val portfolio. Have you actually seen some improvements or would you just characterize yourselves as still cautiously optimistic? Thank you.","John Morikis","Are you talking about the Valspar general industrial?","Chris Parkinson","Correct.","John Morikis","Yes. I would say, we\u2019re very positive. Our team -- our leaders that lead that team have really been very bullish about, not only the core Valspar business but the sales synergies of those two business coming together are really exciting. So, yes, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re feeling bullish.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks. Maybe just following up on that and just looking at the Performance Coatings Group, your Sherwin profit was down a lot this quarter and your sales aren\u2019t growing as fast as they\u2019re obviously at Valspar. So, you talked about the synergies between the two business and some issue there, but what\u2019s it going to take to get the margins in better shape, assuming a lot of that\u2019s raw materials?","John Morikis","Yes. It is raw material. And so, pricing is going to be an issue. If you look at our year-to-date margins, they are much more respectable. We had some pressure in the third quarter. And as we talked about, while we don\u2019t call out specifics with any specific customers, I would tell you that this is an area where our raw materials have moved and we\u2019re out talking to our customers to get the increase. But as Al mentioned earlier, I think it was Jeff Zekauskas\u2019 question regarding volume of the Valspar and our core business. Our volume in this business is very good, it\u2019d be a different story, if we had volumes stream in the other way, but we\u2019ve got volume. We just need to be able to get the price to offset the raw materials and we\u2019re feeling good about our ability to do that. As I mentioned, the discussions have largely taken place; it\u2019s a matter of timing before we start to receive it.","Vincent Andrews","And then, maybe just on -- and it\u2019s small for both companies, but the auto refinish business there\u2019s been some noise out there amongst the competitive set, just challenges with distributors and pricing issues, is there anything unusual going on in your business, related [ph] to that business core?","John Morikis","Yes. I wouldn\u2019t call that out in any negative way at all. We\u2019re out having pricing decisions there, we\u2019re working hard again to help our customers be successful. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I\u2019d call out that\u2019s unique about that business right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Harrison","In the paint stores group, if I take your 6.5% number for July and August, and then look at the overall performance for the quarter. It looks like September may have been 2 to 3% same store sales growth month overall. Is that about right and can you walk through what those same store sales numbers look like across the different U.S. regions or North American regions, in the month of September?","John Morikis","I\u2019d say directionally, you\u2019re heading in the right direction. And I don\u2019t know that we give specific numbers by region, Mike. But, I\u2019d say that if you back out the storms, our Southeast, Southwest divisions have really been lighting it up and little bit of competition between the two of those to see who can lead the race, but all of our divisions including Canada, all of them are doing very well. Look at the progress that we\u2019re making. We talked about this last year when we were coming out of the second quarter that we were really focusing on new account activity and on share of wallet penetration. And I know we talked about this when we were together that that\u2019s really been a focus. And we are absolutely witnessing the benefit of this program. Our leadership teams there and our teams in the field are really executing, and we\u2019re feeling really good. So, I wouldn\u2019t call out any one division as lagging outside of the storm impact.","Mike Harrison","All right. And then you mentioned the residential repaint business up double digits. Does this mean that contractors have been able to add some labor and expand their capacity during the high season? And then, what does that mean for the same store sales growth as get into the low season or the slower season where we have kind of seen better same store sales growth over the past couple of years in the Q4, Q1 quarters? Thank you.","John Morikis","So, the momentum that you\u2019ve talked about, I believe this will be the 15th quarter of double digit gains in the residential repaint. And so, we are continuing to capture we believe a little more than our share. I lost the last part of your question though...","Bob Wells","On the lower ends of our sales curve. So, Mike, I think what you\u2019re going to see is that you saw it in our first quarter, we had a 7.5% comp on top of a 9.4% comp in the first quarter of 2016. And as our guidance suggests, mid to high single digits will tell you that our U.S. paint stores have to be in the high end of that range on top of 5.5% comp last year. So, we definitely are seeing higher percentage increases in our off quarters, if you will.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts","As we model the cash flow, the capital spending was only $60 million in the quarter that annualizes I think to a much lower rate than either pro forma or regular target is on an annual basis. Could you comment about why it was so low and maybe what the next couple of quarters look like or next year?","Al Mistysyn","John, I think our CapEx for this year will be about $200 million to $210 million. What you see is, it is a little bit lower run rate. As we get to the facilities and understand more about what they are doing, their capacity utilizations, we have talked about having capacity utilization, architectural in the Valspar sites. So, you won\u2019t see us spending capital for capacity expansion that maybe we have over the last few quarters. I would say, we are really working on 2018\u2019s plan and we will give you an update at our year-end call. But, I still think we are going to be in the target of 1.6% to 2% is still a good target. And like I said, we are working on the 2018 plan and we will give you an update.","John Roberts","And then, in the back in the reconciling slide, you got the operating segment comparison and Valspar coatings was up 8.5% year-over-year in there, something must have been up double digit, now was packaging coating or coil coatings in major areas, up double digit in that Valspar coating segment?","Al Mistysyn","Yes. We saw some nice progress in general industrial, John talked about the bullish outlook we saw, also some nice movement in our industrial wood business, and that\u2019s specifically in Asia. So, yes, across the board, we saw increases but those would be the ones that kind of led the way.","John Morikis","Yes. I\u2019d say, the wood business was certainly strong in Asia, but having just spent some time with our wood team at the market here, I would say we are starting to see some nice progress in number of parts of the world, not only Asia. We have some good momentum there.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Rednor","I wanted to ask about DIY within the stores. I think you called out high single digits, John, and I think that\u2019s the strongest DIY number you turned in four or five quarters. So, is there anything unique there or just curious f you could elaborate?","John Morikis","Scott, actually, if you look at the performance that we had in DIY throughout -- actually through 2016, we are in the mid single digits throughout the quarter. First quarter this year, we were up mid single digits. It was actually the second quarter of this year, we are actually flat, second quarter, and then as you mentioned here in the third quarter, high single digits. Some interesting parts there, we\u2019re always trying to keep our fingers on the pulse to know exactly how the consumers acting and why. And I wish I was smart enough to know exactly why they are but we do know that there are some economic factors that might drive home owners to hire a painting contractor. We talked about those. Those could be driving the same thought process and to driving consumers into a specialty paint store where they want a high quality finish, and they may not want to reach all the way down to painting contractor to do the work but they want to try to get as close to the finish as possible, and so they are turning to a specialty store like ours, where the quality of products and services will help them reach that.","Bob Wells","And Scott I would just add to that that the real difference between the mid single digit growth that we saw all last year and the upper single digit growth we saw in the third quarter was price. Volume growth was pretty consistent. ","Scott Rednor","And Bob, just also on the P&M that flows through the paint stores, is that now trending positively?","Bob Wells","Yes, it actually is. In fact, we commented that we\u2019ve seen that business go positive early in the year, in the first and second quarter. It continues to show -- to build momentum through the third quarter. Our third quarter was stronger than second quarter. We credit that to both our success in as we called it pivoting to key markets that are showing growth like bridge and highway, water and waste water and some of the others, and improving conditions in the end markets that have been in steep decline, particularly oil and gas. And I should point out that our Protective & Marine business was also positive in Latin America in the third quarter.","Scott Rednor","And then, just quickly, Al what are you taxing the amortization and integration cost at? I assume it\u2019s a little bit higher than the tax rate across entity.","Al Mistysyn","Yes. It\u2019s about 30%.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn","All my questions have been answered, but you guys have expanded your presence outside of the U.S. So, maybe it\u2019s worth revisiting, what the foreign exchange impact has been on the revenue, both in the Latin American Group as well as in the Consumer Brands and in the Performance Coatings. I\u2019m assuming there is not much change in the Canadian dollars, so this shouldn\u2019t be much of an impact in the paint store group.","Al Mistysyn","Yes. Dmitry, you\u2019re correct. It\u2019s very -- it\u2019s minimal across tag. It\u2019s really basically flat or not -- no impact on Latin America and we had a 1.5% tailwind in Performance Coatings.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. So that\u2019s helpful. And in the consumer group it was also flattish?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, really no impact.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Because I know you picked up some Australian and Chinese and UK business with Valspar\u2026","Al Mistysyn","Yes. The impact on Consumer Brands was really related to the devaluation of the pound related to Brexit, and we\u2019ve annualized that. So, in the quarter, there has really been no impact on Consumer Brands.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Got it. Okay. If you look at your Latin American profitability, it\u2019s kind of been all over the place. And I\u2019m just wondering in both in interest of understanding what\u2019s going on in the business and then sort of forward forecasting. How much of that profit variability has been a function of volatile foreign exchange where you just -- you price a product and then the currency moves on you or how much of it has been sort of either difficulty in growing the business or perhaps raw material inflation that was outsized for some period? There just doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of reason to the quarterly performance on the margin side of that business.","John Morikis","Yes, Dmitry. It\u2019s largely to your point than impacted by the raw material costs. We\u2019ve had TiO2 coming in from Asia that has spiked up. So, when you would expect to have some benefit, maybe from FX standpoint, you get the impact of rising raw material costs coming into the market as all products coming in there for the most part have come in at a higher price this year. So that\u2019s largely been in the impact.","Dmitry Silversteyn","So, if I\u2019m looking at sort of the profitability of that business quarter to quarter, you seem to put up kind of positive profit margin for most quarters but then we had a big 9% decline or so, or my math\u2019s -- a negative margin in the second quarter of this year, which correspond to about a 7% decline or 7% negative margin in the second quarter of last year. So, is that just a second quarter thing that you would put up a negative margin within a good year?","Al Mistysyn","No, we don\u2019t\u2026","John Morikis","We don\u2019t allow negative things\u2026","Al Mistysyn","No, I think Dmitry, you definitely -- as specifically Brazil, which is over half of our business and the economic issues they\u2019ve had, as that continues to get better, we will see choppiness in our quarters. But, our expectation is that we will continue to improve over the midterm certainly and get the business back to profitability on a more consistent basis, so you don\u2019t see these quarter to quarter swings.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Got it, got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, final question on the -- I know you guys can\u2019t talk about it explicitly, but PPG did say on their call that they\u2019re working with their big box partners to try to move pricing, given what\u2019s going on with raw materials now for the second year in a row. Is that something that you -- I\u2019m assuming you have the same initiative and we should start thinking about perhaps a little bit of a positive price in the DIY channel, not just Company-owned stores?","John Morikis","Dmitry, I\u2019ve broadened it across the entire Company. I\u2019ve tried to be very clear with this that it\u2019s a very good question and one that we\u2019ve tried to be as open as possible. And that is that we try every day to bring value to our customers. And when the raw material basket has moved like it has, we\u2019re in front of our customers talking about the need to stay whole in that, and that\u2019s across all customers, all segments.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Sison","In terms of 2017, you gave us core EPS with Valspar and on [indiscernible] $16.57, your guidance to midpoint 15, what does that imply for EPS with Valspar in a whole for 2017?","Al Mistysyn","If I understood, Mike, you\u2019re talking about our full year guidance at $15 with Valspar. Valspar will contribute about $0.80 to that and the guidance, and then that tells you that our core or legacy Sherwin EPS at $14.20 would be up 10.5% compared to last year\u2019s $12.85, if I answered your question correctly.","Mike Sison","Just relative to the $16.57, which you gave at the analyst day, which is annualizing Valspar for the full year, what does that number equate to for 2017, based on your $15 guidance?","Al Mistysyn","It\u2019s very hard to give you that number based on guidance when you\u2019re talking about all the puts and takes and the impact that Valspar has on pricing and the raw material inflation. So, what I would tell you Mike is that we\u2019ll give you an update for the full year 2018 with Valspar and we can kind of give you an impact certainly, the interest expense on the new debt impact. So, it\u2019s hard to get a comparable 2017 versus 2016.","Mike Sison","Okay. And then, just a quick question on October price increases. Does that cover potential inflation that you may see in 2018?","John Morikis","Well, it\u2019s certainly based on what we believe to protect us through 2018 but we are as determined as we can get it right, but we don\u2019t necessarily always know the future. I would say that we don\u2019t feel as we\u2019re in a similar market to what we experienced in 2010 through 2012 where if you recall, we were out with six price increases in 22 months. So, we are going in with what we believe will cover us. But, I think we have demonstrated through our past practices convection and determination to protect our shareholders.","Bob Wells","I do think it\u2019s also important to point out that we were out communicating about our October 1st price increase with our customers before Hurricane Harvey made landfall. So, the impact on the petrochemical sector of the hurricanes that hit at the end of August and early September were not contemplated in that price increase. But, as I indicated earlier, we think a lot of that -- the cost increases as a result will be short-term in nature and we will just have to see how 2018 unfolds.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Mushkin","A lot of my questions actually have been answered but I wanted to broaden out a little bit. At the analyst day, you guys were really pretty bullish about the outlook and I just wanted to [indiscernible] obviously took place a long ago. But I just want to see kind of gauge or temperature about a month later and still feeling it\u2019s bullish in general about your business and the outlook going forward. And I suspect maybe answer is yes. And then, as you look at it and again over the next year or two as you bring these two companies together, what\u2019s your biggest concern both, from a macro perspective and then also internally to the things we trip up. So, two-part question here.","John Morikis","Scott, so, I would say, nothing has changed about our view of the world. Any bullishness that you felt continues and we feel -- I would say this way that we are more bullish than ever on this deal from both the strategic standpoint and from a synergy standpoint. This transaction is value-creating on many levels. And we are thrilled with where we are. We are thrilled with the people. We are thrilled with the products. And most importantly, we are thrilled with the customers. So, we are very excited about where we are and where we are going. The second part of your question was concerns and what might\u2026","Scott Mushkin","Not even specific to deal, the outlook looks really bullish on the deal. As you guys look out, what do you worry about though? Is it cost inflation that\u2019s your biggest worry? I guess, I\u2019m just trying to -- both Valspar in mind but also in general.","John Morikis","Cost is something that we deal with. We don\u2019t like to deal with it. But, as I just mentioned on our last call that I think we have demonstrated an ability to put price in where we have to. I would say, the macro shock to the economy or some disruption of some sort that would really impact the economy on a larger scale. But right now, if you would speak to any leader inside our company, we have got a strong line of where we are going, what we are trying to do and a lot of determination to be able to do it. And that gives us confidence that we control our future and we are focused on executing to be able to win.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","PJ Juvekar","We know that the DIY market is weak. Are the big boxes trying to getting more contractors in the stores and are you seeing more competition from that side? And then, you talked about the shortage of contractors in the U.S. for last couple of years. Are you guys doing anything proactively to address that issue?","John Morikis","So, I would say, first, your question about the home centers activity and to the pro business, I would say that that\u2019s always been an element of the market and one that we respect. I would say that with our customers and the focus that they have on sub-segment of that pro business where we can help them, we are determined to help them do that. In many cases, those are remodelers that are no typically in our stores and if we can help our customers to grow that business, we want to try to help them. ","Bob Wells","On the labor shortage. ","John Morikis","On the labor shortage, it\u2019s interesting, the largest percentage of the business that feels the labor restriction is in the new residential, commercial and industrial business. Some in the residential repaint but again given our 15 quarters of double-digit gains, I would say that many of our customers are finding a way to find the labor that they need. In those other areas, while we\u2019ve been working with a number of areas to try to generate more supply of labor, the reality is, is that if in fact we were successful and we could find painting contactors or labors that could help our painting contractors. In many cases, they would still be on the job waiting, waiting for the drywallers to finish, the roofers to finish, I mean electrical, it\u2019s a much more macro issue than just the painting contractors themselves, the much larger issue. And so, while we\u2019re trying to help in a meaningful way, it\u2019s a bigger issue than just the painting contractors.","Bob Wells","I would add to that that for decades, we\u2019ve been helping contractors with labor issues by creating products that make them more productive. And it has been the focus of our R&D effort for a long time, is to get contractors on and off the job faster; that also helps in cycles where they are labor constrained. Using more productive products and formulas can help them do more jobs in less time. ","John Morikis","As well as less of a requirement to come back, touch up better or be more consistent in what they are trying to do to help them get off the job quicker as well. So efficiency and stay off the job. So, it\u2019s good point, Bob.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you with that. And just lastly, how much benefit could you possibly see in 2018, from all the reconstruction that would take place in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, which are all your core markets?","John Morikis","It\u2019s really hard to quantify that. Different types of storms and different areas were affected in different ways. In Florida, while we really took a substantial hit in the number of stores that were closed, there was some flooding. In some areas, we don\u2019t want to minimize this at all; our hearts go out to those that are affected by the storm. Fortunately, many of the areas were impacted with some water damage that could be fixed relatively quickly and then there were others that were significantly and more horrifically damaged. And those will be a longer term cycles to get back up. In Texas and in Puerto Rico, there was more damage. A smaller market, while those areas will build themselves back up and we want to help those communities, our employees and those that live in that area. It\u2019s not going to be significant enough to move the needle. And so, we\u2019re going to be there to help in any way we can but we don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s going to really drive our results.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard","Thank you. On the consumer segment, I appreciate the progress and growth results in 3Q relative to Q2. But thinking about the path forward for growth in that business and I heard the comment on some efforts on price but what are you doing and what should we be thinking about in regards to the growth out of that piece of the business?","John Morikis","Yes. So, Eric, as you would expect, we\u2019re engaged with our customers; that\u2019s not something that we lay out typically in a call like this. What you should expect is that those discussions take place regularly. We\u2019ve got we believe terrific assortment of technologies, people and service to help our customers win but from a strategic standpoint, we don\u2019t want to lay those out here today.","Eric Bosshard","In terms of the destination with growth, is there is a goal or\u2026","John Morikis","Eric, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t hear you.","Eric Bosshard","Yes, sorry. In terms of the destination with growth in that business, can you give us a little bit more there? I understand the strategic piece of it, but in terms of like what growth out of that business are you looking to get back on a sustainable basis?","John Morikis","Yes. I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve spoken that that business could be a low single digit growth run for us and we feel we can capture that. And quite frankly, talking to our teams our expectations are going to be higher than that. But we feel as though there\u2019s a lot that we can bring there. And we\u2019re really excited about the combined company and the assets, brands. There\u2019s a lot that we can accomplish we think. There\u2019s a lot of institutional knowledge on both sides of our company now coming together that we\u2019re going to try to leverage.","Eric Bosshard","But then secondly and you talked about a bit but just that level of conviction on improving the Performance Coating margin through pricing. Again, I know you\u2019ve only had the Valspar piece of the business for a period of time, but the confidence level of being able to make that happen as we go into 2018, where do you stand on that?","John Morikis","I\u2019m not sure how to convey the conviction or confidence any higher than -- we\u2019re going to get that Eric. We\u2019re out there having those discussions right now. We don\u2019t expect ever to just have something that we don\u2019t deserve. We\u2019re working hard. We\u2019re working hard to improve the quality, the availability, service, people, every element of our job there. And those discussions have taken place in many cases and it\u2019s the matter of timing. There are some that continue in dialogue and discussions but the largest part, those discussions have been resolved. And as I mentioned, you should start to see some of that in the fourth quarter. But, the lion\u2019s share of it come in as we turn the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Morbelli","I was wondering if you could talk about the trend in architectural paint and other businesses you have in China following as a five-year big meeting by the heads of the country.","John Morikis","So, we feel as though in China, we have a terrific platform to continue to grow and perhaps even better leverage. We do feel as though the technology, as I just mentioned and I think that discussion may have taken as a more North American focused discussion. But, when we\u2019re looking at this consumer business where we talk about all the markets that we participate in now, so when you look at that market and the brand that we believe can be better leveraged, we are excited about supplying not only the technology that exists in our combined company around the world but there is a lot of institutional knowledge that we want to bring to that market as well and to take advantage of the opportunity that exist in the market. Our market share there, I\u2019ll just say, there are plenty of opportunities for us. So, we are working with our team to identify those assets that exist inside the Company that can help them better perform in the market.","Rosemarie Morbelli","And then looking at investor day, you increased the synergy level. And as you look at Valspar more closely, what is the likelihood that we will see one more bump in that particular projection? And will it take until the end of 2018 or do you think that you are getting your arms around all of the manufacturing facilities and what you can do or we could actually see it before year end?","Al Mistysyn","For the full year, let me just start that -- we talked about seeing about $15 million going through our P&L and we haven\u2019t come off that forecast. However, what you saw is increase in our forecast for cost to achieve synergies in 2017, which as John talked about it in his comments was the result of some facility closings we announced in our third quarter. We really won\u2019t see the benefit of those until late next year or early to 2019. But I would tell you we are going to increase our expected annual run rate synergies at least for this year to $160 million versus 106 that we had talked at the end of our second quarter. Your are probably going to have to wait until our year-end call to get an update on the $280 million run rate synergy that we talked about at the financial community presentation.","Rosemarie Morbelli","And then, lastly, if I may. Could you help me allocate the charges between cost of goods and SG&A as a [indiscernible] going into the different segments or an EPS basis?","Al Mistysyn","So, if you look at the cost to achieve and the acquisition or purchase accounting cost, you would see in the third quarter about $87 million of that was in gross profit, primarily related to the inventory step-up. And then, you saw the rest of it or about $119 million, $120 million in SG&A related primarily to the amortization expense on the intangibles.","Operator","Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. So, I would like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.","Bob Wells","Thank you, Jessie. As always, I will be available over the next few days to answer any additional questions that arise as you digest this morning\u2019s call. If you\u2019d like to be placed in the queue for a follow-up call, please call Kristy Johnson at 216-566-3001, and she will add you to the callback queue. Again that number is 216-566-3001.

After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions.","I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Jessie. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations, April 20 Press Release. You will also notice as we go through our results for comparison purposes, our first quarter 2016 results have been restated to reflect the adoption of ASU 2016-09.","I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for first quarter 2017 compared to first quarter 2016. Then comment on each reportable segment.","Consolidated net sales increased $187.4 million or 7.3% to a record $2.76 billion driven primarily by higher paint sales volume in our paint stores group. The change in revenue reclassification adopted last year increased consolidated sales 2.2% in the quarter. Currency translation rate changes did not have a significant impact on sales in the quarter.","Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $81.4 million or 6.5% to $1.34 billion. Our consolidated gross margin decreased 40 basis points in the quarter to 48.6% of sales from 49% last year.","Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $13.8 million or 1.4% to $1.02 billion in the first quarter, but decreased as a percent of sales to 36.8% from 38.9% in the same period last year.","Interest expense in the quarter was roughly flat to last year at $25.7 million.","Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $90.2 million or 41.7% to $306.6 million due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group and Global Finishes Group.","Our effective tax rate decreased to 22% from 23.8% in the first quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017 we expect our effective tax rate will be in the mid to high 20s.","Consolidated net income increased $74.3 million or 45% to $239.2 million. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 8.7% compared to 6.4% in the first quarter last year. Currency translation rate changes did not have a significant impact on net income in the quarter.","Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 44.6% to $2.53 per share from $1.75 per share in 2016. The $2.53 includes $0.08 dilution from the acquisition-related expenses and $0.34 accretion from the reduction in income tax provision.","Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2017 increased 12.1% to $1.81 billion from $1.62 billion last year. Paint Stores Group sales increase was due primarily to higher organic paint and equipment sales volumes across all end markets and the impact of the change in revenue classification. Comparable store sales that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months increased 7.5%. The change in revenue classification is not reflected in comparable store sales.","Implementation of the December price increase has also been successful thus far. Regionally, in the first quarter our Southeastern division led all division followed by the Canadian division, Southwestern division, Midwest, and Eastern Division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division.","Segment profit for the Group increased $50.5 million or 20% to $304 million. Segment operating margin increased to16.8% of sales from 15.7% in the first quarter last year.","Turning to our Consumer Group first quarter sales decreased $40.6 million or 10.7% to $337.5 million due primarily to lower volume sales to most of the Group's retail and commercial customers.","Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $3.4 million or 5.3% to $60.6 million in the quarter from $64 million in the first quarter last year. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 18% from16.9% in the same period last year. Most of the improvement in the first quarter segment profit margin was from improved operating efficiencies and good SG&A expense control.","For our Global Finishes Group sales in U.S. dollars increased $16.2 million or 3.6% to $470.3 million in the quarter. Currency translation rate changes did not have a significant impact on sales in the quarter. First quarter segment profit stated in U.S. dollars increased $3.9 million or 8% to $52.4 million due primarily to higher paint sales volume and selling price increases that were partially offset by higher raw material costs. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to11.1% from 10.7% in the same period last year.","For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales stated in U.S. dollars increased $16.2 million or 12.9% to $141.4 million primarily due to selling price increases and favorable currency translation. Currency translation increased sales in U.S. dollars by 5.7% in the quarter.","Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased to $1.2 million in the quarter from a loss of $900,000 last year. Segment profit was aided by selling price increases which were partially offset by higher raw material costs. Currency translation had a minimal effect on our Latin America Coatings Group segment profit in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit increased to 80 basis points in the quarter compared to a loss of 70 basis points in the first quarter 2016.","That concludes our review of our operating results for the quarter. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. John?","John Morikis","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.","First quarter 2017 was a good quarter for Sherwin-Williams from both a revenue and profit perspective. But there was one obvious exception and as our nature, I'm going to address it first.","Our Consumer segment had a bad quarter. There are two reasons I feel it's important to address this upfront. One because I don't want you to think that our strong consolidated results diminishes the urgency we feel to address the challenges this group faced in the quarter. And two, because you need to know that nobody is more disappointed in how this quarter unfolded than the women and men responsible for driving this business. Consumer sales in the quarter were weak in most product categories across most market segments in most geographic regions all three months of the quarter. This was not the result of soft sales to one customer or one product line. We were comping against the first quarter 2016 load-in of the INFINITY product line at Lowe's and I wish the explanation for the weakness this year was that simple.","I believe Consumer Group saw the flip side of the obvious strength in the professional paint market reflected in soft DIY demand in the first quarter, but they will remain focused on expanding our retail presence and driving sell through. You also need to know that I have the utmost confidence in this group. I know they will rise to the challenge. You should expect better results from our consumer segment over the balance of the year.","The positive momentum we saw in our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter last year accelerated in the first quarter. Sales to residential repaint contractors continued its double-digit growth trajectory followed closely by sales to new residential painters, property management contractors, and commercial contractors. Equally encouraging our pro customers continue to report large project backlogs. Protective and marine coating sales and volume turned positive in the quarter, but lagged the pace of growth in architectural paint.","During the quarter, paint stores group added 10 net new stores while this pace is slower than first quarter 2016, the difference is entirely attributable to timing issues.","Our plan still calls for full year store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations compared to 94 opened in 2016. Today our total store count in the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean stands at 4,190 compared to 4,099 a year ago.","Latin America Coatings Group delivered high-single-digit revenue growth in local currencies in the quarter, although down volumes were still recovering in most countries in the region. As market demand fully recovers, our management teams will continue to make progress on managing operating expenses and mitigating raw material cost inflation.","Global Finishes Group delivered solid top-line growth in the first quarter with revenues up across all businesses and volumes up in most. Once again, the group did a commendable job of managing both gross margin and SG&A resulting in a cycle high 11.1% first quarter operating margin, 30 basis points better than first quarter last year.","We continue to see positive demand momentum in many of our industrial coatings businesses in North America, Latin America, and Europe and this team is well-positioned to flow through revenue growth to profit improvement. To get a more accurate picture of our profit performance in the quarter, you need to back up the effect of the two accounting changes we adopted last year plus the acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these items, consolidated gross margins increased 50 basis points to 49.6% of sales. SG&A improved to 37.2% of sales compared to 37.7% last year and PPG margin was 11.8% this year compared to 9.8% last year.","Our reported tax rate in the first quarter of this year was 22%. If you back out the tax benefit from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 our effective tax rate would have been approximately 33%. Net income would have been $214.1 million, an increase of approximately 25% and earnings per share would have been $2.27 per share, up 25.4%.","Net working capital increased slightly year-over-year as a percent of sales to 11.5% compared to 11.2% first quarter last year as accounts receivable and inventory both increased to support the strong sales momentum early in the year. In dollar terms, the increase in working capital was $97 million in the quarter compared to an increase of about $80 million in the first quarter last year. Despite the higher March 31 year-over-year working capital, we generated $231.8 million in net operating cash, an improvement of more than $290 million compared to the first quarter 2016 due primarily to the increase in net income and reduction of cash used during the quarter to service accounts payable compared to first quarter 2016.","Our capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $41.5 million. Depreciation was $44.6 million and amortization was $6.2 million and in 2017, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $230 million, depreciation of $175 million to $185 million, and the amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will continue to run higher than normal in 2017 as we complete investments and IT infrastructure, capacity, and new stores.","Our cash balance on March 31 was just over $1 billion compared to $890 million at the end of 2016. We will continue to build cash on our balance sheet over the coming months to reduce total borrowings required to finance the completion of the Valspar acquisition. Therefore we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury during the quarter and we'll suspend share repurchase activity throughout 2017. On March 31, we have remaining authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares.","Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share compared to $0.84 per share last year.","North American architectural paint demand should remain strong throughout the year, driven by steady increasing level of residential remodeling activity and to a lesser degree new residential construction. As we move into the prime painting season, we are also encouraged by growing signs of more robust non-residential activity and improving demand for many of our industrial products.","While growth in the U.S. Do-It-Yourself market will likely continue to lag the professional painter market, we expect positive sales growth in our consumer segment in the quarters ahead.","On our year-end 2016 earnings call, I said our expectations for average year-over-year raw material inflation was in the low-single-digits. Given the recent uptick in crude oil, relatively high propylene pricing in the first quarter, tight market conditions in certain key monomers used in the production of latex, and low TiO2 inventories, we now expect raw materials inflation to be in the mid-single-digit range.","The price increases we have announced to the market thus far in the year appear to be gaining traction and we have not made any additional announcements. We will however continue to monitor changes in the raw material environment and will respond appropriately to changes as we go through the year.","Our outlook for second quarter 2017 is for consolidated net sales to increase mid-to-high-single-digits percent compared to last year's second quarter driven in part by the revenue reclassification. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share compared to last year's record $3.99 per share. Our guidance range for second quarter includes acquisition-related expense totaling $0.25 per share.","As a reminder, second quarter 2016 earnings included $0.16 per share in acquisition-related expenses. For the full-year 2017, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2016 by mid-single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our full-year guidance to be in range of $13.65 to $13.85 per share compared to $11.99 per share in 2016. Our updated full-year 2017 earnings guidance includes $0.40 per share charge for acquisition-related expenses which is $0.40 less than the charge included in our initial full-year guidance. And an increase in the income tax provision benefit of $0.25 per share more than forecasted in our original 2017 EPS guidance. These two items account for all of the change in our full-year 2017 EPS guidance.","As a reminder, full-year 2016 earnings per share included $0.86 per share related to the Valspar acquisition and $0.40 accretion from the adoption of ASU 2016-09.","Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and now we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question is coming from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Parkinson","Thank you. Can you just talk a little bit more about the implementation of your PSG price increases and just a rough breakdown of how you think it's going between both short and long-term contractors, I'm assuming most short-term contractors have immediately accepted it. And then also is your expectation for the resin solvents and latex baskets sort of moderate in the second half and if not, it sounds like another price increase would be under consideration? Are we thinking about that correctly?","Al Mistysyn","Hi, Chris this is Al Mistysyn and I'm going to take the first part of your question related to the price increase in our Paint Stores Group. As a reminder you know the last price increase we went out was the first quarter of 2014. We announced the price increase in December 1, 2016 about 3% to 5% and while none of our customers like seeing their prices go up, they understood the cost environment, we are operating in and they're accepting that price increase and I would say that the rate of realization or effectiveness of that increase is slightly ahead of where we expected it to be.","Bob Wells","And Chris, this is Bob. Let me handle the question on raw materials, we often talk about the many moving parts of the raw material basket and as John indicated, we've seen a fair amount of movement in a number of areas since our year-end call. While our outlook for TiO2 in fact hasn't changed much. We still expect mid-to-upper-single-digit inflation for the year in TiO2. We are seeing more pressure in some of the petrochemical based materials. This is a result of a number of factors, most importantly; higher propylene cost in the first quarter higher than we expected in fact and tight market conditions, which we think are transitory tight market conditions in certain monomers in particular MMA and VAM. And while the effect of these petrochemical factors may be somewhat transitory and aren't likely to result in a runaway raw material basket, they have pushed our expectations up from low-single-digit to mid-single-digit.","In the first quarter, we think we were probably at the top end of that low-single-digit range may be in the 3% to 3.5% range. We do expect to see some incremental inflation in the second quarter. And we think that the year-over-year inflation is likely to peak in the second quarter. Then we start rolling through the price increases taken in TiO2 last year which the year-over-year inflation should ease somewhat in the second half.","Chris Parkinson","That's great color. And just a quick follow-up, can you give a little more color on your expectations for the Consumer Group on a go-forward basis, including any incremental growth spend you see key trends you're seeing in the big boxes and\/or any benefits potentially from a full year INFINITY we should be considering. Thank you.","John Morikis","Yes, so we don't talk about any specific customers so I'm not address the INFINITY directly. I will say that, as I mentioned earlier that the overall performance for the quarter fell short of our expectations and while we found ourselves in a situation where we felt there was weakness across the board. And it was a very challenging market. We just, we don't accept that.","And so the answer your question, our expectations moving forward to be the best partner possible to our customers. And that means helping them get product off the shelf it's not our desire to fill their shelves is to help them get product off the shelves. I don't -- I don't want to get into a lot of specifics on our strategy to be able to do that. I will say that our teams. We have great confidence in our teams. We've got and I think the terrific strategy. We are looking forward to the combined business once we close on Valspar we think added to assets together or the people, the brands everything will make us better and we're focused on every one of our customers and helping them to be more successful.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan","Good morning. First, I guess I just wanted to ask if you could elaborate on some of the comments you made on volume. You said that you are starting the see some improvements and in some of your markets. So maybe you can break that out on resi repayment and new construction and non-res and so on. Thanks.","John Morikis","Yes, I would say that we're very pleased in the stores segment's performance while we don't give specific numbers. I will tell you that the residential repaying once again had a double-digit gain. This will be the 12th of 14 quarters that we've had double-digit gains and we feel as though there is a terrific momentum. I've got that's great respect for that team and what they're executing on right now is just been terrific.","I would like to take you back to the second and third quarter of last year when we started talking about the challenges that some of our customers were talking about at that time which was their view of the world included a great confidence in the projects that they were working on and the bidding that they were doing, and if there was any concern in their comments, it was typically that they had more work than labor. And so while our residential repaying business has been growing for 12 to 14 quarters I have more confidence right now probably than ever because our team is really responded.","We're not exactly sure what the second and third quarter has in store for us as it relates to labor and any constraints that they, our customers might experience but we're not waiting and our teams have been working very aggressively and filling the pipeline with new accounts to try to offset any slowdown that our customers might have in growing their business. It's a matter of are they at capacity or not. The residential repaying we're very excited about and momentum. The others commercial, new residential, I mean it is, is really a very strong quarter of stores organization, in fact even protective and marine we had a couple years of softness in protective and marine through our stores. We had a positive quarter in sales of protective and marine and that some of the bottoming out of the oil and gas, but we've been talking about pivoting into different segments and trying to accelerate in those segments. We'd like it to be faster without exception but we're starting to see some momentum there.","Arun Viswanathan","Great, thanks. And just as a quick follow-up given the strong volume I would have expected a slightly higher margin but I understand that the odds were definitely a pressure. So maybe you can just discuss how you're thinking about gross margin relative to your typical ranges and how that should progress through the year. Thanks.","John Morikis","The gross margin, I think in our first quarter, we were pretty happy with that result on the core we saw a 60 basis point improvement. As the year unfolds as Bob mentioned, the second quarter, we expect year-over-year, raw material inflation to be -- to peak we're confident that we can recoup the inflation in the market. It just doesn't happen in real time and as we see that the rest of the year unfolds on the effectiveness of our price increase, where raw materials trend out at the end of the second quarter, we'll have a better line of sight to our gross margins and update accordingly.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi thanks very much. In the Paint Stores business, did your price increases offset your raw material inflation?","John Morikis","Yes I believe in the first quarter our effectiveness was better than we thought and more than offset the raw material increase.","Jeff Zekauskas","And are your raw material increases in the United States greater on a percentage basis than your raw material increases in the offshore markets?","John Morikis","Latin America will be higher, higher but across the rest of the globe, I'd say the U.S. the impact of titanium dioxide that has on our U.S. business is probably a little higher in the U.S.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And could you provide the gross profit changes in your division?","John Morikis","Yes. So Paint Stores Group increased $82.5 million, Latin America Coatings Group increased $4.9 million, Global Finishes Group increased $6.6 million, and Consumer decreased $10.2 million.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi","John, just going back to -- good morning Bob. Just going back to the protective and marine sales turning positive is that just a function of easier comparisons after several tough quarters or do you actually sense some more activity and optimism at the end market level? How should we think about that?","John Morikis","No, it's certainly some easier numbers, but I would definitely say that it has an equal if not more result of the efforts that our teams are putting forward. I think that we are seeing some benefit in the market, we're seeing some easier comparison and we're certainly witnessing some benefit of the pivoting into some of the other segments I spoke of.","Ghansham Panjabi","So that being said and going back to the first quarter an upside on earnings relative to your initial guidance what actually drove the bulk of that upside was it just P&M sort of a little bit better than you thought, pricing realization being a little bit better, or was it just the volumes in Paint Stores Group?","John Morikis","Volumes in Paint Stores Group were very strong and as I mentioned I could go on every segment just as much passion as I started with resi paint but each one of our segments have really shown terrific growth and we're feeling really good about it and protective marine wasn't the headwind that it had been in the past.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Byrne","Yes, thank you. How would you rank these potential drivers of the strength that you saw in volume in your Paint Stores Group potentially better than expected whether the backlog that your contract customers have a shift towards more of the pro contractor versus DIY versus just kind of backlog in resi repaint demand.","Bob Wells","Yes Steve this is Bob. I think if I would rank those items, the number one would be, as we've discussed on a number of quarters our customers, our professional customers are labor constrained in the high season quarters second and third much less so in the first and fourth. So we saw a rebound of comps in the fourth quarter that rebound actually accelerated in the first quarter, it tends to be their smallest volume quarter. So I think the fact that we're seeing a flattening out of volume in the industry from the traditional bell shaped curve to more volume in the out quarters that that would be number one.","I think number two is the shift from DIY to contractor. I think we are with rising home values, rising equity markets, increasing consumer confidence, a stronger employment backdrop all those things, the homeowners are really getting confident in hiring contractors as opposed to doing project themselves. One of the things that is driving incremental volume for us is by our own doing. It's not a market force, it's more our focus on new account activation on growing share of wallet amongst our small share customers is certainly driving volume growth in that segment and leading to what we believe to be a probably 2X plus rate of growth -- volume growth in paint stores of the 2X plus the market rate of growth. We don't think weather had an impact on the first quarter.","Steve Byrne","And then on the retail and commercial customer side of the business, would you say your volumes lagged overall volume growth in those channels and if so why?","John Morikis","Are you talking about in our stores organization, Steve?","Steve Byrne","No, through the retail and independents.","John Morikis","Through the consumers, yes consumer did lag and that's the comments that I made earlier, as far as we found some challenging markets and customers there is not one that I would point you to say that there was one customer, one geography, as I mentioned earlier, there was -- there were some challenges that we faced throughout nearly every market with many customers facing some tougher sales and our focus remains on helping them to be more successful.","Steve Byrne","I guess my point on that one John is, were you in line with the overall market or not?","John Morikis","It's hard to say, I don't. I will say that we didn't experience any shelf loss, we've not found ourselves in situations where we feel as though we've lost shelf to our competitors we're just really trying to focus on helping our customers sell more product off the shelf.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Gingrich","Thanks, this is Matt Gingrich on for Vincent. I was just wondering if you -- how the Do-It-Yourself sales in the Paint Stores Group trended in the quarter?","Bob Wells","A little softer than our pro business positive.","Matt Gingrich","Okay. And then in terms of the monthly cadence of the Paint Stores Group performance?","Bob Wells","In Do-It-Yourself as well or?","Matt Gingrich","No, just broadly.","John Morikis","I don't think there was a significant difference throughout the quarter.","Bob Wells","If you adjust for days.","John Morikis","If you adjust for days.","Bob Wells","Right.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Koort","John can you help us scale the non-architectural book of business through PSG and maybe the big components of that, so we can sort of think about those markets bottoming and what they might contribute as you come out of that down cycle if you will?","John Morikis","I would say the non-paint categories remain strong. And I'd say the growth rates are in line with paint demand; we're seeing good momentum in those -- in those categories.","Robert Koort","I guess in the industrial coatings that you sell through your Paint Stores?","John Morikis","P&M you talk Protective & Marine?","Robert Koort","Yes whatever else you would consider non-architectural paint?","John Morikis","I'm sorry; I thought you meant non-paint sorry. No, I think that as I mentioned Protective & Marine sales were up but not in the same range as our architectural category, so it's certainly in our expectation that they wouldn't go from a direct headwind to a strong tailwind. And so we feel as though, as I mentioned, it's bottoming out in the industrial businesses inside our stores and through a lot of effort and some of the markets improving, we feel as though it's going to help us. It won't turn into a terrific tailwind for us immediately though.","Bob Wells","And Bob that the Protective & Marine is really the only material non-architectural business in Paint Stores Group, the rest of that would fall in the Global Finishes.","Robert Koort","And then you mentioned just timing on the store count, but obviously if you're going to get up to 90 or 100, you got to start adding quickly in the prime paint season in front of you. So should we expect 30 or 40 units added in the second quarter?","John Morikis","Yes it's funny we had this discussion every quarter and we like to see those numbers little smoother. But as you would expect with just different construction regulations and ordinances it's just a little bit of challenge to smooth those up. Bob, yes, we're going to load up, we're confident in the year. And no one should read anything into the number little softer in the quarter than what we would have liked but it was truly just a matter of in some cases getting permits, occupancy permits we're on, we're on the same point, we should be ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","Thank you. John, I want to go back to the Consumer Group with are you seeing any destocking or inventory reduction at the big boxes, given that they're seeing lower overall levels of demand. And have you been able to get any price increases this year in from, from your Consumer Group customers.","John Morikis","On the inventory piece that's always something that we're trying to work with, with our customers. We want to as part of being their best supplier; we want to be the ones that can offer them the best service, so that they don't have working capital tied up in that. And so there is always in those discussions and I wouldn't say that to any greater extent, then we would expect or quite frankly that we would want. We want to help our customers in those terms.","In regards to pricing, we don't comment on the pricing on that side of the business. We've spoken to our stores and we've spoken to the raw material basket but we, because of the competitive nature of those customers, we don't speak to any specific customers outside of our stores.","Don Carson","Okay. And a follow-up on the overall market, you talked about how not only is architectural demand strong but you're seeing strong non-residential and industrial demand. I think last year you said the market grew 2.5% would you, it sounds like you're expecting higher growth in the overall market this year is that an accurate reflection.","Bob Wells","Hey Don are you talking about the U.S architectural market of the overall paid incumbent?","Don Carson","U.S. architectural market because it sounds like you're seeing some positive things on the commercial side of that as well.","Bob Wells","Yes and we've learned over the last couple years that the tale of the tape for market growth is going to be -- is going to be determined in the second and third quarter. It really depends on the labor supply in the professional painter market. We know that labor supply is growing, is it growing at the rate of demand growth doubtful. So to what extent market wise, labor is a constraint to volume growth this year time will tell. We think that the demand in the market is sufficient to drive industry growth well ahead of low-single-digits, well into the mid-single-digits.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Leithead","Hey guys it's actually Mike Leithead on for Duffy this morning.","Bob Wells","Hey Mike.","Mike Leithead","Hey Bob. Just want to come back to the commentary you made on strong paint stores volumes in the quarter. Is it fair to say you're seeing somewhat of a shift? I guess in your customer behavior to kind of compensate for the tight labor market in 2Q, 3Q. So may be the seasonal fall off in paint stores during 1Q and 4Q should maybe a little bit less so as contract just try to get projects on that are either pushed out or pulled earlier.","Bob Wells","I think you're right, Mike, I think you'll see some flattening of the bell curve certainly not an all exterior projects but where possible there is certainly going to be some products or projects that can get pushed out into the fourth quarter they may have been completed in the third.","Mike Leithead","Got it. And then a bit of a technical one here for my follow-up, so I apologize that, on the income tax provision accounting change you realized $0.34 benefit this quarter and now the new full-year guide assumes $0.45 benefit for the full-year. Where should we think about that remaining $0.11 being I'm assuming there is none in 2Q because you guys have been called out of your guide is that correct?","John Morikis","Well, Mike, what we've done in it typical practice in the past as we've annualized, these types of changes we start including them in our core and that's why we didn't call it out on our second quarter. I think what you see is if you look at how the adjustments rolled out in the quarters last year they maybe a little bit muted from a timing standpoint, but they're smaller and probably typical of what you'll see going forward.","I would say our first quarter was, was higher than what we are certainly expecting higher than last year and it was just a pure function of the amount of options that were exercised and the run-up in our stock price after the first -- our year-end call.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes good morning Thank you. You indicated that your SG&A ratio to sales was down about 210 basis points year-over-year. I was wondering if you could address what you're doing broadly to control costs and achieve that and specifically the extent to which you can address costs in anticipation of the Valspar deal and whether or not that is -- that is part of the tailwind there so to speak.","Al Mistysyn","Sure, Kevin if you go back and look at the sales out of our coming out of our third quarter last year, rightfully so the teams took action on SG&A with a reduced sales with an eye towards the risk of that and the de-levering we saw and we're seeing the benefit of -- benefits of those actions in our first quarter. And the expectation is that we'll manage our SG&A type until we get through the second quarter, we see the initiatives that John had talked about, about the new account activation, and how those are progressing and with an eye towards making sure that if labor constraints occur again in our third quarter like they had in the past two years we will be positioned well to overcome those. As far as an eye to Valspar that is absolutely a consideration. But I think we have a responsibility to manage our core and the operating margins related to our core and we'll manage the Valspar integration as soon as it closes and we're well prepared for that.","Bob Wells","And Kevin, a quick point of clarification the SG&A as a percent of sales improvement was -- was magnified by the change in revenue classification the revenue reclassification apples-to-apples comparison it was actually down 50 basis points.","Kevin McCarthy","Thank you for the clarification, Bob. And then second question I had was on pricing. You mentioned that your pace of realization exceeded your prior expectation. I guess two facets number one was all of the December 1 increase implemented by March 31 or is there a residual to come. And then second, given your expectation of higher raw's, again relative to last quarter. Are there increases recently announced or on the table outside of architectural in the balance of your portfolio. Thank you.","John Morikis","So, on the first piece, no, I wouldn't say that it's been fully executed. We're working with customers across all businesses on stepping those price increases in. On the second question --","Bob Wells","On the second question that we, we have gone out in with price in our other businesses. We don't typically talk about those on magnitude in that, but we have where we're certainly seeing pressure from a raw material standpoint.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Mushkin","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I had two. Want to dig into a little bit more on the consumer groups issues where you sort of backorder, obviously you're going to fix it. I guess I'm trying to understand. I think also says across geographies, across retailers that it was kind of across the board. I think you referenced some softness in DIY but looking at it a little bit deeper I was wondering you can give us a little bit more color on what you think you exactly led to such broad based conditions in that segment and how you fix it.","John Morikis","Yes, I mean little hesitant to do that, and only because from a strategic standpoint, I want to play my cards a little close to our best. I do feel though that it's fair to say that the teams that we have around the world, but particularly here in the U.S. because of the size of this business. Our focus on those areas as I mentioned earlier, I'm trying to help our customers to be more successful by selling more products rather than getting products in the shelf lane out the specifics on how we plan on doing that's something I'd rather show you the results and explain to you as we're working on these what we're doing.","Scott Mushkin","But how about what went wrong I mean do you think with specific to you guys or do you think it's just the weakness in the market. I mean where maybe some light there on what went wrong?","John Morikis","I mentioned that we have not experienced any shelf loss. I wouldn't say that we're -- we're feeling as though we're on the backend of any deals that went the other way but at the same time we're far from complacent, assuming everything is okay. We have -- we have very high expectations of our team and I do think that they found themselves as I mentioned in a challenging market. That said, we have higher expectations for ourselves and our investors should have higher expectations of us.","Scott Mushkin","Right. And just switching gears and goes to my next question is in the Paint Stores Group as we've seen -- saw last summer things slow down, some of that was labor but also there was this idea I think it came up in the third quarter that Do-It-Yourself is really just not all that robust and of course we're just having other discussion whether it's DIY market mostly. I mean how confident are you as we get to the second and third quarters you are particularly at third quarter which even the Paint Stores Group has more of a DIY component to it that we won't see the same slowdown, we have seen we saw last year?","John Morikis","Well as I mentioned and as Bob mentioned as well and we're now waiting to see last year's second quarter when we started to hear from our customers that they were concerned with their ability to grow their business. We started right then mobilizing our sales organization to effectively increase the number of accounts that we have an account activation program. So the good news that we see is that the fundamentals of the market are very, very strong, it's a matter of how much our customers can apply product and so many of them as we've said found themselves at capacity.","Well when you find your customers at capacity and you want to grow your business, you got to find new customers and so we've been working very, very hard at both the share of wallet customers that are currently in our store that offer more opportunity as well as customers that are in other locations buying product and we've had some success there. So we're not waiting for the second and third quarter to play out. We're taking steps right now to control our future and we'll see how effectively we're compared to what the constraints in the markets are. But we're not just waiting for things, good things to happen to us.","Scott Mushkin","That's great news. And then just one technical how big is DIY and Paint Stores Group in the third quarter is it proportionately a lot bigger and then on yield?","Bob Wells","Scott we've described DIY has been between 10% and 15% of the segment. It would be less than that; it would be smaller in the first and fourth quarters.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Rednor","John and Bob whoever wants take it. Just a question on that, given that you posted growth at DIY at the stores and that's a pretty big gap relative to what you're calling from mark in the consumer, how would you explain that differential?","John Morikis","Well few things, Scott first the DIY number that Bob just quoted as far as our percent of sales was a total year it's a first quarter is a relatively small quarter for us in DIY. There is a shift clearly there is a shift from do-it-for-me to do-it-yourself to do-it-for-me. But there is still an awful lot of opportunity for us to continue to grow our business. Inside our stores we talked to DIY consumer because it's an important component not only in trying to grow our business but the DIY is a relatively small piece, we want that homeowner accepting our product coming in the door with the painting contractor. So in the first quarter, while it was up slightly, I'd say it's a relatively small percentage of our business it is the first quarter.","Scott Rednor","And then I just wanted to ask about the approach to guidance, I mean even with that headwind on consumer and you think it's getting better stores came in better than you saw in the first quarter and you guys beat by $0.20 on a kind of a core basis. So recognizing you have ROTH coming up, can you may be just explain the approach so holding the full year stable even though you're coming out of 1Q better than you thought?","John Morikis","Yes, you're right, we are pleased with our results in Q1 and again pointing to stores and even our Global Finishes Group momentum, we feel good about that. We've got great confidence in our strategy and great confidence in our team, so that as I feel like I have repeated a few times here, it's important part of our culture here and Sherwin, there is no complacency despite the fact that we had a good first quarter.","But that said, and if you'll pardon a sports analogy I know you're a Yankees fan, but I'll use our beloved Cleveland Indians which we're very proud of. First inning of the game they may put a lot of runs on, on the scoreboard, but they don't start packing our bats after the first inning and so Scott, I'd say we're not packing our bat after the first quarter, we typically earn about I'd say between 15% and 20% of our full-year EPS in the first quarter and I'd say probably what else 65% to 70% in the middle two quarters.","Bob Wells","Yes.","John Morikis","And so in other words we make our year in those middle quarters so not to overuse it but after the first quarter we're not ready to pack up our bags and go home. We've often said here at Sherwin that here is a strong weak in July can make up for a weak month in the first quarter. So while we're confident in our outlook and we have plans in place to sustain our momentum throughout the year we prefer to wait until we get this second quarter under our belt before making any adjustments in either direction to our full-year guidance, lot of confidence but we just think it's prudent to, to see this through.","Scott Rednor","I appreciate that John. I hope the hot start for the Yankees continued to but and then just lastly, maybe just on the cash flow obviously is very strong and 1Q atypical that you generate any cash is there anything we should be aware of as we think about the full-year timing or some normalization.","Bob Wells","Yes, if you look at our cash benefit in the first quarter net income obviously grew very nicely. We did get the benefit of the cash flow hedge settlement in our first quarter that was about $88 million. And then if you remember, coming out of our year-end 2015 our working capital as a percent of sales was really low was 8.6% and then when you look at the impact of working capital on cash flow the change first quarter versus year-end so we saw a much bigger change in our first quarter 2016 than we saw in our first quarter 2017 due to the timing of payments. And so you won't have, you'll have that rollout, but it will be much more muted as the year goes on.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Sison","Hey guys, nice quarter. In terms of your outlook for industrial demand, it sounds like it's incrementally gotten better as the quarter unfolded. What are your thoughts there as you head into 2Q and Valspar closed here any general thoughts you feel even more excited on what Valspar could given they've got more industrial exposure.","John Morikis","Yes but we better, right we've sort of lot of money to get those yes, we're very excited about what they bring very complementary in nature. We have gotten those, some of the people inside Valspar deeper into the organization and we're just absolutely thrilled with the team their approach, their attitude. We're anxious to be able to exchange more information and, but we know that's right around the corner.","You're right, our feeling about how our team in the industrial side of our business has been doing has us feeling more bullish than we have in the past and that comes from a number of different areas. One is they have there was a question earlier, I think Greg asked about SG&A and our management of SG&A on the Global Finishes Group side, they've been managing that business very well. So, they're positioned quite frankly to be able to flow a lot of -- a lot of profit through our incremental sales. And the pipeline of customers that they've been working on line trials and the confidence that they have going forward has definitely improved. So we're feeling pretty good about that team and what they're trying to accomplish and likelihood that they'll get there.","Mike Sison","Great and then one quick follow-up for the Consumer Group if your team and plans are successful for -- would you expect sales to turn positive this year at some point in the given quarter -- earlier than expectation?","Bob Wells","No, Mike, I think if you look at our sales guidance again in our second quarter, mid-to-high-single-digits in that guidance, you have to expect that our Consumer Group will perform better than it did, certainly in our first quarter.","John Morikis","Yes, we've not lowered our expectations of that team.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts","Good morning. I guess I got one last minute to say that.","Bob Wells","Good morning, John.","John Roberts","On the Valspar purchase price premium I assume that you'd like to assign as much as possible to writing up finished inventory to market. Should we expect that you and Valspar are producing and holding as much inventory, inventories you can prior to closing so you can expense more of the premium in the first year.","Bob Wells","No, John, I would that is not the case. I think what you probably saw in our results we carry more inventory in our first quarter and the reason we did that as with the strong sales of our Paint Storage Group coming out of the fourth quarter and the momentum they carried into our first quarter. We wanted to make sure we continue to service our customers that a high level. So we ended up carrying more inventory on the Sherwin side and that\u2019s why you saw the working capital up a little bit year-over-year, but I would not say that's a driver of the inventory.","John Morikis","And John I know from our past discussions that you know this, but we couldn\u2019t coordinate anything like that with Valspar anyway. I mean that's on the other side of the wall. So we're not allowed to have those types of discussions.","John Roberts","Do you have any update to the amortization expense for 2018 or first 12 months?","Bob Wells","I do not we're still, we're still working through that valuation and again on that side it's really Valspar's working on that. And we'll see that as soon as the detail related to the valuation as soon as we close. But we're not in able to see all the detail related to step up and assets and the like as soon as we know, John, we will be out and giving you that information.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Well, I guess mine is the first good afternoon question.","Bob Wells","Good afternoon, Dmitry.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Couple of questions, first of all just, trying to understand your margin performance by divisions, you've had very strong growth obviously in volumes in the store group and that seems to -- with the offset price increase in the raw materials, it drove the margin up year-over-year, which I guess. What I'm struggling to understand a little bit is your Consumer Group where your revenues were down, your volumes were down. I don't think you've got price increases in there. Your raw materials were up and your margin were still up better than the point year-over-year. So can you talk about sort of what you're doing on the cost side or the mix side to allow you to get that margin lift.","Bob Wells","Sure. Dmitry first off, I think the team has done a nice job at reducing their SG&A in this environment. But the other thing you have to remember is our global supply chain runs through that segment and we're seeing nice operating efficiency improvements with the gallon that Paint Stores Group is producing in flowing through that group.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay so that so volume impacts from the paint stores. Okay.","Bob Wells","Right.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. And then my second question is that you really have spent a lot of time talking about your Global division, which is more industrial and more global as name implies. So can you provide a little bit more of sort of a granular color on perhaps some of the regions or some of the business lines or industries that have done well for you. I mean the mid-single-digit growth you delivered is a little bit higher than your averaged the last two, three years in that division.","John Morikis","Yes, you're exactly right now Dmitry and across the board, and all three of those areas. We saw an improved run rate. And I'd say we're feeling good as I mentioned just a moment ago about the pipeline of tests and trial runs that we've had continues to move in the right direction. We've been aggressive in the SG&A side on that business. And at the same time, we've been investing in new products and people that we feel can help drive our business forward.","And so I'd say that across the Group through the three different businesses we saw sales gains across all three. We're feeling good about the momentum that they're gaining as they as they go forward. And as I mentioned the number of qualified trial runs that we've been on, has improved. So we're feeling better going forward.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay, thanks. And then one last question, you mentioned the foreign exchange didn't have much of an impact on revenue growth in the first quarter. But I'm imagining it wasn't zero impact. So what was the foreign exchange contribution or the headwind in the first quarter on the revenues?","Bob Wells","I mean it was less than 0.1%","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Harrison","Wondering if you can address your marketing spend in the first quarter. Obviously, we've already talked a little bit about the SG&A declining as a percent of sales, and I'm wondering if there were any changes related to timing or spending on the marketing front?","Bob Wells","No, there were really no significant changes in the spending or timing, Mike. I'd say there were; as we look at SG&A, I think we've we have looked at those types of efficiencies where we might have had two different business units buying different products from -- from different suppliers or partners. I mean just the basics that you would have expected. But given some of the size of some of our spend it can be fair savings so and then we're looking at trying to be as smart as we can with our spend without impacting the face to the customer.","Mike Harrison","I was also hoping you could talk a little bit about the as you're moving towards closing on the Valspar acquisition, how do you plan to handle the Valspar brand at Lowe's obviously that's one that Lowe's and Valspar spent a lot of money on and that was a big marketing push but probably less efficient for both you and Lowe's to support both of those brands going forward Any thoughts on that?","Bob Wells","Well, sure we have a lot of thoughts about the value of that brand I mean that's tremendous asset and one we want to get behind. We help -- we think it helps us with all our customers certainly not just Lowe's but it helps us with current Valspar customers as well as customers that are currently buying Sherwin-Williams branded products as the technology that we have -- we purchased can be moved into other different brands or other different customers. But all of those -- all of those decisions always come back to what I mentioned earlier, which is working with our customers on helping them to develop the best plan to help them grow more -- grow more product going out of their stores. So you asked specifically about Lowe's that but it could be with every customer that we're going to have combined we'll sit down with each one of them and develop a plan and how to best utilize all the assets that we have.","Mike Harrison","All right. And then last one I have is on the Latin America business you opened 23 new stores in Q4 then you only opened three in Q1 can you provide any sense on where you expect the store count to be at year-end 2017 relative to the 342 that you had at the end of Q1?","John Morikis","I think what you'll see is we opened 47 new stores last year. I think -- I think you'll see a slightly lower number than that and it's based on timing in the markets and similar type of issues we run into in the U.S.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering if you could talk about the potential impact from big infrastructure bill coming up potentially.","John Morikis","We love big infrastructure bills. Our Protective & Marine team has a good position in many aspects of the structural steel, the bridge and highway, water-wastewater, pretty much across the board. So we have -- we believe a terrific product line an outstanding distribution model, which we can utilize various stores that are properly equipped to take care of our customers that terrific technical people and a wonderful sales organization. So we've got a good position there and we'd love nothing better to see spending in this area.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Have you included any potential gains in your current expectations for the year or it will be a bonus on top of whatever you're expecting now.","John Morikis","We have not included any specifics to any kind of an infrastructure bill.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay, thanks. And then if I may, you have given the June 21 as the date to close the Valspar transaction could the timing of that closer trends can it be sooner than the June 21?","John Morikis","It certainly can. Our expectation would be that it is most likely to close before the June 21 date, it doesn't, we have not given that as the date of close. So the agreement that we that that we had signed originally with Valspar provided for to a provision a three-month extension, it happened to land on June 21 that was the three-month extension. So our hope and expectation as we move through that process is that we'll be able to close before then.","Rosemarie Morbelli","And do you have the total CapEx number for the combined companies?","Bob Wells","Not quite at this point, Rosemarie. I think I mean we are both running around to a little bit over 2% in short-term. I would say that's probably going to hold but mid-to-long-term, we see that come down as a percent of sales.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.","John Morikis","Chuck?","Operator","Chuck your line is live; you may proceed with your question. We will move onto our next question which is coming from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Melich","Could you -- I think you said price, volume, mix were all positive. But could you give us a little more insight as to how much of that the Paint Stores Group comp was volume versus price mix?","Bob Wells","Yes, Chuck, we talked about getting good traction on pricing. I'm sorry Greg, we have talked about getting good traction on pricing so far in Paint Stores Group but the vast majority of Paint Stores Comp was volume.","Greg Melich","Okay. So I could assume that's like better than 5%.","Bob Wells","Yes.","Greg Melich","Will be the vast majority, great. And then a follow-up and maybe it's certainly around you touched on a little bit in Latin America and we were finally I think I heard in the prepared comments that we got top-line growth but the volume is now improving but less negative, did I get that right? And if that's so are there any markets where actually is up or maybe okay.","Bob Wells","I'm sorry, go ahead please.","Greg Melich","So just if you could talk a little bit about that, like volume in Latin America was still down but down less and just sort of highlight some of the markets that were outliers will be great?","John Morikis","Yes, so we have had a couple of markets there that have moved in the right direction from what both a sales and volume standpoint. We've had mix that we've had couple that have not broken to that line yet. I would say that even in those areas that we're a little under pressure, we still saw improvement in specific segments. And so we're -- we're feeling better about Latin America as a whole. We're now to the point after release screwing down the expenses there, we have invested a little bit of money in some of the things that we think will continue to drive business clearly will keep that on a short leash. But we don't break out by country or business unit down there Greg, but I would say that it's safe to say that we've had positive momentum in all of them, some of them are in fact, positive volumes.","Greg Melich","Great. But the volumes overall are still down, but just down less than they have been in a while.","John Morikis","They're just slightly negative, just slightly.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen East","Thank you. John, I'll apologize to you before I ask another consumer question. But as you looked at the monthly progression through the quarter, what it looked like and following on that, how much as you look in the forward quarters, how much of this is market recovery versus what you all are doing with specific actions?","John Morikis","I would say from a quarter-to-quarter, I'm sorry month-to-month within the quarter is there was choppiness; there was no trend that I could speak to that. And quite frankly that's a little why we were able to manage the SG&A as we did because we didn't see any traction earlier on in the quarter and so since the November, October time last year we've been really trying to manage the expenses on this business. Going forward, I'd say that the expectations that we have would have to include catching up on some of the business that we had expected to see already and it's going to be hard to say how much of that is market improvement and how much of that is some of the product that we had hoped would have been shipped prior to this moment actually getting shipped.","So it's going to be a little difficult for us to have that clean line of sight. Again I'd reiterate that and we're feeling good about the relationships that we have with our customers and not having experienced a specific loss of any space. We truly believe that working with our customers and this is what we have been working on to make them better is going to be the answer.","Stephen East","Okay, thanks. And then in the spirit of the first 100 days of the administration, your first 100 days with Valspar where do you all sort of rank order your focus areas very early on in the combination of the two companies?","John Morikis","Customer is number one always number one. We want to get in front of as many customers as we can. We've got a very detailed plan on how we approach this and we're anxious to get in front of those customers as quickly as possible.","Number two employees. We've got because of the line of sight of our customers is somewhat muted, we don't have specific customers to see we can't exchange that information. We have plans to be in certain business units to visit with those key customers but we do know where the employees are and so getting in front of those customers, employees, and working with them to really put them at ease on the exciting future that they're going to have with Sherwin-Williams would be second.","From there, there is a great deal of effort that has gone into the blueprinting of the businesses, how we're going to move forward in areas such as removing complexity, value capture, exchange of information, exchange of technology, and each business unit has mapped those out in great detail. Again there are limits in what we can exchange but there's a lot of things that we can and so we've had the right people engaged in the room in talking about what those priorities are and we've got that down business to business, line by line and we're very excited, if there's been any positive at all to this business taking a little longer to be combined than what we would have liked, it's been our ability to work in greater detail on some of the things that we may not have gotten to until month two or three. But with the additional time, we've been able to get deeper, where legally allowed.","Stephen East","All right. I appreciate the in depth on that. Thanks.","Bob Wells","Thank you, Stephen.","Operator","Thank you. It appears there are no additional questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Jessie. Back on April 3rd, we announced that we are rescheduling our financial community presentation from our original May 25 to October 3. Our intent all along this year was to focus the meeting on the details of the Valspar transaction and integration progress and needless to say with the delay in closing the acquisition, these details aren't going to be available on May 25. We think postponing the event to fulfill our original intent will be more valuable to you and the presentation will still be held at the Marriott Marquis in New York, we hope you can join us. Registration details will be emailed late summer and we look forward to hosting a great meeting and we thank you for your flexibility.","As always, I will be available over the next few days to handle any follow-up questions that arise as you digest this morning's call. I'd like to thank you again for joining us today and thank you for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time."],"18974":["The Sherwin-Williams Co.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, October 25 Press Release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the third quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2015, then comment on each reportable segment.","Consolidated net sales increased $127.2 million or 4% to $3.28 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and the impact of a change in revenue classification related to third-party service revenue and related costs. The change in revenue classification increased sales 2.3% in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales by 0.8% in the quarter.","Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $61.7 million or 3.9% in the quarter to $1.64 billion compared to $1.57 billion last year. Consolidated gross margin was 49.9% of sales flat compared to the third quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $64.5 million or 6.5% to $1.06 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.3% in the third quarter this year, up 80 basis points from last year. A portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses.","Interest expense increased $27.1 million compared to third quarter last year to $44.1 million. The vast majority of this increase was acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $15.1 million or down 2.7% to $535.6 million, due primarily to acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $4.6 million compared to third quarter last year.","Consolidated net income increased $12.2 million or 3.3% to $386.7 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 11.8%, compared to 11.9% in the third quarter last year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 27.8%. A comparable effective tax rate to 2015 would be 30.5%.","For full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30%s, excluding the impact of the accounting change. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 2.8% to $4.08 per share from $3.97 per share in 2015. The $4.08 includes $0.09 accretion from the change in accounting standard and $0.24 dilution from acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased earnings per share by $0.03 in the quarter.","Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the third quarter 2016 increased $140.6 million or 6.7% to $2.23 billion from $2.09 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, excluding the change in revenue classification, increased 2.1%. Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher architectural paint sales volume across most end market segments and the impact of the change in revenue classification. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter and Protective & Marine Coatings sales were a significant drag on revenue growth.","Regionally in the third quarter, our Canadian division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Southwestern division, Midwest and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division.","Segment profit for the group increased $10.9 million, or 2.1% to $518.3 million in the quarter, as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin decreased 100 basis points to 23.3% of sales from 24.3% in the third quarter last year.","For our Latin America Coatings Group, third quarter net sales, stated in U.S. dollars, was $156.6 million, up $618,000, due primarily to higher year-over-year selling prices that were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and volume declines. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by $12.8 million or 8.2% in the quarter.","Segment profit in the third quarter, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased $1.2 million or 54.6% to $1 million from $2.1 million in the same period last year. The negative impact from higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation was only partially offset by increased selling prices.","Currency translation decreased segment profit $3.6 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. As a percent of net sales, segment profit decreased to 60 basis points in the quarter compared to 1.4% in the third quarter 2015.","For our Consumer Group, sales decreased $8.7 million or 2.1% to $412.9 million from $421.6 million last year, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation and declining sales to certain retail accounts, commercial customers and in our European business. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment by $5 million or 1.2%.","Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $3.8 million or 4.3% to $92 million from $88.3 million last year, due to improved operating efficiencies and good SG&A expense control. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 22.3% from 20.9% in the same period last year.","For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased $5.4 million or 1.1% to $480.7 million in the quarter, as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment by $7.1 million or 1.5% in the quarter.","Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased $8 million or 14.6% in the quarter to $63.2 million from $55.1 million last year, due primarily to good SG&A expense control. Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $0.5 million in the quarter. As a percent to net external sales, Global Finishes Group segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the quarter compared to last year.","That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So, I will turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year.","John?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our results for the third quarter include a number of unusual items that affect our revenues, expenses and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our results on a comparable year-over-year basis showed modest improvement. Consolidated sales increased 1.7% to $3.2 billion. Consolidated gross margin was 50.9%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. Operating profit improved 1.9% to $591.8 million. Profit before tax grew 3.9% to $572.4 million, a 30 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Net income increased 6.2% to $397.9 million and earnings per share increased 6.5% to $4.23 per share.","These results are consistent with the GAAP guidance ranges we provided for both revenue and earnings, but they fell short of what we envisioned at the start of the quarter.","Revenue growth at the lower end of our low single-digit to mid-single-digit range was disappointing. And the ongoing investments we are making in new stores, sales territories, retail merchandising, advertising, training and store service weighed heavily on earnings, particularly in light of the slow revenue growth.","Our sales trend by quarter so far this year is similar to last year with growth decelerating each quarter as we go through the year. At this point, it is unclear whether the mid-year slowdown in sales over the past two years is a result of labor constraints in the construction trades or an indication that the housing cycle is slowing, which is contrary to what most of the data would suggest, or something else entirely. Whatever the reason for the slowdown, our response is the same. We will continue to make prudent investments in the things that drive our long-term growth and profitability.","Architectural paint sales through our Paint Stores Group once again significantly outpaced revenue growth for the segment as a whole. High single-digit growth in the new residential and residential repaint contractor business was partially offset by a modest, but unexpected year-over-year decline in DIY sales.","Sales to commercial and healthcare customers also generated solid year-over-year growth, while the Property Management segment showed modest gains. The outlook for continued growth in residential markets over the balance of the year and into 2017 remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends, reported by most of our contractor customers.","On the other hand, the revenue headwind from our Protective & Marine business in Paint Stores worsened sequentially in the third quarter.","During the first nine months of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 69 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations, completing our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the year still calls for the store openings in a range of 90 to 100 net new locations. To-date, our store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,141 compared to 4,048 a year ago.","Finally, the upward inflection in input costs and operating expenses that we've seen in the recent months, including raw materials, wages and benefits, rent expense and more, warrant a price increase by our Paint Stores Group. Effective December 1, 2016, our Paint Stores Group will be implementing a price increase in the 4% to 5% range across most product lines.","We also anticipated a stronger sales performance from our Consumer Group coming into the third quarter. We saw widespread weakness across our commercial, industrial and MRO customers. Our Ronseal brand business in Europe also had a soft quarter. Despite the weaker than expected sales results, the Consumer Group continued to show good progress on margins in the quarter.","Our Global Finishes Group did a commendable job of managing both gross margin and SG&A in the quarter, resulting in a 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest sales declines. We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and in Asia.","Finally, our Latin America Coatings Group reported positive revenue growth in the quarter for the first time in 12 quarters. Despite this improvement in revenue and volume momentum, margin pressure from raw materials and higher SG&A spending continue to challenge our profitability throughout the region.","Third quarter was a strong quarter for cash generation. Net operating cash in the first nine months was $966.5 million, up about $64 million over last year, with third quarter accounting for about $456 million of the total. We're on pace again this year to generate net operating cash at a rate above 10% of net sales. We were at 10.7% year-to-date, despite higher working capital.","Nine-month working capital ticked up slightly to 11.5% of sales from 11.1% last year. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends was $560 million compared to $557 million last year. Our capital expenditures year-to-date totaled $173.1 million. Depreciation was $128.3 million and amortization was $20.2 million.","In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovations projects.","During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for Treasury. On September 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016.","As a result, our cash balance at the close of the third quarter 2016 was $702.6 million compared to $91 million on September 30, 2015. Last week, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year.","The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the balance of the year remains positive, and we expect to see steady improvement from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset to some degree by continued weakness in Latin America. Over the balance of the year, the input cost tailwinds are likely to turn to headwinds and the slower pace of sales growth is unlikely to fully offset our investment in new stores, territories and retail programs already in place.","For the quarter, we anticipate our core consolidated net sales will increase a low single-digit percentage compared to last year's fourth quarter. At this anticipated sales level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share. Fourth quarter 2016 earnings per share include costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar totaling $0.71 per share and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.03 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, fourth quarter EPS will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.23 per share compared to $2.12 per share earned in the fourth quarter of 2015.","For the full year 2016, we expect core consolidated net sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage compared to full year 2015. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance for full year 2016 diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.30 to $11.40 per share.","Full year 2016 earnings per share includes costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar, totaling approximately $1.35 per share, and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.40 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, full year EPS will be in the range of $12.25 to $12.35 per share, a 10% increase at the midpoint of the range over the $11.16 per share earned in 2015.","Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment briefly on the other press release we issued this morning. Last week, our board of directors elected Al Mistysyn to serve as our next Chief Financial Officer, a position held for the past 15 years by Sean Hennessy. This change will take effect January 1, 2017.","I'd like to close my comments with a few words about my great friend, Sean Hennessy. My relationship with Sean spans our 30 years together at Sherwin-Williams. He has always been an excellent advisor, contributor, and importantly, friend. We've traveled around the world together on many occasions and Sean has regularly impressed me in so many ways. So, it's no surprise that Sean has once again impressed me with his selfless decision to do what he believes to be right for his family.","Sean's decision to step down from the day-to-day responsibilities of CFO in order to provide more time and flexibility to address family priorities is yet another example of the quality individual we've all grown to respect.","We appreciate his willingness to stay on as Head of M&A activities, to provide support for the Valspar integration planning process, and to ensure a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities.","This past year, I've spent more time with Sean than any other executive on my team, travelling with many of you, to immerse myself in this important aspect of my job, and to gain as much information as I could from Sean, knowing this time was coming. Well, it's never a good time for a high performing executive like Sean to leave such an important role. The timing of his decision sets us up well for the year ahead.","Now, Mistysyn's promotion to CFO is the natural conclusion of a long, careful and thoughtful development plan to prepare him for this position. Al has been Sean's right hand man, and the architect of many of our financial programs and successes. Al is my choice for this important position. He is a proven seasoned executive and I'm truly excited to have him on my side as we move forward.","We've assembled a full Valspar integration team that has been hard at it for several months now, with Al actively involved on a daily basis. We're also in the process of building our operating plans and budgets for next year, with each of our segment teams and having Al on my side for these important meetings is crucial to his fast start.","With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much. Can you guys just add a little more color on the key trends throughout the quarter both from an end market perspective and geographic perspective. And how that rolled through Europe, PSG, same-store sales comp. And then also, if you could comment just very quickly on any margin differential pertaining to the reclassification of revenues? Thank you.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes. So initially, I would maybe add sort of this way. We did see high single-digit growth in our new residential and our residential repaint business. We saw a solid year-over-year increases in our commercial and our healthcare businesses, and modest gains in our Property Management. As I mentioned, just a moment ago, we did see a modest decline in DIY, and our P&M worsened sequentially. So, our outlook obviously remains very positive. We see the fundamentals of the business are very solid, and have great confidence in the investments that we're making that we're going to continue to be able to grow market share. We talked \u2013 actually Bob just covered geographically about the growth with Canada leading the market, and talked about the different geographies. So, I think we captured that in the comments just a moment ago.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes, Chris. And importantly \u2013 this is Bob. Importantly, we mentioned that the Eastern division was down the most and it's likely that that was at least some weather impact, because they had inclement weather in the quarter.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Hey, Chris, this is Al Mistysyn. I'm going to talk about the revenue reclass. And I'll just talk about it broadly, and then talk about the impact on the operating margin. But, we use third-party contractors to complete a variety of things for our customers. Previously, these immaterial amounts were netted and then included in the SG&A. We determine these buildings to customers should be grossed up as sales with a payments contract as included in cost to goods sold for a net immaterial impact on gross profit while reducing gross margin and operating margin. So, no impact on the consolidated dollars, but excluding that revenue reclass and the impact of the acquisitions, our operating margins would have been up slightly.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you. And then just very quickly, within the big boxes, can you just comment on any key trends you saw during the quarter between DIY and DIFM? And whether or not are there any major puts or takes based on your new products specifically INFINITY? Thank you.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Well, we prefer to let our customers talk about the trends within those areas. We do work very hard to work with them, to support them, and we're proud of that INFINITY product. We think it provides a terrific technology for an important customer of ours, but we'd prefer to let them comment about their specific results.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Fair enough. Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. You suggested that you're going to increase your paint prices here in the stores as of January 1, 2017. Is that the limit of your price increases or are there other areas where you plan to nominate increases for 2017?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","We made it a practice, Jeff, to talk about our stores pricing. We prefer not to talk about pricing outside of the stores organization.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","And, Jeff, this is Sean, I just want to \u2013 you mentioned January first, so I just wanted to put on your radar, it's going to be effective December 1.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","That's right.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. I'm sorry about that. Okay. Is there also a revenue readjustment to come in the fourth quarter from your accounting change or is it taken care of in the third quarter?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes, Jeff, this is Al. We did the adjustment because it's immaterial on a perspective basis, so the third quarter only has a third quarter adjustment, the fourth quarter will have an adjustment and then we will make a first quarter and second quarter of 2017, so the full year 2017 won't have any impact.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Okay. Thank you so much. And the fourth quarter adjustment is something of the same magnitude as the third quarter or it's different?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","It will be similar.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And in general, the revenues are offset by increased cost of goods sold.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good. Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good morning. Sean and Al, congrats, and, Sean, you'll obviously be missed by all of us.","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Hey. Thank you. I appreciate that.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thank you.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So I guess going back to same-store sales for PSG, just kind of being erratic over the past few quarters, you're obviously bullish on the outlook. I guess, John, what are customers, in particular, sharing with you in terms of why growth has been so choppy quarter-by-quarter?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Your point is a good one. The confidence that we have, we believe is built on the fundamentals of the market and we continue to believe that investing in this business is going to be a key part of our success, but the contractors that we've spoken to continue to believe that there are plenty of opportunities ahead. I mentioned the residential business that we saw growing, nearly double-digit increase in residential repaint over 9%. And speaking to these customers about the constraints that they feel as a result of the labor has had an impact on their business.","So, we're confident in this model that we have. We're continuing to invest in it. We believe that the investment in our stores, reps and products are going to continue to allow us to continue drive that operating margin. We're going to have a good operating margin improvement this year. We expect to have a good operating margin improvement next year, and we think that the fundamentals of the market support the contractor base that we're focused on.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just...","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Ghansham, this is Bob. Let me fill in that based on our volumes by quarter, it appears to us that the third quarter is the busiest quarter for contractors. So, if there is labor constraints in the market, it would most likely show up in the third quarter, or it would show up more in the third quarter than even in the second quarter.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, for just sticking with PSG and same-store sales, if you stripped out Protective & Marine, can you give us a sense as to what their same-store sales would have looked like? And then, on P&M, are we, John, sort of, at least in your perspective, close to realistic bottom for this business? Thanks so much.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes. I'll take the first piece on the bottom of the P&M. We do feel as though that we're nearing bottom. This has been a tough road here with the oil and gas predominantly under a lot of pressure. We have, as I mentioned in previous calls, worked to pivot our efforts into accelerating in other segments where we've been focused on for many years, but we expect to be able to accelerate our sales in those areas. The fact is that the oil and gas is a big part of our business. It's been an area that we've been focused on for many years, and we've had significant success, and it's had an impact on our business as it's slowing down. But, we're continuing to growing in areas within oil and gas, as well as some of these other areas within Protective & Marine.","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes. And if you look at the comp stores, I don't have it exactly, but it would be in the mid-single digits.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thanks for confirming.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Great.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Ghansham.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Bob, a question on the overall market. I mean, we've seen lower growth from other companies who've reported in the architectural space as well. So, just wondering, snapback that we are all expecting this year, because it \u2013 you know, easy weather comps from last year. Did that not materialize or whether there's some volumes that were brought forward in a very strong first quarter you had? Just wondering what comments you'd have on the overall market growth?","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes, Don, in John's prepared remarks, he talked about the sales trend or the sales trajectory by a quarter being similar this year to last year. And we think that's a reflection of the market overall. We're seeing that, that year-over-year growth tends to slow as we go from even second quarter to third quarter sequentially. And we're not sure if that's the function of market capacity or it doesn't feel to us like it's a change in demand trend. Our customers are still reporting very strong order book volume, and so it doesn't feel like third quarter jobs were pulled forward into first quarter and second quarter. It just feels like we're seeing some constraints in the rate at which contractors can get on those jobs.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes. The overall tone from our customers remains very positive on the architectural side.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And then a follow-up on your guidance reduction. Is that driven primarily by volumes or how much of a role did raw materials play, you know, are raw materials now going to go \u2013 be up more than you expected for the industry in 2016 and what's your outlook for 2017?","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I'll take the fourth quarter. I think it was driven by the volume side. I don't think that the raws are materially different than what we took a look at.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. On raw materials side, Don, we think it's likely that the raw materials will swing from a low single-digit tailwind in the third quarter to a low single-digit headwind in the fourth quarter, but we've kind of being guiding to that all along. We've said that the benefit from raw materials will diminish as we go through the year. The headwind, if there is one in the fourth quarter will be primarily driven by modest inflation in TiO2. The TiO2 producers got some traction on both their second quarter and third quarter price increases during the year \u2013 or during the second quarters and third quarters.","So, we haven't put together an outlook for 2017 yet, but fourth quarter 2016, it's going to be flat to \u2013 raw materials are going to be flat to up low single digits.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Thank you.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Good morning, Arun.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Congrats, Sean.","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thank you.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just I guess I wanted to follow up on the growth question. Over the last several years, we've seen Paint Stores Group kind of grow 1.5 times to 2 times the market. This quarter, it looks like the 2% growth is kind of in line with the market. Is that a fair assessment and is there anything that changed that led to this kind of performance? And then also in Consumer, it looks like the 2% decline is kind of bit below, and you just discussed that a modest decline in DIY, maybe you can just help us understand what drove that?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes. I think it's a bit early to tell if there's the issue with market, I don't think we have enough data right now to know how our growth in the market compared to our competitors. Our third quarter last year showed the same sequential softness, as Bob mentioned before rebounding in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And as I mentioned, we believe that the growth that we saw in the architectural side in residential repaint and new residential, a very high strong performance, the solid year in commercial and healthcare that I mentioned as well as the modest gains in Property Management, we still feel as that we're growing share, and most importantly I would say would be the fundamentals, the position that we have in the marketplace with the contractor continuing to outpace the market and our positioning there and our continued investment there is what gives us the most confidence. These stores that we're adding, the reps that we're adding, the new products that we're adding as well as our core locations we believe will allow us to continue to grow our share.","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","When you ask about the Consumer Group, again our Consumer Group this quarter was negatively affected by the European businesses as well as some of the commercial, industrial and MRO that are also embedded in there. So if you look at the North American architectural business, we were pleased with those results.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","And if you back out the European business, our North American business was positive.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just as a quick follow-up on the price in raw materials side, usually you take pricing I guess in the beginning of the year. Is there a reason that you kind of pulled that forward, you discussed the low single-digit headwind. But presumably, if you're announcing it December 1, you won't see that in Q4. So, is it safe to assume that that'll start flowing through in Q1 or what's the cadence on realizing that pricing?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Well, I think it speaks to what we've spoken about frequently which is, when we know, we typically go. And the fact is that, the last price increase as you know that we took was in the first quarter of 2014. Many of our operating expense categories have risen since then, our wage and benefits, our store rent and presumably, as Bob just mentioned, we're going to see some raw material increases. And so, we knew it was time for a price increase and we decided to go ahead and move on it.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good afternoon and good morning. Within Paint Stores Group, obviously, the results were below your expectations. And you outlined the different sub-segments of it. But it wasn't clear to me, which one of those came in below your expectations. You talked about high single-digit residential; doesn't seem like it would be that. So, was it DIY, was it the healthcare or Protective & Marine, what went wrong?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Well, I think obviously our DIY with a modest decline was clearly below our expectation. For Protective & Marine, we still have high expectations for this team. We recognize that a big percentage of the business is growing in this oil and gas. But we are focused on a number of these other segments. And we have been involved in these other areas and our expectations for all our teams are to continue to improve. So, I'd tell you that even our residential repaint up in nearly double digits, our expectations are that we want to grow faster. So, clearly some of those underperformed to a little greater degree in the DIY and P&M, Protective & Marine that I mentioned, but it's safe to say that our expectations are we want to grow faster in every one of those segments.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, just a follow-up, internally, as you guys assess the weather impact on any given quarter, do you have any particular means by which you do that? I mean I think about a hurricane going up the Gulf Coast \u2013 sorry, up the East Coast in September. Then we had another one in October for the fourth quarter. So, how do you guys think about assessing the impact of lost painting days or even 4th of July moved a day during this quarter from a Saturday to a Monday? So what is the impact of that type of stuff and is it worth speaking about in advance to the extent that we know about it?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","We don't like to talk about it, to be truthful with you. I mean our discussion internally as you mentioned is that we've got shareholders with high expectations, and we've got to find a way over the hill. And yes, we had to close stores in areas that were affected, but we're not leaning on that. We have a determined effort on this side of the call to continue to drive and improve. And quite frankly, it's something that we don't want to point to. We know it was there...","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","...but we have high expectations of ourselves.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I appreciate that. I'm not looking for excuses. I just want the explanation and it might be helpful going forward just to understand the change in results, particularly as they get more lumpy. But I'll pass it along. Thanks very much.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Vincent.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, good morning, fellows.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Good morning, Duffy.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Good morning, Duffy.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Question just as you think through the incremental margins, sales were down in both Consumer Group and Global Finishes, but yet income was up. So what was happening there that you were able to drive better income results than revenue results?","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Duffy, this is Sean. I think it really goes back to just the lumpiness, the question that we asked earlier I think, as John said, when you look at the year-to-date, I think that just the way different sales and SG&A comes in, in these different areas. So, I think when you take a look at the full year in Global Finishes back in 2014, the operating margin was 9.7%, last year it was 10.5%, this year through the first nine months it's 12.3%. So, we look at it more that way.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes. And I'd add this to it, Duffy, that organization, that team is doing a terrific job as well I think, at looking at opportunities, back office expenses where we can take some synergies through the organization. They've also got a strong focus on customers and positive mix of products. So, we knew that this was going to be a challenging year for them, and they went into it with the right frame of mind that we had to show improvement, and we had to pull a number of different levers to be able to get there. And they're working hard to do just that.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","And then on Consumer Group, a similar trend. If you look at 2014 operating margin at 17.8%, going to 19.6% last year and up 40 basis points year-to-date, they're doing a nice job of controlling SG&A and getting operating efficiencies with the volumes that we're generating through Paint Stores Group.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then on oil and gas, when was the peak of your oil and gas sales, and what's the magnitude of the headwind do you face revenue-wise since that peak?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I don't know of the exact timing of the...","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I think it very externally (43:27) correlates to the price of oil. I think...","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes. I was just going to say it.","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes. I don't know the exact date, but I think as the price of oil came down, the CapEx spending began to decrease and I think \u2013 and that's why we're in the situation we are.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes. So, obviously impacted by the CapEx spending that Sean talked about and as we mentioned the opportunity to pivot into some of these other areas. Infrastructures is an area that the team is focused on as well as some of the other segments within our focus there. So, plenty of opportunity here; some heavy lifting to do.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, fellows.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thank you, Duffy.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Good morning, Bob.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","John, I was wondering if you could talk about, are there prior precedence where you've taken up price in the stores that there has been pressure in the DIY channel and I guess I ask that in the context of your major DIY competitor talked about increased promotions and rebates and those sorts of things. So it looks like maybe there is some pressure on price through DIY. So, what's your thoughts about historically being able to push through the stores prices if the broader DIY market might be under some pressure?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Bob, I've been in this industry now, coming up on 32 years and every day of my experience has been competitive. We work hard in what we do to add value to our customers. And as I mentioned, a piece of this, we expect will be raw materials, the other components that we have invested in to be able to supply our customers with a greater value are key drivers for our ability to put a price increase in, and we don't take that lightly. To your point, we know it's competitive. We've got to be able to demonstrate a value to our customers. And so, the combination of our products and our services have to make our customers more money of what they do or we don't deserve the business. And we understand how competitive it is out there. And so, we're investing in the right things to better position ourselves to better help our customers.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Makes sense. And then let me ask if I could on the \u2013 Bob Wells, I think you talked about low single-digit raws' inflation. John, you mentioned 4% to 5% seeking price in your stores business. How should we think about the gross margin path into 2017?","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I think that 2017, when you look at it, we're very focused on operating margins, as you know, you've been with us for many, many years. And I think over the last three years-plus, the gross margin has been driving those margins. I think that we all know that the gross margin is not going to be as robust when it comes to year-over-year. I think that we're going to continue to do things for efficiencies in the plants and warehouse. The price increase to make sure that the gross margin is somewhat positive as I read it, but it's not going to be the driver it's been for the last three years, but that operating margin is going to be also helped by the work that we're going to do in the SG&A.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes. Every year, is different as you know, Bob, and we set out with a plan on January 1, and by January 2 it changes depending on what's happening in the market. And the one thing that will be true to Sean's point is our focus on this operating margin improvement. And so, the efforts that we'll be taking will get us there. We'll figure out a way to do that. It may, as Sean mentioned, not be the margins in the past, it may be greater leverage on the SG&A while driving sales. But our commitment is the improvement in operating margins going forward.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks for the help.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Sean, you've been a great CFO, but I still don't think your stock would take it this hard that you're going to be phasing back.","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes. I know what you mean.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Wishes going forward. You're going to open up about 40 stores in the fourth quarter here, which I think you've done before, you're usually backend loaded, but could you talk a little bit about the labor market for staffing 40 stores in a quarter and lease rates and things like that? I'd assume store openings are costing you more now than they probably ever have?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I don't know if they are costing us more than we ever had, and in our ability to recruit on campus has been terrific. We hire as you know, John, having travelled with us, between 1,200 and 1,400 management trainees a year. The performance of our company and the brand has allowed us to recruit the highest caliber trainees and you know, I'd say that that just continues, the more time I spend with our trainee class, the more I'm impressed with our ability to recruit such high caliber people.","So, we've got confidence there. We've been able to negotiate good rents and leases with our track record. And we're becoming more and more choice in these markets, because of our ability to ensure the financial strength of the company, and what we bring to the market. So, we're actually in a very good place right now and our focus continues to be on accelerating the performance of those new stores.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then secondarily, do you think the down DIY volume has anything to do with the channel positioning in advance of the Valspar closing?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","No, I don't think so. I think that we'll see what happens in the market on DIY specifically, but I don't think that it has an impact on it at all.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Oli Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC","Yes. Good morning, guys.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Good morning, Oli.","Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC","Regarding the comps throughout the quarter, did we see a very similar progression throughout the quarter that we saw through the year or so, beginning if the quarter was stronger and then tailing off?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I don't understand.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","No, I think we were pretty consistent on the cadence of sales throughout the quarter.","Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Got it. And then, just you mentioned that on the total sales, there was a 2.3% help on the revenue reclassification. Was there a similar impact on the comps in PSG?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","No, the comps in PSG were not impacted by the change in revenue reclass.","Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. And then lastly, just the reduction in the full year guidance, you left the sales guidance up low single digits, basically unchanged. So is that more of a function of gross margins or SG&A?","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I think, it comes back to I think the \u2013 it probably had more to do with the sales volumes in the third quarter than anything else.","Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Oli.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Couple of questions, first of all just wanted to follow up on the Paint Store comp, so you had 2.1% same-store growth and you had 2.3% from the reclassification of revenue, which still leaves about 2.5% or 2.3% sort of unaccounted for. Is that the price mix benefit or how should I think about classifying that especially since you've talked about a little bit of an FX headwind?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","You also have to factor in the new stores in that delta and then the rest of the price mix.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Price mix, okay. Fair enough. If you look at \u2013 you mentioned a couple of times that higher SG&A expense in the Stores Group in Latin America grew. Was that around just store openings or was \u2013 I mean or promotional activity or are you staffing external sales people more, can you talk about sort of what's driving the higher SG&A and why we should not look for that to continue into 2017?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","The majority of the SG&A increase was related to the new store and reps. I think the teams are doing a nice job of controlling the other SG&A around the fringes, based on the sequential slowdown in sales.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. But I mean your store growth this year is not that different from what it was last year and yet you called out SG&A expense. So, that's why I'm asking I guess.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","We also had, if you recall in the second quarter, we talked about the investments we were making in the Consumer Group and some of those have continued through. So, between the new stores and the continued investments in Consumer Group, that's what's driving the increase in SG&A.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. All right. And then just a quick question on tax rate, you talked about it being in the low 30%s for 2016. If you kind of look at Sherwin in isolation, and forget about the Valspar piece that's being added and what that can do to your tax rate, if you just look at Sherwin, is kind of the low 30%s tax rate is what we should be thinking about or the changes in taxes that you made, that were excluding from this year's earnings, how should we think about tax rate going into 2017 and Sherwin-Williams as a standalone entity without thinking about Valspar yet?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes, I think the core tax rate's excluding that, accounting adjustment, it will be in the low 30%s. If you look at our year-to-date effective tax rate, it's 31.7% versus 31.6% last year.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So basically, just continuation of the tax rate that we've seen?","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. All right, thank you very much.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Dmitry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question?","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Yes, good morning. I recognize Europe is not an enormous region for you, but to the extent that you are exposed there, I was wondering if you could comment on trends that you're seeing by product line and also on an individual country basis if you're seeing anything material there. It sounds like it hit Consumer a bit. And I'm wondering you know if you think that it's macro or broad based in nature or more idiosyncratic. Thanks.","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I think when you look at the business we have in Europe, I think we're not broad based at all. I think that we don't have any architectural business in Europe. So, we're not probably a good barometer of what's happening there. On the industrial side, we're probably heavy in industrial wood, but that's in the Global Finishes Group and that's actually been strong \u2013 stable I'd say, I'll use the word stable.","So, I think to try to get some type of barometer of Europe, we're not a very good indicator event.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Clear enough. And then second question if I may, possibly for Bob, I think you mentioned your commercial business was up. I was wondering if you could speak to non-res more broadly on your third quarter experience and your term outlook. Thanks.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes, Kevin. As a reminder, there is a pretty long lag between a non-residential start on average and when that project is painted. So, we are benefiting from fairly strong start activity 18 months ago to two years ago. And as a result, the commercial business is holding up quite well. It's not as strong as the residential segments. John indicated the residential businesses are up in the high single digits. It's not that strong, but it's really solid year-over-year growth. The dark lining around that silver cloud is that starts this year are actually down year-over-year. So, we're seeing some weakness in new projects started that if that persist, was going to impact our commercial business a couple of years out.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Okay.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","But for the time being, it's good.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Latin America. It was nice to see it get back above breakeven, and you've added about 25 stores this year. So can you talk a little bit about the strategy going forward, and what the outlook might be, should we expect it to remain above breakeven or could some of those investments start to weigh on the performance on the bottom line?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes. So, our approach in Latin America is really market specific, not even country specific. We understand that there are locations in the market throughout the Latin American region where the direct store model might be best, and there might be others that are best utilized through home centers or through dealers and our team down there is working very hard to upgrade our position in the marketplace, and by doing what we believe to be the heavy lifting now while the market is maybe choppy, might be an understatement, but while taking those steps now that we'll be better able to participate at a greater rate once the market does improve.","We do feel as though that it's hit a trough. It's too early to tell if it's improvement in the market is sustainable there, the choppiness in sales and profit likely to continue over the next few quarters, but we really do believe that the steps that we're taking right now are going to better position us by allowing for a better employee base that we have down there, better product line, more consistent products, and a much more efficient path to the customer than what we've had in the past. So, our expectations of what we're doing down there are clearly to outperform the market as we move forward.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","And I would add that going forward of course, you'd expect them to be closer to breakeven.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And you've also talked about some of the SG&A expense control. I was wondering if you could talk at all about your marketing and advertising expenses, and how those have trended during the year. At this point, are we running meaningfully above or below what we might think of as normal advertising expenses?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","No. I don't think we're meaningfully above or below. I think we're right around the same paces we've been in the past. We're trying to be as smart and efficient with what we're doing with media. But I wouldn't say that we've jumped or cut to anything in a meaningful way.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Hey, good morning.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Hey, Scott.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Quick question, I mean, your feedback that you're relaying from the field despite slower sales growth than you expected, is pretty positive on this call. But, I think in your prepared remarks, John, you noted that you're not sure if the housing cycle might be slowing or we might be in the later innings. So, being a good bridge is there's two comments, because it sounds a lot more bullish on the Q&A than what you may have said on the prepared remarks?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Well, my point was that we certainly saw a slowdown in the third quarter, Scott. And our feeling continues to be that the fundamentals still support the market in a very positive way. And, I know, you've heard Bob talk about those in a number of occasions. But, if you just look at household formations, new home sales, single family start permits, re-sales, the underserved entry into the new residential by builders, the fundamentals continue to be there. And, we expect that the contractor is going to be the benefactor of many of these opportunities and our position with that contractor is something that we're continuing to improve them.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","And, by the way, Scott, maybe it wasn't worded as well as it could have been, but John's opening remarks basically said, if it's a slowdown in the housing cycle contrary to all \u2013 with all the data would suggest. So, he was kind of qualifying it by saying, we're not seeing it in the data; but if it is, we're still going to invest in the thing that drive our growth.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Okay. I appreciate this, clarifying that. And just to kind of reiterate, is this I guess more uncertainty to the cadence of how the business is growing, have any impact on to how you are thinking about incremental investment back into the business and\/or on the synergy guidance for Valspar?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I believe that our investments will continue as you've seen. This is a year that's going to have record sales, record profit, record operating margin. We're going to continue to invest in those drivers that we believe will allow us to drive that operating margin further and that's going to be in new stores, new reps, new products and we believe that the contractors positioned as I said, very well in the market and our positions, we're going to be working very hard to improve that. And we've got confidence in that model and we've got confidence in our ability to execute it.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I just have a couple of quick ones. In terms of your sales growth for the fourth quarter for the year not really changing out that much, is that just more of a function \u2013 is that more of a function of the reclassification, so reclassification in the fourth quarter is going to be 2% impact, I guess sales would be flat to down excluding that?","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","No, I think that just low-single digit is on the core, it's just movement within the core \u2013 within that range.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, in terms of Valspar, is there any sort of change here, expectations that's going to close in the first quarter or expectation if one will here, it's something about a ruling?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","No, at this time we still believe this is going to be in the first quarter. We're down to just a few countries and we're feeling positive about the momentum that we have.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then last, does the currency in Latin America, does that turn into a tailwind starting in the fourth quarter?","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","No. I think it'll still be a headwind, I guess on somewhat to what we saw in the third quarter.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Ivan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Two questions for you. First of all, Bob or Sean or Allen, if you could review what we should be thinking about in terms of price, understand that increase becomes effective December 1, which I think is a little different language than you had in the past. Curious, what we should be assuming in terms of the time to implement and the amount of that, that should be expected to be realized?","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. I think that we've in the past have said that we've been 75% effective when you take a look at the increase. So, 4.5% to 5%, you're talking, use it 4.5 times, 75%, you're talking just over 3%. I think that we've constantly said that we're working to trying to get that quicker. I think you'll see some effect in December, but it will be muted. And I think that the first quarter, you'll see hopefully somewhere in that 50% effectiveness, and then, from then on I think you'll see it at 75%.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, secondly, we'd just love a little perspective, I think the statement was made that the store comp would be 5% x-Protective & Marine, and I'm curious within that or if you want to speak to the expectation of the architectural business, how that compares to the prior couple of quarters and what the expectation should be of that moving forward?","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. I think that the architectural and if you look at the quarters there's no doubt the first quarter was the strongest quarter. Architecturally, second was the second strongest and then the third. But I do believe, when you take a look at it, some of these, the third quarter was probably way down because of that DIY component that we talked about. So I think again, I think the John's comments about the strength of the market of why we could continue to invest and feel good about the \u2013 what kind of results we can produce in this Paint Stores Group are still driven by those spots on the architectural side.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Excluding DIY, are you capable of looking through the numbers or sharing with us excluding DIY, it sounds like the resi-repaint was up high single-digits versus perhaps low double-digits. What's other than DIY, it seems like the other pieces of architectural slowed a bit in 3Q relative to its 2Q growth, is that accurate?","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yes.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","And any thoughts on the driver to that?","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I will tell you this is, yeah, I think that labor you know \u2013 we're seeing things such as labor constrain some of these results that we're having in some of these quarters.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, Eric, it's not uncommon at all to hear contractors talk about their ability to do more work, if they had more qualified labor.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Eric.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks and a lot of questions have been asked. I appreciate you let me sneak one in here. So, I was just wondering from your perspective, obviously we have this dichotomy between the pro market, the contractor market and do-it-yourself. As you guys think back over the years the company, I mean you've ever seen this kind of divergence in the two, and in your opinion, what do you think's causing it, I mean it seems like consumer for some reason is a little weaker, I mean we're seeing that across a lot of different sectors and I'm just trying to understand, from your perspective, what you think is kind of going on. Have you ever seen this before, so anything you can shed, any light...","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah, Scott. This is Bob. We've talked for a long time about this long-term secular trend away from DIY toward the contractor. And we saw that kind of step back in the direction of DIY during the 2008, 2009 cycle. And since that time, we think that there has been a pretty strong migration back toward the pro. What we've observed in past cycles is that when we see a period of rapid home value appreciation, in many cases, it will accelerate the move back to the pro.","People are more incline to hire a professional when they're feeling more positive about the equities that they have in their home. So, the last three years, pretty rapid home value appreciation that we've seen may have accelerated this migration away from DIY and toward the pro. That's the best we've got; there is no empirical data as to why that's happening.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Could I do a follow-up quick, Bob, is that all right?","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. You bet.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. So, there's obviously been a lot of thoughts regarding millennials, younger households are probably more do-it-yourself versus do-it-for-me. Still want a buzz that millennials are finally kicking it into gear, but what you're saying to me maybe argues against that, I wonder if you have any thoughts on that piece as well? And then, thanks.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Well, we certainly agree that millennials will be a stronger driver in the housing market going forward. I mean there's forecast of between 13.5 million and 17 million new first-time home buyers, coming into the market in the next five years, which is really exciting to us, and all due respect for the younger generations, we disagree with the notion that millennials are strong DIY'ers. They have not shown to be at nearly the levels that their parents were. Baby boomers were far more DIY involved than their offspring, and you know, it certainly has a lot to do with schedules nowadays being very tight and lack of free time. But, we don't necessarily see the millennials coming into the home buying market as driving DIY the way the baby boomers did a generation ago.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","That's perfect. It of course argues to your business model too, so that's good news for the long-term. Anyway, thanks, guys. Really appreciate it.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You noted that keeping strong control on your SG&A cost just going to help your operating income line going forward, and of course that was represented in most of the segments. But you also did note some of the headwind in the Paint Stores Group. So, I'm curious, where will the incremental discipline come on the SG&A; is it going to be in the Paint Stores Group? And if so, how that affects your investment there? And if it's not in the Paint Stores Group, where would it be, because it seems you're pretty disciplined across the board?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Yeah. So, it's going to be across the board. And I think as you look at our opportunities going forward, the ability to leverage SG&A in every organization exist, I mentioned earlier about the Global Finishes Group taking a look at a number of the areas in the back office to become more efficient. We have those opportunities throughout the organization. What we're committed to though are those areas that are customer-facing and continuing to invest in this model. We just talked with the previous questioner about the long-term model and why it fits and why we believe in it.","So, you're going to continue to see us invest in new stores, territories, new products, the things that allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competition and you should expect us to continue to be animals on expenses. We had a discussion last week about our budgeting process and I mentioned Al coming on board and same discipline that we've had with Sean in the past. We're going into our operating plan process, we're starting at ground zero and we're ripping every expense out that we can that doesn't affect sales.","And so, we want to be that disciplined about what it is we're doing. We don't want to point to past success and justify future expense. We want to be invested in those things that are going to drive our business and we're committed to doing that in the models that will drive the operating margin that we've talked about.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Fair enough. And just as a follow-up. You note the weakness in oil and gas on the Protective & Marine, but there are a certain number of chemical projects coming out in the Gulf Coast. So, is it just that the size of oil and gas is so heighted, offset whatever is going on in chemical in that part of your business or do you just not have the type of mix that you want or exposure to the chemical industry for your Protective business?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Well, it's a little bit of both, we've had success in oil and gas in areas that are not investing right now and we're still growing market share in some of those areas. Even with the decline, we're still fighting and growing we believe share in a very challenging market, but to your point and it's the point that I try to make earlier, there are still areas for us \u2013 there are opportunities in the space, you mentioned the chemical areas where there are our assets coming online. We're fighting for everyone of those projects.","We know that the infrastructure is an area that eventually is going to have to be an area of focus for our country, and countries around the world, and we're furthering our penetration in those areas. So what I don't want to give is the impression that we're just sitting here waiting for the oil and gas market to fix itself, we're up there fighting in existing markets, in adjacent markets, and in new markets, and we believe that there is considerable amount of opportunity for us there, and we're determined to capture.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thanks for your help.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thank you, Nils.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research)","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking the call. The antitrust regulatory environment you have been doing deals for a while now, have you noticed the change this year as you've gone through the Valspar deal?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","No. I think they are doing their job, they are asking questions that are appropriate, and we're trying to be as responsive as we can. I think going into this, we knew the deal and the facts and feel confident that the facts will carry the day, but we've got a government agency that is empowered to look at these things, and challenge, and they're doing just that, and we're trying to be as responsive as we can.","Chris Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research)","All right. And then a quick question, inventory was up, are you carrying more volume of inventory due to the slowdown here, and on the back of that, you typically won promotions in through October at your Paint Stores?","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I'll address the inventory and our working capital was up slightly in the \u2013 through September. The way we look at it as a reminder, we target a 10% of sales, our working capital last year came in at 8.6%, we expect this year to come in around 10%. So, I don't believe we're carrying more inventory than we should be.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","And we do occasionally run promotion in October.","Chris Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research)","All right. Thank you, guys.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Wang with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was pretty late in the call. So, one on same-store sales in resi-repaint for professional. So, just in the home sales, it looks like they were basically flat or down year-on-year compared to the third quarter of 2015, but you guys saw a high-single digits in the professional segment there. Do you think that \u2013 I guess, would you attribute this to as a stronger business model? I know that we obviously saw weakness in DIY, but I'm trying to get a sense of why the professional segment was so strong?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Well, we've had a team that's been focused on that segment for many years, and it goes back to the comment that I made earlier about our commitment to providing the products, then services, locations, the people that will help us differentiate us from our competition. And we're blessed with good competition out there. So, we're not satisfied, we're not complacent. We're not sitting here feeling as though we've got it all figured out, we're trying to get better every day.","And with our direct model, which is unique and the ability to really partner with our customers in understanding what their needs are and sometimes satisfying needs that they don't even know exist, has allowed us we believe to grow a little faster than the market. And we're committed to doing the things that can help differentiate us from our competition by allowing our customers to be more successful and what they're trying to do.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","And, David, while you're right that existing home turnover does drive residential retain activity, remodeling activity in total year-to-date is up pretty substantially, it's up more than \u2013 it's up almost 6% in spending year-on-year. So, in the absence of a lot of growth in existing home turnover, we've seen growth in remodeling activity.","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","And one last thing I would add is the point that Bob made earlier, which is the shift to more and more contractor base, I think \u2013 we have to acknowledge that there is a shift going on to the contractor and we happen to be positioned very well for that contractor, but I also believe that's helping us as well.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Fine, great. Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon, everyone and congratulations to both, Sean and Al.","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Hey.","Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Thank you. Thank you, Chuck.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","We've talked of the contractors, you've mentioned this labor shortage, John, and I think it's even of impact as how aggressive they want to be on bidding at this point, does that board well for projects going into next year once the paint season gets underway, we're coming into some tougher weather now seasonally. So, what are your thoughts on that?","John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","I think it does, Chuck. I think it's \u2013 and that's the point that I made, I know I keep beating the same drum, but it's what gives us confidence about the model in 2017 and our ability to continue to drive operating margins going forward. You're exactly right.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. And looking at the Consumer Group, and Sean or Al you might want to address this one, the margins were up on lower sales. Does some of that reflect what went on last year with the load into Lowe's and introductory promotional spending?","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","No, I think the spending has been pretty consistent in it. It's like we talked about in the second quarter, it was may be different programs, but with the \u2013 around the other hedges of SG&A that they did a nice job of controlling their costs and we talked about the mix in that business that helped, so I think that's what's driving the margin.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","All right. Thank you. Oh! You know, and obviously at the end of the call, I got cut off somehow for a bit. And I think, I joined just as you were explaining that reclassification, if now is a good time to just quickly explain that it would be great, otherwise I'll catch you offline?","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","Chuck, we use third-party contractors and they do a variety of things for our customers, these previously immaterial amounts (79:37) SG&A, we determine that the billings to the customers should've been grossed up in sales with the payments for the contractors included in cost of goods sold in it, for net immaterial impact on gross profit. It does reduce our gross margin, and it does decrease our operating margin. And what we've talked about is, we did it prospectively in the third quarter, so we only booked it for the third quarter, we'll do that in the fourth quarter that I'll have a similar small impact, and then in the first quarter and second quarters of 2017. So 2017 full-year won't have any impact.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.","You're welcome.","Robert J.

Bob?","Robert J. Wells","Thanks, Chris. Summarizing overall company performance for second quarter 2013 versus second quarter 2012. Consolidated net sales increased $140.9 million, or 5.5%, to $2.71 billion, due primarily to higher paint sales volumes in our Paint Stores Group. Acquisitions added 0.7% to net sales in the quarter, and unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased consolidated net sales by 3\/10 of 1% percent. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $83 million over second quarter last year, to $1.23 billion.","Gross margin increased 80 basis points, to 45.5% of sales from 44.7% in the second quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 3.3%, to $837.1 million.

Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $53.1 million, or 16.2%, to $380.9 million.","Our effective tax rate in the second quarter this year was 32.5%, compared to 30.5% in the second quarter of 2012. For full year 2013, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30% range, compared to last year's rate of 30.4%.","Consolidated net income increased $29.5 million, or 12.9%, to $257.3 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 9.5% compared to 8.9% in the second quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 13.4%, to $2.46 per share from $2.17 per share in 2012.","Looking at our results by operating segment. Paint Stores Group sales in the second quarter '13 increased 8% to $1.61 billion. Comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 7%. Regionally, in the second quarter, our Southeastern division led all divisions, followed by Southwestern division, Eastern division and Midwestern division.","Paint Stores Group segment profit for the quarter increased $66 million, or 24.7%, to $333 million from $267 million in the second quarter last year. Segment margin in the quarter increased to 20.7% from 17.9% last year.","Turning to our Consumer Group. Sales in the second quarter decreased 1%, to $393.7 million from $397.7 million last year.

Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 20.1% from 20.3% in the same period last year.","For our Global Finishes Group, second quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 3%, to $513.5 million. Acquisitions increased net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately 1.1%, while unfavorable currency translations had minimal impact on sales in the quarter compared to last year. Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased 13.4% in the quarter, to $54.5 million from $48 million last year. Acquisitions had no significant effect on segment profits in the quarter, while unfavorable currency translation rate changes reduced segment profit $2.4 million. As a percent to net sales, Global Finishes Group segment profit was 10.6% in the quarter, compared to 9.6% last year.","For our Latin America Coatings Group, second quarter net sales in U.S. dollars increased 6.3% to $199 million. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased net sales by 2.8% in the quarter. Stated in U.S. dollars, segment profit in the second quarter decreased to $900,000 from $9.3 million in the same period last year, due primarily to an $11.8 million charge to cost of goods related to an import duly assessment by the Brazilian government for the years 2006 through 2008. This charge was partially offset by selling price increases and higher paint sales volumes.","Currency translation rate changes had minimal impact on segment profits in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 4\/10 of 1% in the quarter, compared to 5% in the second quarter 2012.","Turning briefly to our balance sheet. Our total debt on June 30, 2013, was $1.68 billion, including short-term borrowings of $50.7 million. Total debt on June 30 last year was $1.24 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $741.1 million, compared to $46.6 million at the end of second quarter 2012. Through the first 6 months of 2013, we spent $72.1 million on capital expenditures. Depreciation expense was $78.3 million and amortization expense was $14.1 million.","For full year 2013, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $130 million to $150 million, depreciation will be about $150 million, and amortization will be approximately $30 million.","I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. Trial began on Monday, July 15, in the Santa Clara County case involving public nuisance claims brought by 10 cities and counties in California against 5 defendant companies. The judge presiding over the case has limited oral arguments by each side to 40 hours, including live testimony and cross-examination, which should be concluded before Labor Day.","At the conclusion of the trial, the verdict will be determined by the presiding judge. There is no jury. At this point, we have no indication or sense of timing on a decision.","That concludes our review of the results for second quarter 2013. So I'll turn the call back over to Chris, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for third quarter and full year. Chris?","Christopher M. Connor","Thanks, Bob. We often say that our visibility with respect to end market conditions and input cost trends improved significantly in the second quarter, and this year was no exception. This improving visibility over the past few months has revealed a mixed bag of stable to declining raw material costs, continued strength in the domestic residential market, stagnant nonresidential and industrial activity, all against a backdrop of continued global economic malaise.","We've felt the effects, both positive and negative, of these disparate market conditions across different geographies and customer segments. I would say, however, that I'm generally pleased with our progress in most aspects of the business, although the second quarter had its normal share of ups and downs.","On the positive side, our Paint Stores Group continues to perform well. Comp store sales growth at 7% will likely outpace the U.S. architectural paint market in the second quarter, although we continue to see demand disparity across certain customer segments. Residential market demand in both new build and repaint remains very strong in -- even in the month of June. Most of the nonresidential markets, while positive, continue to lag the strength of residential. Protective and marine, for example, a strong category throughout 2012, has softened thus far in 2013.","Paint Stores segment margin for the quarter improved 280 basis points over the second quarter last year and eclipsed 20% operating margin percent to sales for the first time on record. This margin improvement was evenly divided between gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.","Global Finishes Group also made solid progress in the quarter despite the challenging conditions in most geographies outside of North America. Revenue growth in the quarter was aided by an acquisition completed in the fourth quarter last year, but the earnings improvement in the quarter came entirely from the core business. Flow-through on organic revenue growth in the quarter was nearly 65%, with notable improvement in both gross margin and SG&A. Although we're not satisfied with the current pace of revenue growth in this segment, as market conditions improve at home and abroad, Global Finishes Group margins should continue to expand.","On a less positive note, Consumer segment continues to feel the effect of loss paint businesses at several retail customers, although they've worked hard to mitigate the impact for the lost volume on segment profits. Perhaps the greatest disappointment in our quarter was the $11.8 million charge to our Latin American Coatings Group. The charge is related to our handling of import duties on products brought into Brazil during the years 2006 through 2008. Although we believe our handling of import duties was consistent with a large number of multinationals doing business in Brazil, we elected to accept a voluntary amnesty program offered by the government to resolve this issue rather than encourage significant legal expenses to contest it in court. In 2009, we changed our import duty process. However, the years subsequent to 2008 remain open to audit.","On the raw material front, it's pretty apparent that the major chloride TiO2 producers were unsuccessful in implementing the price increases announced in the first quarter of 2013 to be effective early in the second quarter. Additional price increases were announced late in the second quarter, with nominal effective dates generally around July 1. The increased plant utilization rates, decreased inventory levels and optimism of a third quarter TiO2 demand were cited as reasons for the increases. However, in all geographic markets, TiO2 pricing held steady in July, and we do not believe that market dynamics will change sufficiently over the balance of the year to justify the implementation of these increases in 2013.","Although crude oil moved up during the second quarter, propylene, the key feedstock for monomers, latex, solvents and containers, remained relatively stable, and we expect that to continue as well for the balance of the year. With our assumption of stable TiO2 costs and the current pricing of propylene, we expect average year-over-year raw material cost for the paint and coatings industry to be down low-single digits in 2013.","In the first 6 months of 2013, we've generated $302 million in net operating cash, an increase of $100 million over the first half of 2012. Approximately half of the improvement in net operating cash was from the increase in net income in the quarter, the other half resulting from lower cash required to fund our working capital.","Working capital, as we measure it, which is receivables plus inventories minus payables, decreased as a percent of sales, to 12% from 12.6% in the second quarter last year. We continue to use the company's cash to purchase shares of our stock for treasury, increase our cash dividend and expand our controlled distribution platform.","During the quarter, we acquired 800,000 shares of the company's stock for treasury, bringing our total year-to-date repurchase activity to 1.3 million shares at an average cost of $178.86 per share, and a total investment of $232 million.","On June 30, we have remaining authorization to acquire 15.2 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, up from $0.39 per share last year. So far this year, our Paint Stores Group has added 22 net new stores, 13 of which were open in the second quarter. This brings our total store count from the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean to 3,542, compared to 3,470 1 year ago. As we commented in April, we are ramping up our new store opening activity, and our Paint Stores Group plans to add approximately 70 to 80 net new store locations during the year.","Looking ahead, we remain optimistic that U.S. architectural paint market demand, primarily in the residential segments, will remain strong as we go through the prime painting season. Based on this outlook, our expectation for third quarter 2013 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the range of 6% to 9%, compared to last year's third quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, compared to last year's record performance of $2.24 per share.","For the full year 2013, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2012 by mid-single-digit percentage, with annual sales at that level, we are reaffirming our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share, compared to $6.02 per share earned in 2012.","Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of questions just on the overall business fundamentals. The volumes for same-store sales kind of number for your Paint Stores was 7%? And I think when you adjust for, kind of Easter falling out of this quarter unlike last year, it looks like it's more like a 5% type number, which seems a little bit lighter than what we would expect given what's going on in the construction market. So I guess, can you walk us through maybe some of the puts and takes that might be driving those volumes maybe coming in a little bit lighter than expected?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, so I'll take a crack at that, John. First of all, I think the 2% impact for Easter might be a little strong for us. It's not that strong of an impact. And we have been commenting about the mix change we've been seeing this year. So our gallon numbers actually were terrific. And it's slightly higher than that sales number that we indicated. We're pretty confident that, that is a, an improvement over what the market ran for the particular quarter. So from our perspective, we see that as a pretty good quarter for the Stores group.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then just one quick question with the regard to the guidance. I mean, you're reaffirming the guidance at this point. Yet, and it sounds like the raw material environment's better than you were originally thinking. So are you starting to give some back, maybe on the pricing side, or are there other kind of puts and takes that we should be thinking about? Is it something around the timing of Comex potentially closing or, I guess, what's the change there?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think the guidance reaffirming has a couple of moving parts in it. You're correct, the raw material environment certainly is looking better. But we've also just taken an $0.08 hit relative to this Brazilian tax. So holding the guidance at that level, we think, indicates our confidence in the strength of the second half.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Chris, I was wondering if you can help out on the consumer side. You've referenced losing some business at a few retail customers. I guess we knew Walmart was a prominent one. Could you maybe give us a little color on the others? And then, if we were to take that issue aside, why wasn't there better growth in the consumer, given that, as you said, the residential markets were reasonably hot?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, fair question, Bob. Thanks for the call. We have commented repeatedly about Walmart, as well as, in earlier calls, confirming a Masco comment about the displacement of the Sherwin-Williams Dutch Boy program out of Home Depot, Mexico. As Masco Behr moved that program into that country for the first time. So those are the 2 impacts that we're seeing for the division. And that's had a significant impact. If we back those 2 things out, we're marginally positive there. We have commented for many, many quarters now that this segment has a little bit of a tough road ahead of us, given the strength of the stores organization in the same markets that they're competing with. And for the -- to your comment about rebounding home programs, we made the comment that we were disappointed in the quarter. So we expect this team to do better.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Last quarter, you commented on a big deviation in volumes between external and internal paint. I think a lot of that was weather related. Chris, can you just sort of update us on how that evolved during the second quarter?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, this is Sean Hennessy. The -- when you look at the volumes and that disparage between the exterior and interior that we had, really, because of the exterior first quarter 2012 that we had, very, very strong. As we saw a little more normal, but exterior's still, because of rain, different rain in certain segments. But usually, we don't talk about weather. But because of that, it wasn't all the way back to normal yet on that interior\/exterior mix.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, and then just one quick one on Comex, as best as you can answer it. Can you point us towards some other transactions in Mexico that were brought and ultimately went through closed, perhaps some concessions? Do you have a sense of that?","Christopher M. Connor","No, we don't have any comment regarding those transactions at this point in time.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Chris Nocella with RBC Capital Markets.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you just give us a sense of how long you think the appeals process could take with Comex? And I see some headlines suggesting accommodation to that market share of maybe 48% to 58%. So can you remind us of your market share in Mexico and maybe what level you think they'd be comfortable with?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, so I can't answer the deal process because it's somewhat perfunctory, Chris. After a verdict like this, the parties have 30 days to issue in a formal appeal. And then once the Chairman of the commission has accepted the appeal, they have 60 days, and those are working days, just to clarify that, to render an opinion on that. It would be inappropriate for us to make any comments relative to what levels of market share the commissions would be interested in seeing.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, does a Comex deal without Mexico make sense? Maybe supplement it with a large share repurchase?","Christopher M. Connor","I think there are reasons for people to think through that. Our public statements are that we're -- remain committed to completing the full transaction, including both the Canadian, United States and Mexican sides of the deal.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Nomura Securities.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Starting at the news on Comex, understand your desire to go to the mat to get the deal done, but 2 things in and around that and then a follow-up. One, are you able to kind of buy back stock aggressively or are you kind of in a holding pattern, as that relates, whether it's kind of a quiet period or other things like that? And then, second, how can you make sure that you avoid distraction inside the company, so that if you kind of go at this another couple of quarters or 6 months that it doesn't kind of affect your business in any unintended way? And then I have a follow-up.","Sean P. Hennessy","Sure. When you think a look at the stack, we are in a blackout. We're in a blackout for 3 days, until 3 days after we've announced, then. We think we'll continue with what we've been doing in the past, but as of today, we can't buy stock today.","Christopher M. Connor","In terms of avoiding distraction, Aram, we are the masters at avoiding distraction at Sherwin-Williams. We've had lead lawsuits and all the kinds of noise for -- to contend with. And here, again, we're blessed with really terrific leadership in our field operations. Our folks are out selling paint today and taking care of customers, just like every other day. So while the folks on the phone are spending a little time on this issue, rest assured, the rest of the 40,000 folks are doing what they're supposed to be doing today.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And just around the California legislation, could you just comment as to whether or not you've reserved differently? The 10-Q usually comments on kind of reserves for environmental, and how you're kind of treating that, and whether or not the prior cases that have been dismissed are fair precedence, or you think this one might be, I don't know, be more unique?","Sean P. Hennessy","No, we think that's fair precedence. You think about Rhode Island and a lot of others. Mississippi, Wisconsin, Ohio, New Jersey. We've never created a reserve for lead lawsuits.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Chris, I think you had made a comment in your prepared remarks that your comparable store growth is 7%. Paint Stores' likely outpace the market. So if you can give us a sense of where you think the market is running at the industry level for gallonage? And how much you might be exceeding that pace?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, we don't have good visibility into that, Kevin, until several quarters in arrear, when some of the various reporting groups get some data out for us. We have commented that we believe our industry grows at a, historically, in pace with GDP, 1% to 2%. As we rebound to a more normalized architectural coatings demand in our market, we've talked about that running at a little higher pace, let's say, 3%, 4%. We've seen growth for the industry, maybe in the range of 5% here over the last couple of years, as we're seeing some of these rebounding quarters. But, as I mentioned in the first call that John asked, don't forget that our gallon numbers were in excess of that 7% revenue number. So we'll have a better sense here in a little bit. But we're still pretty confident that the teams are doing great in the stores group in terms of taking gallon share.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then a second question, if I may, on the Latin America Coatings Group. I think you had a translation effect there on the top line, but your press release seems to indicate there was no impact on segment profit. I guess it was my understanding you hadn't been hedging and perhaps, you could help me kind of understand how the bottom line would've been insulated in the quarter, given the volatility in the local currency there?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, I think we did have debt. I think what we're trying to do, over the years, especially in the last couple of years, is to bring cash forward, allow the debt there to be a natural hedge. And when you look at, really, Brazil is where we were -- really had a major change in that quarter. So we were fairly hedged.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then final question, for Chris, if I may, it is in terms of potential scenarios for redeployment of capital, if indeed Comex ultimately does not go through. Care to offer any comments on what you're seeing in terms of the M&A pipeline? Are there other opportunities that you see out there in the private market that might be appealing alternatives?","Christopher M. Connor","Sure, Kevin. I think as deployment of capital goes forward here, regardless of the Comex transaction, frankly, you're going to see Sherwin continue to operate in its traditional fashion. We are not hoarders of cash. We'll put that to work. We're comfortable buying back stock, as we've indicated over the years. There are always M&A opportunities for us. We have a disciplined approach and a strategic list of targets that would be of interest to the company. Your comment about many of them being privately held family businesses dictates it's on a certain path in order to try to get those to market. And those conversations have been happening in this environment and will continue to happen. Nothing new to report at this time.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Question on the actual timing of the Comex response, I guess, from the Mexican government. It seems like it, given the amount of time that they have to respond, it wouldn't be until late in the fourth quarter. So is there any reason that they might -- you might be able to accelerate that, so you get a little bit better clarity sooner?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, Nils, our intent will be absolutely to accelerate. And we're approaching this with speed and urgency. It would be premature for me to comment, because I simply don't know how quickly we can get them to engage in what that outcome might be.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Understood. In terms of, then, in Latin America, it seems like the second quarter has been a bit of a dip in the last 2 years. Is there anything changing in terms of seasonality or product mix that's causing that from the operating profit perspective?","Sean P. Hennessy","We continue to do a lot of different things in Latin America. In fact, we just did a major IT project down there. And Oracle was now turned on in Argentina on the third of July. So we've been doing a lot of different things in the last couple of years. We'll keep moving on that project. We think that, that project's going to help us with working capital and reducing the working capital as a percent of sales. And I think you're right about the second quarter, because if you look at the year-to-date, last year, our ROS in that segment was 7.4% through the first 6 months and the first 2 quarters. This year, with the adjusted, if you add back the Brazilian import situation, we're at 8.2%. And we look at our forecast for the year, and, I'll just tell you, we think that we still see us improving and moving forward on ROS improvement for the year.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And just a final one, if I may. Does it -- when you look at some of what the competitors have put out there in terms of their growth rate in Latin America, it seems like you're doing a little bit better. Are there -- is there any share shifts going on? Or is it just not really comparable?","Christopher M. Connor","I think if there are share shifts, they're minimal at best at this point in time.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citigroup.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Chris, you didn't mention weather and the wet spring, which would have impacted at least your Exterior Paint business. Did you make up any of the losses in June as the weather improved?","Christopher M. Connor","Okay. I think on the call, PJ, we made the comment that we'd seen strength in the residential markets, and including, during the month of June, there was a lot of noise in the market relative to other impacts to the demand curve there. As Sean said in I think, in one of his answers, we're not ones for giving weather reports on these calls. We expect to have weather issues in various parts of the geography at all quarters, frankly. And so the health and robustness of the residential markets, both new and repaint, are really the core thing that we're looking at and providing confidence on. And we expect that over a cycle, weather will not be that big of an impact.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And, Chris, you talked about some pricing pressure in big commercial projects during the last call. Can you tell us if that is continuing? And if commercial is weak to get to 7% same-store growth, was residential up double digits?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, on both recounts. Commercial bidding activity, in an environment like this, where folks are going aggressively after gallons, has always been tough in an environment. With moderating raw materials, we expect to see it even more so, and that's been the case. And then on your analysis on the residential impact being double-digits is also accurate.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just quickly, have you seen any impact from paint geared towards contractors launched at Lowe's [ph] ?","Christopher M. Connor","No, we have not. I don't think that program's been out there long enough to get any indication of the impact it might have.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fisher with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to talk to the incremental margin in the Paint Store business jumped really strong this quarter, up over 50%, where it had kind of been 38% in the first quarter. Can you walk through the buckets of what improved so well in that business, as far as profitability relative to sales growth?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, I would tell you, #1, we're starting to see SG&A improvement. I know that in the first quarter, we had mentioned that in the first quarter 2012, that sales were so strong, we did not get all the SG&A service dollars into that first quarter that we should have had. And we had to go against that history in the first quarter of this year. And remember, at the end of the first quarter, we said, hang in there because we thought that we would be flat to down slightly year-to-date in SG&A, which we finally did. But as those gallons go through the stores, this is the piece where we really feel good about our flow-through. And I think that it was just gallons, gallons going through, but that's G&A leverage. And that's what -- that's really what created it.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. So that feels like a good, solid margin, that above 20% is a good baseline as you would look at it and others see seasonality with it, but there is nothing -- okay, terrific.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, we think that's in the first and the fourth quarter, and I...","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, fair enough. And then, when you look at your business and the Comex business in Mexico, not so much around the deal, but we've certainly got a lot of bad macro news flows about the housing market down there and financing for housing. How would you handicap the health of the coatings market going into that today versus if you think about when you would have announced the deal?","Christopher M. Connor","It's clearly softer, Duffy, specifically around the impacts that you've mentioned. The government has redirected some of their support for various housing programs. And that's had an impact on some of the large homebuilders in the region. So we have felt that in our business moderately, and I would suspect Comex has as well.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, and then just one last question on Comex, in particular. I remember, Chris, you talking about one of the really strong points of the Comex business was just the density that they had. And if one of the fixes, and, again, this is a little bit of a speculation, but if one of the fixes that the government would ask for is the divestiture of some of the points of sale, is that a linear line? Or is there something asymmetric there, where the business starts to lose some of its attractiveness pretty quickly if you had to divest some stuff?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, first of all, their business model is through an independent concessionario, 3,300 of these other Mexican businesses which operate these facilities. They're not owned by the Comex company themselves. so that in and of itself may not be the solution. And again, as we've commented earlier, all those types of potential outcomes are just purely speculative at this point in time, and we prefer to wait and work through the normal channels here.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","First, on the gross margin expansion. Could you help us with how much of it was due to manufacturing leverage, with the gallons coming through versus the price of raw material mix dynamic?","Sean P. Hennessy","I would say that the gallons coming through our plants, when you look at the -- I'll just go to the very -- the 45% versus the 43.8% on a year-to-date basis. Really, the majority of it was just the strong sales, the incremental sales. I would say the incremental gallons and incremental sales are really the -- they've created that gross margin, not selling price.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right, so and then, I guess, that ties into the next, okay. If gallons are up 8, current resi, stronger than commercial, how should we think about the 8 versus the 7 in terms of that price, it's basically just all mix? And is it mix within those different categories, or just mix between the 2?","Sean P. Hennessy","I would say mix within category, yes.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then, lastly, you guided to a 6% to 9% growth number for the third quarter. I guess, what's sort of taking that acceleration? Is there something, easier compares or do you see anything specific in terms of orders or customer dynamic to give you that confidence?","Sean P. Hennessy","No, I think if you look at it, we think we're fine. I think the third quarter's looking a little stronger. But I wouldn't say that our sales in the second quarter versus 6% to 9% is that dramatically different, right? I think we're going to be fine.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Chris, and I realized you can't say much on Comex, but, just to make sure I got the timing right. You said the -- you've already extended the merger agreement to the end of August. Would you expect to extend that again in the near term to give yourself more time, given the 30-day for a formal peer and 60-day review?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, it's premature to comment on that at this point in time, Greg. I'm sorry.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","In the Global Finishes segment, were there similarities or differences between Auto Refinish and other businesses, like Product Finishes? I would have thought you might be seeing some benefit from the Exalta situation, that the 2 businesses might have to converged within that segment?","Sean P. Hennessy","I think that when you look at the Automotive, we had Pulanna, which was an acquisition. So the Automotive piece was the strongest of the 3 pieces, with or without the acquisition.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And was there material spending in the quarter on the Comex deal in your SG&A?","Sean P. Hennessy","$0.01 to $0.02 a share.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","With some insight into where raw material costs are at this point, as you'd indicated, as you think about the map or the path on gross margin from here. I'm wondering if you can just give us some of your thoughts and strategy and thinking on where that goes?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, and I think when you look at the gross margins, for the first half of the year, we were at 45. I think that without the Brazilian situation that we spoke of, that 45.2%. And we've continually said we're in that 43% to 46% range. And I would expect that our gross margin will come in between that 45% and 46% range for the year.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","There's been some discussion in the past of the range potentially being better in this cycle. I'm wondering as you think of the structural issues going on with input cost and also where we are in terms of volume and leverage, how do you think about doing better than that 43% to 46% range over the next 12 to 18 months?","Sean P. Hennessy","I think that over this period, I think, as we've commented in the past, we've always believed that eventually, we'd be at 44% to 47%, potentially, 45% to 48%. I think that, right now, it'd be premature. One of the things that we are sort of waiting to see is, after the Comex closes, to really show the combined gross margin it would be an effect in the short run. And we think it changes our long-term goal. So I think if that -- when that occurs, I think we'd be in a lot better shape to give you some updated numbers.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","In terms of, related to this, secondly, in terms of the benefit from the input costs, looking at better revenue growth than the quite incremental margin in the back half of the year, should the profitability progress of the first half be sustained or improved in the back half? How should that look as we work through the second half?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, when you look at the first 6 months, I think that we're at 3 57 versus 3 13 at $0.44. The mid-point of our range is $1, and I'll tell you that we're going to have to have a higher flow-through in this improvement in the third and fourth quarter than we'd had in the first 2 quarters.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","And then, secondly, as it relates to the Comex.","I'm just curious what color you can give us on your interactions with the commission prior to last evening's decision from them? If you could just shed some light on the interactions, the questions they've asked and sort of given your response to the decision last night, relative to those interactions?","Christopher M. Connor","Sure, just briefly, Eric, on that point. We've been represented by outside counsel in Mexico City, who specializes in working with this commission. They have had appropriate meetings with the commissioners during the process. Several of our management team has been able to participate in those discussions to help clarify points, provide data, et cetera. And so I would characterize that as being open and appropriate conversations.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Was that a surprise last night, relative to the sort of candor and tone of those discussions?","Sean P. Hennessy","I'd be careful to not particularly use that word surprised. I think we'll just leave it at disappointment.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Chris, just to clarify or maybe expand a little bit on that, the last question. So can you talk at all, even high level, on some of the points of contention that the commission raised, things that you have to go back and look at or address just to understand what are the dynamics that the commission is focused on?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Dennis, as we commented, we got this report late last night. It was 144 pages in Spanish. We are going through that in great detail at this moment. I think it just would be premature to comment at this time, unfortunately.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Come on, Chris. You got to bone up on your Spanish. Okay, that's fair. On the business side, within same stores, can you just maybe comment a little bit more on what's driving the mix and whether that's a temporary dynamic within some of the categories or if that's the exterior\/interior dynamic and how that plays out as you kind of normalize out weather?","Christopher M. Connor","No, I think we've mentioned it before. I think residential's been tremendously stronger than commercial. And I think that new residential has been fairly strong. So when you look at those 2 pieces, that's really what's been driving it.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","You're seeing the gallon, the gallon mix on the residential price is lower than non-res? Or just new construction?","Sean P. Hennessy","New construction, in general, is usually a lower average selling price. As that continues to become a higher percentage of our sales, that drives gallons faster than sales.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then is there a...","Robert J. Wells","I'm sorry, this is Bob. There is also still a slight interior-to-exterior mix difference relative to last year. Although it's what Sean said, the new construction, plus an interior-to-exterior mix difference.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And is there a similar negative drag on the margin line?","Sean P. Hennessy","No, the operating margins are strong.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","All right. Well, I know that they're strong, Sean, but I'm just asking is there a drag on that or is it just the top line drag?","Robert J. Wells","No, we've talked for a long time, Dennis, about the consistency of the platform for products and assessments we're in. So we're fine in that regard.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, I just want to clarify that the new EPS or the new unchanged EPS guidance, does that include the $0.08 Brazilian duty expense?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Is that another way you would have been raising guidance if that -- if we hadn't run into that issue?","Christopher M. Connor","We've got a dime range, and it's only $0.08. So it's in there.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. Well, okay. And then, secondly, just again to clarify the comments you made about the Mexican housing market getting softer versus when the Comex deal was announced, can you just clarify the original arrangement had -- just, does it have a price adjustment if there is a material change in that market and the performance, because now we're talking with the range that you gave, about 1 year going by just before the potential closing?","Sean P. Hennessy","As we continue to do the due diligence and the market has changed, there's other things that have not changed, and some other things that have gotten stronger. We continue to look at the pro forma. We look at what our -- what we expect to get a return on our assets that we put into this and the internal rate of return. And we don't have an automatic adjustment for the market conditions. I think that, as we've gone through, I think we're still, if this closes any time soon, even with the, in our mind, short-term market changes in Mexico, we think this is going to create nice shareholder value.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then lastly, just 2 housekeeping questions. One, your administrative expense, excluding the change in interest expense, seems to be down in the first half of the year. Do you expect that to continue to be down in second half? Or should we think about that going back up? And...","Christopher M. Connor","Well, I think -- oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No, no, go ahead. I'm going to ask the second one afterwards.","Christopher M. Connor","I would say that we expect, even without the SG&A from the interest expense, the way you were referring to that question, we think that, that expense will be up slightly in the year. We just think there were some timing \u2013 and, again, we have some -- a couple IT projects that we're going to be working on in that -- in admin, also.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and then, lastly, if you could just give the gross profit change by segment, if you could just...","Sean P. Hennessy","Sure. I got it. Gross profit change by Store group, $83 million. Consumer Group was down $400,000. Global Finishes, $8.6 million improvement. And Latin America is down $9.2 million. And I just want to remind you, that $9.2 million is -- that's where the $11.8 million was expensed as the cost of goods sold.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with Keybanc Capital Markets.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Real quick. The residential recovery's been going on for a while now, and I understand nonresidential tends to lag, it's historically lagged. Is this lag lasting a little bit longer than you would have expected? Or is this sort of in line with expectations? And how would you sort of gauge your outlook for nonresidential, based off of, I guess, historic trends?","Robert J. Wells","Ivan, this is Bob. I think what we're seeing is that there are certain categories of nonresidential that has been real slow to start. And that's not unexpected. Retail was severely overbuilt during the last run-up. We're seeing solid construction activity in multi-family housing. We're seeing a pickup in office. Some of the institutional categories, specifically schools and government buildings, have been slow to start. So it's choppy across subcategories in the nonresidential market. But I think most of the nonresidential market is starting to pick up as expected. As a reminder, we do expect positive overall nonresidential volume this year in terms of square footage put in place.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, for the Mexican market, if you could you remind me, what is the breakdown between, I guess, the total volumes in housing, new construction and repaint? And how much do the builders -- do they dominate, the large builders, dominate the new construction in Mexico? How does that market sort of -- I mean, how do gallons break out, I guess...","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, it would be very similar to the United States architectural business model that we've commented on for a long period of time. The vast majority of coatings in Mexico are to maintain and decorate existing structures. New construction totally would be in that 25% range, plus or minus a little bit. There are large Mexican homebuilders, but there are hundreds if not thousands of other independent builders as well, too. So you can pretty much apply the same kind of modeling to the U.S. market that we've commented on and share with you a long period of time to Mexico.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then my last question. On the Brazilian market, there's been a lot of uncertainty. Does that continue to -- what are you seeing in terms of your business on there? It looks like your results remain fairly strong.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think there has been some noise surrounding Brazil's overall economic environment. We've had some segments that have been a little bit harder hit. Don't forget that one of the things that Brazil has in its future is hosting this World Cup and the Olympics. And the construction is build out of the required stadiums, airport expansion and housing, all areas where it would impact our business. So that's a little bit behind schedule. But some of our strength is relative to the work we've seen happening in that space so far.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Chris, a question on your ability to outsustain or outperform industry growth. You're growing 7%, industry's 3% to 4%. How much of that, do you think, is due to your stronger position in new home construction because of your relationships with the top homebuilders? And how much is -- would be repaint, where you're just seeing a swing back to contractors?","Christopher M. Connor","Clearly, Don, as this rebound is occurring, we've commented about the emerging importance of the professional painting contractor. They have they've troughed a little bit during the downturn. And we expect that we're on our way back to about a 60-40 mix, where 60% of all the coatings will be purchased by professional painting contractors. Clearly, the new residential construction market, in terms of -- and all new construction. Bob just commented briefly on multifamily also being a strong, new segment as well, so we're getting a lift from that, and we'd expect that to continue.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And on the last call, part of your confidence in the outlook for the year was just the backlog that your contactor customer base had. How is that looking? Are they still relatively confident in the business outlook? And the other comment you made is that weather doesn't create or destroy demand for paint. It just defers it or accelerates it. So, this adverse weather that we saw in the second quarter, does that just push out demand into the third quarter or is lost for the year as a whole?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I would say you're accurate with all of your questions there. We would expect that the contractors book of business looks robust. Sean just commented on the third quarter sales guidance being a little bit stronger even in our second quarter. As we meet with these folks on a daily basis through our stores, they're continuing to give us indications. They've got a good book of business. And to your point about weather just moving demand back, none of these folks are commenting about the impact of weather. They're continuing to be on projects and expect that they're going to have a pretty solid second half as well.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","It sounds like from your comments, that your commentary on raw material expectations seems to be a little bit better than it was earlier in the year. I think there was some concern about second half of the year seeing some inflation in the petrochemical side of raw materials, at least. Now you're looking at it being flat and TiO2, obviously, is flat and down year-over-year. Your guidance was basically flat versus your previous expectations. So is raw material improvement, if it is there, just not significant enough? Or was this basically the $0.08 penalty from Brazil that prevented you from raising guidance on a little bit more robust outlook for cost? Or is there some other, sort of cautionary things that you're seeing in the market in the back end of the year that you would rather keep the powder dry as far as your expectations are concerned?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, on the raw material factor, Dmitry, there's obviously, there's a lot of moving parts. We believe that the TiO2 producers were going to push pricing hard, beginning in the second quarter, and they have. We weren't sure whether market conditions would be such that they'd actually realize some of the pricing that they were pushing. Our outlook, our point of view now is that market conditions will not accommodate a price increase or any effective pricing in TiO2. We weren't sure whether propylene would remain stable. It appears to be holding pretty steady, despite the run-up in crude oil. So I would say that, to Chris' opening comments, there's a lot more clarity now than there was 3 months ago. I wouldn't characterize, on the total raw material basket outlook for the industry, as far better today than it was 3 months ago. It's maybe, marginally better.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then we're in our third year of negative volume comps on the consumer line or in consumer division. Obviously, in 2011, it was -- the majority of that was Walmart loss and then, I guess, a little bit of that spilled over into 2012. And now we have the Mexican Home Depot issues with Masco replacing Dutch Boy. When are we going to -- or when do you think you're going to anniversary that, and we actually get to see sort of the clean performance of the consumer group and hopefully, positive numbers [ph]?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, the other thing, just to make sure that -- you did a nice job of presenting the history, but you have to remember that when we did do the Walmart deal, when that Walmart deal was the major hit and last, at the end of the third quarter last year, we had another step down. And that's what we're anniversary-ing. So on the last call, again, Masco put it out there. In the fourth quarter of last year, and they -- we had that Mexican Dutch Boy will convert to Behr. So when you take with the last quarter, we said that, really, we were going to see negative through the third quarter. Then after the third quarter, we'd expect that we'd start to see some improvement there. So I think we answered it that way after the first quarter, and we feel pretty good about that answer. I wouldn't change it.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, so fourth quarter, we should start seeing more apples-to-apples type of comparisons anniversary-ing all the headwinds as far as business losses?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan Chase.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In terms of the-- are you -- do you continue to be optimistic about the Comex transaction? Because, at worst, you could divest your own Mexican business and own their much, much larger Mexican business? And did you offer them -- did you offer the commission any remedies so far, or remedies have not been discussed yet?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, Jeff, we'll always squeeze you in, first of all, so thanks for being on the call. And secondarily, those are all appropriate thoughts and ideas and questions for you to ask. And equally as appropriate, I cannot comment on any of that at this point in time.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and then lastly, sequentially, did your prices change either positively or negatively in your stores and in your consumer business?","Sean P. Hennessy","No, not at all. I think when you look at the second quarter versus the first quarter, it's been over 12 months since we've had the last price increase. And the selling prices are not dramatically different.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Are you allowed to say whether you're optimistic or pessimistic about the closing of the Comex transaction?","Christopher M. Connor","Jeff, we're optimistic by nature here, and I think the comments we gave early on about the multiple paths we have to continue pushing forward here, we're hopeful that we'll get this done.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Aram Rubinson with Nomura Securities.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","While I'm at it, can you talk about both the promotional environment and maybe the cadence of comps by range? Because I think by region, you mentioned there was a big range, and I was just curious to how wide a range there was by region?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, so the promotional activity, Aram, has been very consistent in our industry pretty, much for decades on end now. This is the time of year when you'll see discounting by all the major retailers, including Sherwin-Williams, to drive traffic into stores around the big peak holiday seasons, and, certainly, July 4 qualifies as one of those. Bob did comment briefly about our Southeastern division leading the pack, Southwestern division second, then Eastern and Midwestern. All of them solidly in the mid-single digits and above range. The range was not very wide.","Operator","Our next question is a question coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates.","Richard O'Reilly","Can you remind me or us, we had the volumes in the -- are the volumes for the Paint Stores made in the Consumer Group, or is it the other way around?","Sean P. Hennessy","No, the product that is sold through Stores Group is produced in the Consumer Group. So the Consumer Group is making product for sales of the Consumer Group, as well as the Paint Stores Group. So they also handle the logistics and warehousing.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay. So the consumer margin is down only a couple of percentage point -- basis points, even though the sales are down because the Paint Stores Group volumes were up so well. Is that how I should be thinking about it?","Christopher M. Connor","They definitely get a positive impact, yes, from having the Paint Stores Group improving volume.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay. And then a second question, if I can. Following up on the raw materials, I think you had said you saw your -- the overall basket now down low single digits. And we know about pigments. And propylene, at least, is down from the first quarter levels. What else in that basket is up or down noticeably? I mean, is packaging, or is distribution in there? What else can you comment on?","Sean P. Hennessy","Richard, distribution is not in there. But we tend to comment on propylene and TiO2, because TiO2 represents the vast majority of the pigment category. And propylene affects about -- the cost of about 60% of the raw material basket by cost. So we find propylene to be a good proxy for most of the rest of the basket outside of pigments. There is some movement in various specific solvents that we don't tend to delve into. But for the most part, packaging, latex and resins, and most of the base load solvents are holding pretty steady.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of JD Punjabi with Very.","Unknown Analyst","Just -- can you give us a little bit more color on what's going on in the Marine and Protective market? Why is it we can actually -- when you expect things to turn around there? And also, if you can provide a little bit more color on some of the other industrial coating markets, that will be great.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. So the Marine market, Protective and Marine markets, for us, predominantly, as we've commented through our Global Group businesses, is a North American business. So we have a terrific share position in the United States, on a variety of different end segments here. I think Bob also commented about just some of the softness that we're seeing in the nonresidential sector of the economy, and, frankly, that's almost totally where the Protective and Marine business resides. Our segments would include there Bridge and Highway, petrochemical, wastewater treatment, energy, food and beverage. The military's an important component of that. Or, better said, the government is an important component of that. So sequesters have a little bit of an impact here as well. The good news for this business for us has always been that this is one of these types of painting projects that you can't defer maintenance for long. And so we think there's been just a slowing of it, a little bit, over this last quarter. And discussing the projects that we see on the books and with our contractors who work in this space, they're confident that the second half of the year will be better for them, and we'd expect to report that going forward.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any concluding comments.","Robert J. Wells","Thanks, Jesse. As always, I will be available for the balance of the day, tomorrow and throughout the coming week to answer your follow-up questions. I appreciate your patience if you're in the queue now. And, again, thanks for joining us today and thank you for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. ","I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.","Bob Wells","Thanks Jesse. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information, including a slide deck describing our new reportable segment on our website sherwin.com, under Investor Relations July 20 press release.","I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the second quarter 2017 compared to second quarter 2016 then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased 16% or $516.3 million to $3.74 billion due primarily to the Valspar sales in June and higher paint sales volume in the Americas Group and Performance Coatings Group. The change in revenue classification increased consolidated sales 2.2% in the quarter.","Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $101.2 million or 6.2% to $1.74 billion in the quarter. Our consolidated gross margin decreased 430 basis points in the quarter to 46.5% of sales from 50.8% in the second quarter last year.","Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 9.3% or $97 million over the second quarter last year to $1.15 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased 190 basis points to 30.7% in the second quarter this year from 32.6% last year.","Amortization increased to $28.9 million from $5.6 million last year due entirely to the increase in intangible assets related to the Valspar acquisition. Interest expense increased $15.8 million compared to second quarter last year to $56.7 million. The vast majority of this increase was acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $30.2 million or 5.6% to $509 million.","Our effective tax rate in the second quarter on income from continuing operations was 29.1%. For the full year 2017, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the high 20% range. Consolidated net income decreased $59 million or 15.6% to $319.1 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 8.5% compared to 11.7% in the second quarter last year.","Diluted net income per common share for the quarter decreased 15.8% to $3.36 per share from $3.99 per share in 2016. The $3.36 includes a $0.44 charge related to the Valspar industrial wood finishes divestiture and a $0.92 dilution from acquisition-related expenses, including a step-up in inventory and depreciation and amortization.","We have summarized the year-over-year earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our second quarter 2017 press release.","Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for the Americas Group in the second quarter 2017 increased $196 million or 8.7% to $2.43 billion from $2.24 billion last year. The sales increase was primarily due to higher organic paint sales volumes across most end markets, the impact of the revenue reclassification and selling price increases.","Comparable store sales in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 4.9%. The change in the revenue classification is not reflected in comparable store sales.","Regionally, in the second quarter, our Southwest division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division, Eastern division and Canada division. Sales and volumes were positive in every operating division.","Segment profit for the group increased $33.3 million or 6.7% to $532.7 million in the quarter as higher architectural paint sales volumes and selling price increases were partially offset by higher raw material costs and continued challenges in the Latin America region.","Segment operating margin decreased to 21.8% of sales from 22.2% in the second quarter last year. If you exclude the change in the revenue classification, segment profit margin in the second quarter increased to 22.6%.","Turning to the Consumer Brands Group. Second quarter sales increased $74 million or 16% to $536.5 million due primarily to Valspar sales in June, partially offset by lower volume sales to most of the group's retail and commercial customers.","Segment profit per consumer brand decreased $27.1 million or 26.3% to $76.1 million in the quarter due primarily to acquisition-related inventory step-up and increased amortization cost totaling $20.5 million and lower sales volumes, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies, good expense control, and selling price increases.","Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 14.2% from 22.3% in the same period last year. Most of the impact in segment profit margin was from acquisition-related expenses and higher raw material costs.","For our Performance Coatings Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased $246.9 million or 48% to $761.1 million in the quarter due to Valspar sales for the month of June, higher coatings sales volume and selling price increases.","Stated in U.S. dollars, second quarter segment profit decreased $8 million or 11.4% to $62.3 million due primarily to acquisition-related inventory step-up and increased amortization cost totaling $38.3 million. As a percent of sales, segment profit decreased to 8.2% from 13.7% in the same period last year.","I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. In the Santa Clara County case involving public nuisance claims brought by 10 California cities and counties, we filed a Notice of Appeal in March of 2014, which was fully briefed by February 2015.","Last week, the Sixth District Court of Appeals for California scheduled the date for oral argument on the appeal for August 24th of this year. We believe a decision could be rendered by the Appellate Court within 90 days following oral argument.","That concludes our review of second quarter results for 2017. So, I will turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for third quarter and full year. John?","John Morikis","Thank you, Bob. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. I know the purpose of this call is to review the past three months. However, I think it's only fitting to open my comments this morning with some perspective on our future.","Sherwin-Williams and Valspar are now one company. As we said before, the combination of these two businesses will clearly differentiate us in the global paints and coatings market.","It significantly expands our brand portfolio and customer relationships in North America; creates a stronger, more global industrial coatings platform than either companies stand-alone; and extends our capabilities into new applications and geographies, including a scale platform to grow in Asia-Pacific.","Customers will benefit from our increased product range, enhanced technology and innovation capabilities, streamlined cost structure, and improved productivity. We have tremendous respect for the skill and dedication of the Valspar team and we're excited about the opportunities that this combination will provide to all employees of the new company.","The integration work is off to a very good start and although there are some obvious challenges to work through, we're genuinely excited about our future. Some of the challenges I'm referring to are apparent in our results for the second quarter and they affected both sales and profitability.","If you look at our results without Valspar, consolidated sales increased 4.2% over second quarter 2016, with a significant portion of the increase coming from the change in revenue classification.","Core gross margin declined 140 basis points year-over-year and SG&A as a percent of sales declined 110 basis points. If you adjust for the revenue classification, gross margin declined about 50 basis points and SG&A was down about 60. Adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points and adjusted profit before tax as a percent of sales improved to a record 17.8% from a comparable 17.5% last year.","Revenue and volume momentum in our North American paint stores slowed somewhat from the pace said in the first quarter. We often say that a strong week in June can make up for a weak first quarter. The opposite also tends to hold true.","While sales across all segments showed positive growth in the quarter, the sequential slowdown was almost entirely due to softer DIY sales both in the quarter and flat year-over-year exterior paint volumes in the month of June, primarily due to the volume declines in the last two weeks of the month.","As a result, exterior paint volumes in the quarter grew at roughly half the rate of interior paint, which is highly abnormal. The combination of weak DIY sales and weak exterior paint volumes negatively affected both revenue growth and mix. DIY is the highest gross margin segment in our stores business and the average selling price of exterior paint is significantly higher than interior.","On a positive note, sales to residential repaint contractors once again grew at a double-digit pace in the second quarter. Despite the softness in exterior paint, sales to all residential contractors combined, both new and repaint, grew nearly double-digits.","Exterior paint sales momentum appears to be rebounding in July, and we anticipate normal exterior painting activity over the balance of the season, which should support stronger comp stores volume growth in the months ahead.","The outlook for continued growth in both residential and commercial markets over the balance of the year remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor customers and healthy spray equipment sales in the quarter. Protective & Marine coatings sales also improved compared to second quarter last year, but grew less than our overall comp store growth rate.","Our business in Latin America was a significant drag on the results of the Americas Group segment. While sales and profitability in the Indian region and Southern Cone countries are showing steady improvement, our largest market in the region, Brazil, continues to struggle.","Sales through our company-operated stores in Brazil increased mid-single digits in the quarter, while sales through external retailers and distributors averaged double-digit declines.","Our efforts to mitigate rapidly rising raw material costs, particularly TiO2, with price increases has gained some traction, which should stem some of the erosion in operating margin.","During the first six months, we opened 27 net new stores and added 50 new sales territories in the U.S. and Canada and added six net new stores in Latin America. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,207 compared to 4,117 a year ago.","In Latin America, we currently operate 345 stores compared to 302 a year ago. Our plan for the full year still calls for the store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean compared to the 94 last year.","Consumer Brands Group, ex-Valspar, also posted another very disappointing quarter with declining sales across most product categories and market segments in most geographic regions. This weakness was particularly acute in Europe and in smaller retailer comps in the U.S. and Canada, but sales to all customer segments declined compared to second quarter last year.","In the U.S. and Canada, many retail customers report slow sales of architectural paint so far this season and many have scaled back inventories as a result. From a margin perspective, most of the operating margin decline was from lower gross margin, which was partly the result of raw material inflation and partly due to absorption loss from lower volumes.","Performance Coatings Group, excluding the Valspar results, was relatively flat year-over-year on both sales and margins. If you break down sales by geography, the strongest region by a wide margin was Latin America with strong volume growth in automotive finishes, wood coatings, general industrial and Protective & Marine.","Sales in the U.S. and Canada were relatively flat, and Europe and Asia were down year-over-year. This group has done a commendable job of managing SG&A spending and implementing price increases where necessary to offset raw material inflation. As a result, the group is geared to earn high incremental margins when we get volume growth on a stronger track.","So, the common theme running through all of our core businesses in the second quarter: not enough volume. Each of these businesses is well managed. Our expenses are in line. We have great pricing discipline and the most productive supply chain operation in the industry. Most of our shortfall in the quarter was related to weak volumes.","Valspar sales in the month of June were approximately $380 million, an increase of about 12% over June last year. A large portion of the increase resulted from a favorable calendar comparison, which added two shipping days to the month.","Operating margins for the Valspar paints business, which consists of architectural paint and related products sold in the U.S., Canada, Australia, China and the U.K., held up pretty well early in the year, but faltered in June.","The coatings business, which includes packaging coatings, coil coatings, industrial wood coatings, general industrial, automotive and protective and marine, saw significant operating margin compression year-over-year. Margin declines in both of these businesses were due primarily to the lag in implementing price increases to offset raw material inflation.","Given the spike in petrochemical raw materials early in the year, the large customer concentration of this business and the uniqueness of the situation over the past year, this lag is not entirely surprising. This issue is receiving a lot of attention and will take some time to address. But historically, these businesses have been successful at recovering raw material inflation due to the strong customer value propositions.","In the first six months of 2017, we generated $539 million in net operating cash, an increase of $29 million compared to the first half of 2016, driven by higher six-month net income and lower working capital requirements.","Year-to-date, capital expenditures totaled $84 million and we anticipate approximately $240 million in capital expenditures for the full year. Depreciation was $95 million and amortization was $35.1 million.","Total company borrowings on June 30 were $11.5 billion and our 12-month interest expense is projected to be approximately $400 million. Incremental depreciation and amortization step-up related to the Valspar acquisition is projected to be $275 million on an annual basis. Purchase accounting inventory adjustments of approximately $110 million are being amortized over three months of June through August 2017.","During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. At the close of the second quarter, our cash balance was $210 million compared to $403 million on June 30th, 2016. This cash will be used to reduce debt. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share, up from $0.84 last year.","On the first quarter 2017 earnings call, I said our expectations for average year-over-year raw material inflation was in the mid-single-digit and that outlook hasn't changed. As expected, the price volatility in resins, latex, solvents and packaging, caused by an uptick in propylene and tight supply of key monomers early in the year has moderated. Low TiO2 inventories will continue to drive modest inflation in pigments, but not likely to be on the range anticipated in our overall raw material outlook.","The price increases announced in our core Sherwin-Williams businesses continued to gain traction and we have not made any additional announcements. We will, however, continue to monitor changes in the raw material environment and will respond appropriately to changes as we go through the year. There's also little change in our outlook for paint and coatings demand.","Domestic architectural paint demand should remain strong throughout the year and worldwide demand for many of our industrial products, including protective and marine coatings, should continue to strengthen. These market factors create a positive backdrop, but our success will rely on accelerating volume growth through market share growth.","For the third quarter, we anticipate Sherwin-Williams' core net sales to increase in the low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to last year's third quarter. In addition, we expect incremental sales from the Valspar acquisition to be approximately $1 billion in the quarter.","At that anticipated sales level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the third quarter to be in the range of $3.70 to $4.10 per share. This includes a charge of $1.10 per share for costs associated with the Valspar acquisition. It also includes $0.40 to $0.60 per share accretion from Valspar operations, net of acquisition financing expense of $0.40 per share in the third quarter. As a reminder, third quarter 2016 earnings were $4.08 per share and included $0.24 per share charge for acquisition related costs.","For the full year 2017, we expect Sherwin-Williams' core net sales to increase by mid-single-digit percentage compared to full year 2016. In addition, we expect incremental sales from the Valspar acquisition to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2017. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance for full year 2017 diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $12.30 to $12.70 per share.","Full year 2017 diluted net income per common share guidance includes a $2.50 per share charge from costs associated with the acquisition of Valspar and an increase of $0.75 to $0.95 per share from Valspar operations.","The increase from Valspar operations is net of acquisition finance expense of $0.95 per share for the full year. Full year 2016 earnings per share was $11.99 and included $0.86 per share related to the Valspar acquisition.","Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and now we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi good morning.","John Morikis","Good morning.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi. In your Consumer Brands business, did the Valspar piece perform differently than the Sherwin piece? And is it reasonable to look at that segment as being down about 12% organically in sales in the quarter?","John Morikis","Well, let me take a stab at this Jeff and say that the weakness that we saw first in the quarter -- first quarter to second quarter was pretty broad based. And when you ask about how the performance is performing, there's obviously two components to it; our sales out our door and then to the retail customer themselves.","So I would say that -- to your question about how they're performing, I'd say out the door, our expectations are they're running in a similar pace from the PoS data that we can see from our customers, although, admittedly, that's limited. But in the door, I would say that our gallons are running shorter or smaller than Valspar's.","Allen Mistysyn","And Jeff this is Al. I would add. And part of the reason that is, just the tight inventory control that we're seeing across the channel due to what we believe to be general softness in the DIY market.","John Morikis","Yes, I'd say many of our customers in this segment are struggling to grow, and some are going backwards. And as a result they're managing their inventory.","Jeff Zekauskas","Are average prices in the Consumer Brands Group going up or down or staying flat?","John Morikis","Are you talking about our prices, Jeff?","Jeff Zekauskas","Well, both your prices and then how you look at it with Valspar when you look at it pro forma year-over-year.","Allen Mistysyn","Jeff, I -- we -- I don't think we've historically talked about pricing specific to the Consumer segment. We generally stick to our Paint Stores Group when we talk about, as an example, price increases. So, I just -- with the mix of products in that, I don't think it's appropriate to talk about specific pricing in consumers -- in our consumer segment.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Bob Wells","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Parkinson","Thank you. While you've been working on Valspar over a year, can you just comment on any initial surprises, either positive or negative, now that you've had almost two months full of the books and just in terms of product marketing, raw material procurement, culture and anything else you may find as an opportunity on a go-forward basis? Thank you.","John Morikis","Yes. I would say that we're very pleased. In fact, I'm probably more bullish about Valspar right now than I ever have been. I'll start with the quality of people. We've had the opportunity to spend more time from leadership all the way down to those customers that are closest to our customers. And I have to say that I have a lot of respect going into it. I'm really impressed and very pleased with the quality of people that we see.","We've not seen anything -- and you mentioned about synergies. We've not seen any in the first 45 days here that had me anything but excited and confident in our ability to deliver on the synergies that we've talked about. And I would say that as we've dialed in more and more into product quality and technology, it just feels like we're finding more upside as we go through that.","Now the one side I -- one point I will say that, to be completely transparent on the downside, is that I wish they would have been a bit more proactive in their pricing. If you look at the historical performance of Valspar and their ability to demonstrate the value to their customers and move with inflation, they had been very successful. And this is the same team that will be executing these price increases now.","I wish they would have been a bit more proactive. I can also understand after a year and a half of going through an FTC process that a lot of things get maybe pushed aside. But I'd say that we've got great confidence in the team, the value proposition. These are not commodities, these are terrific value to our customers and I wish they would have been a bit more proactive in that activity.","Chris Parkinson","And just a very quick follow-up. You just said on some key trends on pro versus DIY. But just within the pro market, can you just hit on any just broader comments in the performance of your customers across anything from resi and repaint, property management or even commercial? Thank you.","John Morikis","Sure, I'd say let's start with residential repaint. As we mentioned, we had a nice quarter. Again, that will be 13 to 15 quarters that we've had double-digit gains in our residential repaint. And as I mentioned, that's with -- what was going to be a terrific quarter. Last couple of weeks in June just crushed our exterior sales. And as I mentioned, those come along with a higher average sale price. So, we're really pleased with the momentum of our stores organization and the momentum that they have in that residential repaint team.","We've got phenomenal leaders, great products, great service and, most importantly, the right people close to the customers. So, we've got a lot of momentum and a lot of confidence there.","On the new residential side, we're really pleased with our momentum there as well. We have -- I don't know if I've ever -- we've ever shared this with anyone publicly here, but we've got exclusive agreements with 15 of the top 20 national builders here in the U.S. And yes, and I know the follow-up question, we are working on the additional five. We have that discussion on about a monthly basis. But we've got really good progress there and the value proposition and introducing new products and services to the new residential customers is going well.","And our commercial base is one where we've just got really good work course systems and our sales organization works very closely with that customer base. So, we're feeling very bullish about the momentum in the architectural business and really thrilled about our position, but not complacent. We're always challenging our team on how we're going to be better and more aligned with our customers in a differentiating way.","Bob Wells","Hey, Chris, this is Bob. And just because we're on the subject of painting contractors, let me break in. And because there's been a lot of debate on whether the labor supply issue is improving or staying the same. From our perspective, while it may be approving -- improving marginally in some regions of the country, I think in most of the country, we're still seeing pretty chronic labor supply shortages.","In the Southeast, Southwest and West in particular, those are the tightest regions and certainly, the impact on project count is pretty significant. Our contractor surveys in every region tell us that contractors would bid more work if they had more help. And most say they'd be willing to pay more to get more qualified labor. So the labor shortages that we've talked about for the last year and a half to two years don't appear to be behind us.","John Morikis","And I'd say the fact that they've got labor issues in some of these markets, they lean more on our people and our stores. So, it really fits well to our model.","Chris Parkinson","It's great color. Thank you.","John Morikis","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","John Morikis","Good morning Arun.","Arun Viswanathan","So, I just had a question on the guidance. So, I guess, just trying to understand the mid-single-digit comment for Q3 and the full year. So, does that kind of -- maybe you can parse that out on your expectations for Paint Stores Group and Consumer where historically, my understanding is that Paint Stores will be at the upper end of that and then Consumer potentially lower. Are you still expecting consumer to lag through the rest of the year and potentially show negative growth for the year?","John Morikis","I'd like Al to answer that, but I'd like to just begin with a question, your point about the consumer side. I think it's important to understand, we're working on these solutions that we think can help our customer and we're going to do that customer-by-customer. And as unsatisfying as this answer is to both you and us, and there's really no quick fix here.","The short-term solution of throwing promotional money at this problem is not a solution that we're pursuing. So, the long-term solution is to help our customers drive traffic and convert these footsteps into their -- in their stores into sales and help them to drive footsteps into their stores.","Allen Mistysyn","So, Arun, this is Al. The low to mid-single-digits in the guidance in the third quarter certainly has the impact of our tempered view of both the Consumer Brands Group, core business and the Latin America region. And when you look at the full year at mid-single-digits that would tell you that the stores group does have to perform up in that range. And we didn't come off the year on EPS on our core at $0.14, $0.15 and that's really driven by the flow-through we saw in stores.","So, if you look at our first half with our U.S. and Canada stores business, 7% same-store sales growth and -- I'm sorry, yes, 6% same-store sales growth and over a 30% flow-through. That would tell you that their second half has to be at a similar pace to achieve the $0.14, $0.15 with the tempered view of Consumer and Latin America.","Arun Viswanathan","Got it, that's very helpful. And then I guess, as a follow-up. Just curious with some of the other lag you've had over the last couple of years, protective and marine. You talked about the labor shortage and then price costs. Do you -- so your expectation as far as the question improves as the year unfolds. Do you still expect to achieve about 75% of the 5% price increase for the year?","John Morikis","Yes, we do and our practice of working with our customers through that process is continuing. And we often speak about the fact that we're not out there trying to jam a price increase in immediately. We work with our customers, and those phase in over in the Sherwin-Williams side in the six to seven-month period.","It might be a little bit longer on the OE side for Valspar. It might be a six to nine-month with some of the agreements that they have. But it is clearly our intention that these products, services and the total value proposition are going to allow us to continue to push those two. But we'll do it at the right place to retain our customers.","Bob Wells","Hey, Arun, a quick point of clarification. The range of price increases that we took in our stores was 3% to 5%. The average was about 4%, not 5%. So, 75% of 4%.","Arun Viswanathan","Got it. Thanks. And any thoughts on Protective & Marine, the outlook there?","John Morikis","Yes. We're actually feeling pretty good about our Protective & Marine, and we had a nice turn here in the quarter for our -- and particularly, our North America petrochem had some nice swing.","As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, slightly below our core business, but clearly moving in the right direction. And we're -- we've been talking in the last couple of quarters about the shift or pivot, as we call it, into some of these additional segments. We're getting very good traction there. There were a couple of segments that we see projects. We see them on the Board, but they've not been released primarily in the infrastructure. If you look at bridge and highway and water\/wastewater, there has been some projects that are in discussion, I'd call it, but have not been released.","The pressure -- and I also mentioned in Latin America, we saw a nice turn in our P&M business in Latin America. The two areas that we continue to see pressure in Protective & Marine, and albeit they're smaller businesses in relationship to our stores business, would be in Asia and in Europe. We continue to see pressure on our P&M business there.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks.","Bob Wells","Thanks Arun.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hey guys good morning. First off, going back to the weakness in exterior paint the last two weeks of June. Was that weighed upon by any particular region? There were parts of the country that were extremely hotter than the month of June. I guess, what are customers telling you in terms of the weakness there looking back?","John Morikis","Yes, the largest division that was impacted was our Southeastern division. These divisions take a lot of pride in competing with each other. And Southeast is -- has been one that has been leading the pack here for quite some time.","And I would say, going into the final lap here, if you will, of the third quarter, they were in a pretty good position, but they clearly felt the impact in the last couple of weeks. And our Southwestern division did a wonderful job in capitalizing on that opportunity and leading the pack for our stores organization.","Bob Wells","And because it was Southeast has been consistently one of the strongest demand regions in the country, we do not believe that the slowdown in exterior sales had anything to do with lack of demand. There is high demand for exterior projects in the market right now.","Ghansham Panjabi","Got it. And then even with the weakness in the consumer channel, you're still going to have to deal with higher raw material costs, I would imagine, going into 2018. Can you first give us a sense as to when the U.S. do-it-yourself paint channel realized a price increase? And then second, how do you plan on offsetting this -- the inflation that we're starting to see? Thanks.","John Morikis","Well, we're going to offset that by working with our customers on the need for our pricing and the timing. Al just spoke to the fact that we're bringing a little more clarity to our stores' pricing given that they are, in fact, our own stores. We prefer not to talk about pricing as it relates to our consumer business. But suffice it to say that the basket of raw materials are moving and we're talking with our customers about the needed price increases to offset that raw material basket shift.","Ghansham Panjabi","Got it. Thanks so much.","Bob Wells","Thanks Ghansham.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Byrne","Hi. Bob, your recent comments about pricing increases and so forth, is it fair to say out of that 5% same-store sales growth, 3% was price, 2% volume?","Bob Wells","About 200 basis points, price; the balance, volume, Steve.","Steve Byrne","And is there some drag on that from just a year-over-year mix shift having less exterior paint?","John Morikis","Well, the exterior and DIY, we had a soft DIY performance in our stores and, we believe, in the entire market.","Steve Byrne","And are you still lagging the raw material cost push? And do you expect that you'll be in a position to keep pushing price into 2018?","Allen Mistysyn","Just talking to the Paint Stores Group, I think the effectiveness that we've talked about in our price increase has been very good. I think as you talk about looking out, we're monitoring the raw material basket. And as we get a better line of sight to that, we would certainly talk to our customers first, like we have in the past. We'd also absolutely try to push back on our vendors or find our cost offsets in our own organization before we go talk to our customers. But then absent of those offsets, then we will talk to our customers first and then let you all know.","Steve Byrne","And then lastly, your 3% volume growth, how would you compare that to the overall architectural volume growth in the states?","Bob Wells","It's difficult to tell at this point, Steve, because we haven't heard enough public reports from the second quarter. It feels to us like DIY has been very slow. And the other comment I'd make is that while our exterior business was soft, we doubt we're the only one that felt the impact of slow exterior sales in the latter half of June.","John Morikis","I'd also say that the exterior business is oftentimes a contractor-applied product. There are certainly many DIY customers that apply their own exterior coatings. Let's say that many customers, when it comes to tackling a DIY project, would prefer that to be an interior versus exterior.","So, we may feel a little bit -- and again, this is on the shorter term, we may feel a bit more of a pinch on the exterior gallons, given our mix heavily towards the contractor. But we've got -- as Bob mentioned, we have a lot of confidence in the trend here and we don't feel this is a demand issue.","Steve Byrne","Okay. Thank you.","Bob Wells","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Koort ","Thanks very much. Good morning.","John Morikis","Good morning Bob.","Robert Koort ","John, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the synergy opportunity in front of you. You mentioned you've probably had a little longer than you like to look things over and potentially have less divestitures maybe than you could have feared from the regulators. So, can you talk a little bit about what you're finding now on the synergies and what the pace of that synergy capture will be?","John Morikis","Yes, I'd say, Bob, here in the first 45 days -- and to your point, while we had more time than we would have preferred, there were certainly limitations to what we were able to dial into out of respect to the proper process to the FTC.","And so truly, we've had about 45 days to dial in. And we're very confident in the numbers that we've posted on -- prior to the close about our ability, from a synergy standpoint, to drive those synergies through the organization and, importantly, as we believe, position the company for growth.","And so we feel as though we're trending well. We feel as though there's good engagement by both Valspar leadership and Sherwin leadership and making good decisions that allow us to extract out the -- what we call value capture and, at the same time and more importantly, position ourselves for growth.","Bob Wells","And I would say, Bob, we have about $50 million of synergies in our forecast for Valspar core. And when you look at that compared to what we talked about when we announced the acquisition, we had about $140 million in number in our first full year, so that's an annual number. You talk about $50 million -- around $50 million at a run rate. That's probably $100 million.","And as we get more clarity and are able to get more discussions across the selling organizations and looking at formulations in that, we'll have a better picture that we'll update guidance accordingly. And we'll give you a clear picture at the FCP conference in October.","Robert Koort ","Okay. And then if I might ask, on the architectural side, Valspar had different strategies, whether it was the embryonic business in Europe or what they're doing and China or even in Australia or maybe it was the combo of big-box and paint stores.","You see any opportunity to harmonize the go-to-market in architectural businesses outside the U.S.? Or what can they do differently under your ownership than they've been doing?","John Morikis","Yes, so we want to look at that, Bob. That's a great point. We want to start with a customer and work back, though, not just what we could bring to that. We do believe that there are terrific opportunities, if it's technology and from a supply chain standpoint, combined with what we think will be a far more efficient.","But the most important element here is the customer and so we're going through the process right now of working with our new team members from Valspar on the needs from the consumer and working back to what it is that we bring. And so we're excited about this. We think there are some opportunities. We're anxious to explore them. We've often referenced, you mentioned -- what might be the smallest market, but just because you mentioned it the Australian businesses we've -- they operate, I believe, 64 stores in Australia and we like -- we're anxious to bring some of the expertise that we have in running stores to that business.","But we're the first to admit that we're not experts in Australia. So, we're connecting dots here to make sure that what's needed in the market and the opportunity in the markets that the resources, the assets and skill sets that we have in our company.","Robert Koort ","Great. Thanks very much.","Bob Wells","Thank you, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks and good morning everyone. A couple of questions on the Valspar business. As we were watching the company report during that sort of purgatory period of the transaction, the results were coming in weaker than everybody forecasted, particularly on the consumer side of things. So, as you went back and once you were able to look under the hood, what was going on there? Was there destocking taking place? Or were they losing more shelf space, or what's the postmortem there?","John Morikis","I'd say that the thought of their losing shelf space, I mean, first of all, you mentioned the paints business, we were competing obviously with Valspar and one very large customer. And so there was -- there may have been some shift in there. I think as we've got -- been able to pull back the curtain, if you will, I'd say that the opportunities for growth are clearly there.","I don't know that the -- as I mentioned earlier, from a pricing activity standpoint, that they were as active as we would like to have seen. But from a volume standpoint, I wouldn't point to market share losses. I might say that they were experiencing, like we were, some softness in the market.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Just as a follow-up to that, as you look forward with that Valspar paints business, I mean, do you think you'll keep the Valspar brand? Or do you think you'll try to tie that volume into what you've been doing with Sherwin, with HGTV and with Infinity or maybe another application? But what would be the pros and cons of maintaining two brands -- a dual-brand strategy?","John Morikis","Well, it's a terrific asset. I mean, we wanted to build on that. We think there are customers of the Valspar brand that are eager to grow, and we want to help them, and we think that the Valspar brand is a terrific asset to help them do exactly that.","I mean, our goal would be to bring the technology and the combined services to each and every one of our customers to help them execute their strategy. And every customer is a little different. They've got different expectations and targets. And we think that combined the Sherwin-Valspar portfolio of resources, people, skills and technologies will allow us to separate from the competition.","And so I would expect that we're going to build on those. But I'd also say that we don't make decisions for our customers. We're going to work with them and help them to make the right decision to help them reach their goals.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thank you very much.","Bob Wells","Thanks Vincent.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","Thank you. John, I want to go back to your Valspar synergy comment. You said your confidence in your original $280 million assessment. But what were some of the main areas you couldn't look at until you close the company? As I look at manufacturing and distribution, that's only 8%. And looking at previous transactions you've done like Comex, logistics and consolidation and manufacturing plants tended to be a much bigger part of your synergies.","John Morikis","Yes. So, two. I mean, the first and largest would be the raw material costs. We're unable to look at raw material costs formulations. We're not able to look at formulations. And so when you talk about, are there possibilities for consolidation? You can't just look at a map and say, there's two facilities nearby. One is a candidate to be closed.","We try to understand the specific needs of every customer, which we were not -- unable to talk about, the specific technology that's manufactured in a plant, which we're not able to talk about, the raw material costs, the suppliers that they're using in those raw materials.","There's quite a bit that we were able to do and we're moving aggressively because they were within bounds and there were many areas that were out -- clearly out of bounds that we didn't get near.","Don Carson","And then a follow-up on capital deployment. There's still a lot of consolidation going on, on smaller industrial properties. Are you out of that market for now as you integrate Valspar? Or are you telling the Valspar people that if they see appropriate opportunities that they should continue to pursue them?","John Morikis","We're telling them that if they see opportunities we want to know them. We want to have those discussions. We've been very clear about -- in the short-term our focus is on paying down our debt. But often times -- it's not like we're going to the grocery store and buying something off the shelf.","I mean, these are discussions that we have for -- often times, we've had deals that I've worked on for five years. So, we want to know from each business leader, on a regular basis, those opportunities that they feel will help them by enhancing their value proposition to their customers and we want to engage in those discussions now.","Don Carson","Okay. Thank you.","Bob Wells","Thanks Don.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Duffy Fischer","Yes, good morning. Eventually, we'll kind of subsume Valspar in the reporting, but over the next year, we've got kind of work off their public numbers. If we just look at their last 12 months of revenue and going forward over the next 12, how fast do you see topline growing from them? And then maybe kind of help get faster in one of the segments versus the other.","John Morikis","Yes, it's -- it really does vary, Duffy, by region, by segment. We're excited about that. I don't want to give the false impression that it's going to happen overnight. I mean, we've got opportunities to -- in many parts of the world, we have a broader assortment of products and technologies. But we're going to have to have a supply chain to be able to transfer some of those products. We're going to have to get our sales organization up to speed and aware of the technology.","And so there's a whole lot of work going on right now and trying to accelerate that as quickly as possible. And then those were some of the things that we talked about before the close of how we were going to go about that. So we're executing on those plans right now, but it really does vary very much by segment and by customer.","Bob Wells","And Duffy, I would say if you look at our guidance, the $2.5 billion for the June through December. You got to remember, they're on a 4-4-5. So, we tried to make their last year comparable to ours, and with that, we think we'd be flat to up slightly, which I think is right in the range of what they've been running.","Duffy Fischer","Okay, great. And then just rolling LatAm into the Paint Stores Group, is that doing anything structurally to how you're running LatAm?","Bob Wells","No, I think what we talked about a few years ago was that Latin America, we moved under the Paint Stores Group management team and created the Americas Group back then. We just didn't report it that way. So, with a larger company, Latin America gets to be about less than 5% of our sales and profit, much less than that even, unfortunately. But it didn't make sense leave them as a separate segment.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thanks guys.","Bob Wells","Hey Duffy.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","PJ Juvekar","Good morning John.","John Morikis","Hi PJ.","PJ Juvekar","So, your Consumer Group continues to underperform, sales are down 11%, and I think you said it was broad based. So, I guess, my question is, what is all of this weakness in DIY? Is it that consumers are spending less on paint? Maybe they're spending more on Amazon or something like that?","John Morikis","No, I would say that there's certainly a shift from do-it-yourself to do-it-for-me that's likely accelerated. It's -- often times, when you talk about a consumer, little difficult to put your fingers right on what it is that's driving the slowdown in do-it-yourself.","What we're focused on here, PJ, is ensuring that our customers are at the best position to be able to capitalize on the business that does exist out there. There's terrific market share, as we said in review with each of our customers, their goals and providing the lineup of products, brands and services to help them is what we're focused on to be able to do that.","Bob Wells","At the risk of belaboring the obvious, PJ, we -- while we don't like to see our DIY business in our stores slowing down, we are the beneficiaries of this shift from DIY to do-it-for-me. John mentioned in his opening comments that we've seen 13 in the last 15 quarters of double-digit growth in our Pro residential repaint business. We think that's a reflection of more people hiring professionals as opposed to doing it themselves.","PJ Juvekar","Okay. So, you don't think there's an issue about dollars being spent on paints or painting in general?","Bob Wells","No. Actually, we think that painting activity is pretty strong right now. As strong as it can be, given the labor shortages in the contractor market.","PJ Juvekar","Okay. And then on your synergies -- just on your synergies, are there any true revenue synergies between the two companies? And what I mean by that is are there any Valspar products like cabinet stains that you are beginning to sell through your stores?","John Morikis","Well, we wouldn't want to comment on that specifically. I don't think that's happening. But the point here is that we do see opportunities on the synergy side for us to capitalize. And while we're excited about them, PJ, those are not issues that we're going to lay out right now. But I will tell you that by business unit, as we're bringing these teams together, we went in with some idea and some mindset of where those opportunities are.","And I would say, right now, we are very excited about as these teams have come together, the opportunities that they've identified that we haven't even thought of yet. So, we're feeling very good about those opportunities and the momentum. It's going to take us a little time to capture those, but we feel good about what we're finding.","PJ Juvekar","Okay. And lastly, can you give an update on how did HGTV paint do in the second quarter?","John Morikis","Well, we reported our consumer numbers. The HGTV paints specifically, we don't speak to, out of respect to our customer. We allow our customers to report their results. But we did report our consumer results and have clearly indicated that while we feel as though the market is a tough market, we want to see better performance from our team. And they're working very hard, and we have high expectations for them to outperform the market.","PJ Juvekar","Okay. Thank you.","Bob Wells","Thanks PJ.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Sison","Hey guys. Thanks. John, you kind of opened up talking about the long-term potential for the combination. When you think about the drivers for 2018 and which is generally, a little bit long away. But when you think about those drivers to generate earnings growth, can you maybe talk about what you're excited about? And what type of growth we could see?","John Morikis","Yes, I'm excited about every business that these Valspar and Sherwin-Williams teams have come together and touch. I mean, if you look at the complementary nature of these businesses, they offer technology and resources.","In many cases, they may be strong where we're not and vice versa. There's areas of strength that we have that they lack, either scale or facility. The combination of the product lines, the relationship with customers. We're excited to be a more meaningful part of the relationship with many customers, where they may have had an OE direct relationship and our focus has been on the tier suppliers into, ultimately, the OE customer.","And so we think the combination of people, technologies, the resources, the assets, the facilities that we have, I mean, every single business, when we sit and talk in these meetings and Allen and I are working with them on a regular basis. And we walk away really, really excited about where we're headed here.","And we're pushing hard to get it as fast, but we have a common theme that we're constantly repeating, which is we want to push hard to get it right, not just fast. And so we don't want to making commitments to our customers or to the financial community, but more importantly, to the customers that we can't keep.","And I'll add 1 thing to you that is if you look historically at the performance of Sherwin-Williams and our ability to integrate in these facilities and technologies, I don't want to give the impression that it's just out there somewhere. I mean, we move quickly. We're moving aggressively. We just want to make sure we get it right. So, I don't give you the wrong impression there.","Mike Sison","Right. And just a quick, quick question on Valspar. You gave a sales for 2017, $2.4 billion. And I think you mentioned that would be kind of flattish up year-over-year. Is -- will earnings, ex synergy, for Valspar be up, flattish or down?","Allen Mistysyn","No, Mike. I would say that the earnings would be a continuation of what you saw in the first half on that trend that was reported. Just to be clear on what we reported for Valspar operations is their operations, less their legacy, their legacy debt would be included in that and then less the new debt acquisition financing.","But ex the synergies and the financing, I think it'd be down. And primarily because you saw that in the gross margin in that the pressure they saw in the raw material costs. And there was typically a lag in their business in getting price and we're seeing that lag and then some. So, certainly, we're challenging our groups to get out and develop what that pricing action has to be with the customers.","Mike Sison","Great. Thank you.","Bob Wells","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott your line is live, you may proceed with your question.","Scott Mushkin","Can you guys hear me?","John Morikis","Hey, Scott. Yes.","Scott Mushkin","Great. Can you guys hear me now? Yes, okay. So, I just wanted to -- and I know the call has gone a long time, but I guess you didn't, maybe I missed to catch why you guys thought we had to slowdown in exterior in the Southeast for two weeks? And why you're so -- it seems like you're pretty confident it's just going to go away, and maybe it already has in July. But I'm just wondering the why.","Bob Wells","It -- as we said, it was in the Southeast and a little bit in the East. And the why, all we've said is the why was not lack of demand. And we have a practice of not talking about things like weather on conference calls, but you can't paint outside in the rain. And I think I'll leave it at that.","John Morikis","Yes, I'd say we were going in the last two weeks of June and came out in July very strong. We had two very difficult weeks and primarily our Southeastern division that really -- and as we mentioned this sell price and volume and everything, the contractor purchases of exterior, it really had a significant impact on our business.","Scott Mushkin","Okay, great. That's good color. So, then my next question, and maybe I'm traveling today, so maybe I'm missing it, seems like you guys have a lot of confidence in your back half with your core Sherwin business, is that true?","And I guess, the thought process I have, I -- we -- DY -- do-it-yourself has, I think, a big impact on the summer quarter even for you guys. I think it's where you sell the most. So, I was just wondering if you can kind of talk us through why it seems like there's a decent amount of confidence going into the back half? And am I right about that? And what's driving that?","John Morikis","Yes, I would say it's safe to say that you should sense a level of confidence. And you talked about our stores organization, again, not to be too repetitive, but we're finishing 13 of 15 quarters in this residential space with a double-digit gain and we feel as though we're really growing share there. And we're really trying to put our foot on the pedal and go even faster.","And our teams are really executing there and I think the alignment that we have in developing products and services and working with our customers is really allowing us to grow share. And I'm not -- we're not talking about is that going to slow down? We're talking internally that how we accelerate. We want to go harder and faster and further separate ourselves from our competition.","I mentioned the penetration that we have in new residential. And so if you're like us and have confidence in the need for housing and starts and you reflect back on the fact that we've got these exclusive agreements with 15 of the top 20 builders. Yes, we're feeling good, and we're trying to grow that number, the number of builders on both the national and regional level. That we've got the right products that work for the national builders and we're trying to further leverage that for the regional builders.","So, I mean, I can go segment-by-segment, but yes, we're feeling really good. But as I said, great people in the field, taking care of customers and we want people feeling as though our people and our stores and our reps are an extension of their business, and our people are doing a terrific job at that. We're very grateful for their efforts.","Bob Wells","I would add to that, though, because you specifically point out DIY. On the DIY side of the market, which would include a component of our Paint Stores business and our Consumer Brands Group, probably less confident. We think we're seeing softness in the DIY market. So, that growth is going to be a little more challenging there.","Scott Mushkin","Okay. May I let it go and have another question. I'll just take it offline. Thanks guys.","Bob Wells","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Rednor","Hi good morning.","Bob Wells","Good morning Scott.","Scott Rednor","Good afternoon at this point. Just had a curiosity relative to -- I know you guys haven't explicitly disclosed, but relative to any headcount synergies between the two companies. Can you maybe just give us a framework for what percentage of the way through or completed you are? And maybe, John, can you just kind of give us a sense for what the morale is now that the two organizations are officially brought together?","John Morikis","I'd say that the morale is very good. We're very transparent and open with our employees and our teams about the process that we're going through. We're not going to -- and I hope you respect, Scott, we're not going to speculate about percentages of where we are or where we are not in the process, respect to our teams and our people. Those are discussions that we have directly with them. We're anxious to get this behind us. We have good momentum, but those aren't discussions that we're going to have.","Allen Mistysyn","Scott, I would say if you look at the $50 million that we have in our guidance and the run rate that implies that $100 million you'd say on a three -- 120 gross run rate in year three, we're a third of the way there. So, we feel pretty good about that progress.","Scott Rednor","And when you think about the strategy, particularly at Lowe's, now that you have two of the power brands there, can you maybe just talk broadly about any changes in kind of the go-to-market strategy?","John Morikis","Our strategy for Lowe's?","Scott Rednor","Correct.","John Morikis","No, -- yes, we're not going to talk about that, Scott. I mean, again, that's a very important customer of ours and I hope you'll, again, respect that those discussions between us and Lowe's and their strategy, I mean, that's -- it's important to that each and every one of our customers respect that those are confidential discussions and our job is to help them execute on their strategy.","Scott Rednor","Okay. I guess, just lastly then, John. I think you made a point about pricing and in the Industrial Coatings business is an area that has kind of trailed expectation, but reasonably so, just given that the deal has taken some time to close. I think previously, when you guys have gotten into businesses that were a little bit different than Paint Stores you've been very slow to implement price increases if I go back to, Sayerlack or Becker. And over time, you created a lot of value, but that took some time to come through the P&L as maybe the financial community saw it.","Is this a different situation? Is that the right blueprint? I'm just kind of curious if this means you could do something more immediate than what we saw as that kind of blueprint.","John Morikis","Well, I'd say that you're exactly right, Scott and very observant. You know our company well. And historically, we've always taken that approach, which is we're going to work with our customers through that process. And the acquisitions that you described were, in fact OEM suppliers mainly. And so we worked with those customers.","Our goal is to always come through the tunnel with our customer and the price. And so we work appropriately with our customers to ensure that the value proposition is there for them and their ability to enhance the value of their products through that process. So, you're right, it's going to take a little bit of time.","As I mentioned earlier, we've typically looked at a Sherwin cycle of maybe taking six to seven months to implement a price increase. And on the Valspar side, it might take six to nine months. But the value proposition is strong. The same teams are the ones executing, the same products and technologies. And so we've got confidence in our ability to do that, but we're not going to lose our heads and go out there and try to do it overnight. We want to keep our customers.","Scott Rednor","Great. Thanks for time.","Bob Wells","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Stephen Eastwood with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen East","Thank you. Good afternoon guys. John there's been -- you've had a lot of questions asked about price and trying to reaccelerate your back half of 2017. Before the merger actually occurred, a lot of talk about raw material purchasing benefits, et cetera. Haven't really heard any conversation on that. So as you look at the second half of 2017, how big a part -- how would you sort of rank order where that raw material purchasing synergy would be in improving your volumes or your up margin as you go forward?","John Morikis","Yes, Steve, it's a good question. I might answer a little differently and that is referencing back to the previous question. We have confidence and we've not seen anything that keeps us from being anything but confident in our ability to reach the synergy targets that we have.","They're going to lay in -- Al mentioned that run rate that we're at. I don't think it's in our best interest to parse out where we are on each of those individual synergy buckets as we're pursuing them, but you should expect raw materials was a big one. You should expect that we're being very aggressive in pursuing those and our goal is to try to capture those as quickly as possible.","Stephen East","Great. Okay. Fair enough. And then I know we've beat consumer like a dead horse here, but I'll ask you one more. The segments didn't hunt down as much as you all have been the first half of the year. What do you think is going on? You've talked about not just using promo dollars to try to recapture but to drive. So, what do you think was going on in your business that maybe wasn't happening in some of your peers that you got to correct?","John Morikis","Well, we're always interested in improving our performance. I do have to -- I think it's important to make a statement here that I believe that, again, with limited PoS data, we don't see all the data from our customers. I would tell you that our sell-through at retail is in line with what we believe to be the rate of the DIY market.","I do think that the inventory connection -- correction may have been a little stronger on some of the products as we've walked into some of these programs. And at the same time, while we're learning about the program, our customers are experiencing a little softer market than what we would like to see. And so I think there's been some adjustment accordingly. But as far as the market goes, I think our out-the-doors are performing similar to what we expect the market is performing.","Bob Wells","The other point I'd point out, Steve, is that segment includes a business unit in Europe. So, it may not be an apples-to-apples comparison looking at our volumes versus our peers. Europe, the second consecutive quarter, was the weakest performing part of the Consumer segment. So, we're getting a drag from overseas.","Stephen East","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Bob Wells","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Matt on for Kevin. I just have two one's for you. Your management teams across the space have indicated kind of 2Q is probably the peak for raw material pressure on the year. As we look into 3Q and 4Q, just given the lags, kind of how much of an actual decline do you expect to see of this Q2 peak?","Bob Wells","Matt, this is Bob. The change in raw material cost year-over-year probably peaked in the second quarter. That's only because we're starting to annualized price increases from last year. We did see chemical-grade propylene settle back after a pretty significant spike in the first quarter and we don't expect any major swings over the balance of the year. So that's probably good news.","But MMA remains very tight. TiO2, we're probably going to see more traction on pricing in the TiO2 market. So, I don't expect raw material -- the basket to decline. In fact, the basket, we're going to see a little incremental inflation going forward. It's just that the compare gets easier as we go forward. So, our outlook for the full year is still mid-single digits, but we don't see a lot of goodness in the back half in the way of deflation. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And Valspar had another business, which housed corporate costs and adhesives businesses. Kind of where the earnings from that adhesives business is going now? And can you quantify how much earnings that business generates versus what the prior corporate cost was on an absolute level?","Allen Mistysyn","Matt, the -- their -- with their resin and colorants business that was in that Admin [ph] segment is now in our Performance Coating segment. But no, we won't be breaking the specifics of the segment profit out for that business.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, and corporate costs just got tallied into your own? It's that what I'm guessing.","Bob Wells","That's correct.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander","Two very quick ones. Just on the regional same-store sales comments you made in the beginning, can you talk just a little bit, can you characterize the dispersion between your best regions and your worst regions? And is that dispersion, any wider than normal?","And secondly, with respect to share gains that you're going after in the back half of the year and going forward, are there any areas where you are reversing a trend rather than building on momentum you already had?","John Morikis","Let me answer that last one. I'd say the area that we started to see some positive that would still may be characterized as reversing, I would say, would be the Protective & Marine. That has been under pressure for a couple of years now. And this -- we clearly saw a shift in the petrochem, and there's still more opportunity there. And I'd say that there's -- I'd characterize that in that manner. Regarding the -- I'm sorry, the division question you had was.","Allen Mistysyn","Geographic dispersion of results from -- in the five regions.","John Morikis","Yes. So, you talked about the gap between them?","Bob Wells","Yes.","John Morikis","I don't --","Bob Wells","Well, high single-digits in the strongest region to low single-digits in the weakest, all being positive on revenue and volume.","Laurence Alexander","I guess, where I was getting at is, is that any different than what you normally see?","John Morikis","It's -- that's -- there's always a little bit of a gap, I'd say.","Allen Mistysyn","Might be a little bit wider--","John Morikis","A little wider maybe. ","Allen Mistysyn","Than usual.","Laurence Alexander","Okay. Thank you.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts","Thanks guys. Were any synergies in wood coatings in the original $280 million? Or were you assuming you're divesting that all along?","Allen Mistysyn","There -- in the original, there probably was some, John, but not significant enough on a $225 million business on a $4.2 billion company to matter.","John Roberts","Okay. And then the inventory write-up sounds like you'll completely flushed by the August period. Is the fourth quarter going to be -- as you see it right now, there's no unusuals in the fourth quarter, at least in your full year guidance. It's there. Maybe something might change by then, but at least in your guidance right now, is there any year end significant accruals for compensation or something that might affect comparability in the fourth quarter?","John Morikis","No, not right now.","John Roberts","Okay. Thank you.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Perrella","Hi, good afternoon. Quick follow-up, housekeeping. When will we see more pro forma data? What's the timing on that?","Allen Mistysyn","I think, Chris, what we're prepared to do is at the FCP Conference, we'll give you more color and more guidance on the performance of Valspar and the combined entity and the synergies that are occurring. I think after 45 days, it's a little tough to have a lot of confidence in some of the things that we just thought. So, we're shooting for the FCP Meeting.","Christopher Perrella","Okay. Thank you very much.","Allen Mistysyn","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Good afternoon guys. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I'd just like to follow-up a little bit. I know it's a small segment for you, but Latin America saw negative -- or negative operating profit in three of the last six quarters and a pretty big step-down in the profitability this quarter. Is it all sort of timing of raw materials? Are there other some issues with volume growth or declines? Can you talk about sort of why that business performed as poorly as it did on the margin line in the second quarter? And what should we look forward to in the second half of the year?","Allen Mistysyn","Dmitry, the -- when you look at our Latin America region, Brazil is the largest portion of that business. And as you well know, that it's just been in turmoil. So, you see a lot of short-term choppiness. We expect that to continue over the short-term.","Over the long-term, that market, it's the ninth largest economy. As they work their way through the turmoil and regain their footing, we expect that to be a good market for us and expect to see growth and a return to the profitability of that region.","John Morikis","Yes, I'd say Latin America, outside of Brazil, we see a good trend. We're growing our share and financials are pointing in the right direction. And to Al's point, Brazil is such a big percentage of -- the weight of Brazil on our overall South American operations is pretty heavy.","Dmitry Silversteyn","And can I follow-up? I think you mentioned that in your Coatings segment in your Industrial Coatings business, you identified Latin America as sort of a good guy in terms of delivering strong growth. So, kind of why the discrepancy between the Industrial segment and the Consumer segment in that economy? I would imagine that both would be impacted by the political turmoil.","John Morikis","Yes, you're exactly right. And let me add one more. Our store performance, our own store performance in Brazil is actually positive performance as well. Such a big part of that business, Dmitry, is third-party through home centers and distributors, and they're calling on consumers. And the consumers' confidence in that market is clearly shaken.","But you're exactly right. If you look at our automotive, our wood business, our general industrial and Protective & Marine businesses in Latin America, they were all positive. It's the architectural consumer business that's under pressure.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay, that's helpful, John. And then just as a quick follow-up on Industrial Coatings business, particularly the Valspar piece of it, which has been decelerating pretty meaningfully in terms of margin in the last couple of quarters and through the last reportable segment that they had or the reportable period that they had.","You mentioned sort of lack of productivity on price increases. Was that the main driver of lower margins? Or was there some mix impact there? And how do you feel about that in the second half of the year? Can you at least stem the declines and kind of stabilize them at these levels before price increases kick in what sounds like in 2018?","John Morikis","Yes, I'd say we're going to continue to feel pressure through the end of the year. I'd like to say they we're going to be able to turn this around quickly here, Dmitry. But I think, this is a process when you're involved in these acquisitions.","First of all, it was a very long FTC process, and sometimes people get a little distracted, and I respect that. And quite frankly, you have competitors that are in there trying to create opportunities. And so we always see this as well. The competition kicks up for a short -- for a little bit and they're aggressive and so we feel some pressure. And they've done the right thing. They've hung on to the business. The volume is actually hanging in there. It's the gross margin that's under pressure.","And so as I mentioned earlier, and again, I don't want to be repetitive, but we've got great confidence in these leadership teams that are now part of our team. And these are the same leaders and same product services, as I mentioned earlier. And it's up to us to continue to demonstrate the value proposition to our customers and to earn that incremental margin to offset the raw material costs and we've got confidence in our ability to do that.","Historically, they've been able to do that. Everything's consistent and we're going to continue to work towards that. We're going to do it at the right pace.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Got it. Okay John thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Harrison","Hi good afternoon.","John Morikis","Hey Mike.","Mike Harrison","John, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on how you and the regulators arrived at the Valspar wood coatings business is the piece that would need to be sold. And can you maybe talk about the approach to the industrial wood coatings market going forward? Is that something that you can attack in North America with just the legacy Sherwin position?","John Morikis","Well, your first question about how did that we arrive with the regulators, I mean, that's a normal process review, which we're very respectful for the process that the government goes through, and we responded to all their requests. The did their due diligence, including not only our information, but Valspar's, but also customer information and they made a decision.","And while we may have had a different opinion in many areas, and that is part of the process, you're able to express your thoughts, ultimately, they made a decision and we had to respect that. And so we find ourselves now exactly where the FTC would want us, which is in a competitive situation with the new entrant.","And yes, you're exactly right, we're going to compete for that business and I don't think the FTC or any other government agency would have it any other way. The competition is good for the consumer and we're going to be out there looking for that -- those customer relationships.","We have a good industrial wood business or they would not have required us to divest the one that they required. So, our teams are going to be working hard to try to grow their business. And some of those customers will certainly be legacy Valspar customers. But I'll say this tongue-in-cheek, we don't discriminate. We'll take customers anywhere we can get. So, we'll be working hard with all customers' opportunities.","Mike Harrison","All right. And then was just curious, in the consumer brand's business, have you received any clarity from some of the retailers that you sell through about how they're going to address multiple brands potentially in the same product category now being under the same ownership? Is that the situation where you could expect to potentially lose some incremental shelf space?","John Morikis","Or gain -- or gain share. We're having those discussions every day. And again, it goes back to the same value proposition. It's upon us to help our customers be successful. That's our goal. That's how we measure our success. Our success is making our customers successful. So, we're making those discussions every day. And we've talked openly about the need for volume.","And so while we talk about value capture, raw material costs, all those things, the day starts and ends with discussions about growing volume and growing sales and we do that by aligning ourselves with our customers.","Mike Harrison","Thank you.","John Morikis","Yes, thank you.","Bob Wells","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Thank you for joining the Sherwin-Williams Company's Review of the Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results and Expectations for the Full Year. With us on today's call are Chris Connor, Chairman and CEO; Sean Hennessy, Senior Vice President, Finance and CFO; Al Mistysyn, Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Bob Wells, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications and Public Affairs.","This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode via Vcall via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after this conference call concludes, and will be available until Thursday, November 14, 2013, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time.","This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which the statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the review of the third quarter results, we will open this session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.","Robert J. Wells","Thanks, Rob. In order to allow more time for questions, we provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at sherwin.com, under Investor Relations third quarter press release.","Summarizing overall company performance for the third quarter 2013 versus third quarter 2012, consolidated net sales increased 9.4% to $2.85 billion, due primarily to higher paint sales volumes in our Paint Stores Group.","Acquisition increased consolidated net sales 1.1% in the quarter, and unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales 0.8%. Gross profit dollars increased $145.7 million to $1.3 billion. Gross margin increased 130 basis points to 45.5% of sales from 44.2% in the third quarter last year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved fixed cost absorption from increased sales volumes that were partially offset by import duty assessments related to our Brazilian operations. These import duty assessments reduced gross margin by 60 basis points in the quarter.","Selling, general and administrative expense for the quarter increased 11.2% to $889.7 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 31.2% in the third quarter this year from 30.7% last year. Incremental SG&A from new stores, customer service investments and acquisitions accounted for the majority of the SG&A increase in the quarter.","Interest expense increased approximately $5 million to $15.4 million, due primarily to prefunding of the Comex acquisition. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $44.5 million, or 13%, to $387.5 million. Profit before tax as a percent of sales increased to 13.6% from 13.2% last year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter this year was 32.1%, compared to 31.5% in the third quarter of 2012.","Year-to-date, our effective tax rate is 32.1%, which is in line with our expectation for full year 2013. Consolidated net income increased $28 million to $263 million compared to $235 million in the third quarter of 2012. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 9.2% from 9% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 13.8% to $2.55 per share from $2.24 per share in the same period last year.","Third quarter 2013 reported EPS includes the Brazilian import duty assessment, which decreased diluted net income per common share $0.13 in the quarter. Currency translation increased earnings per share in the quarter by $0.02 and acquisitions reduced earnings per share $0.02.","Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the third quarter increased 13.5% to $1.76 billion. Higher paint sales volumes across all end market segments accounted for most of the increase in sales. Acquisitions increased sales by 1.5% in the quarter.","Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 10.9% in the quarter compared to the third quarter last year. Regionally in the third quarter, our Southeastern division led the sales performance, followed by Southwestern division, Midwestern division and Eastern division. 3 of the 4 Paint Stores divisions reported double-digit sales increases compared to last year.","Segment profit for the group increased $58.8 million, or 19.6%, to $359.4 million in the quarter, as higher sales volumes were partially offset by higher year-over-year selling, general and administrative expenses and dilution from the Comex acquisition. Acquisitions decreased segment profit by $2.6 million. Operating margin increased to 20.4% from 19.3% in the third quarter last year.","Turning to our Consumer Group. Sales in the third quarter increased 5.4% to $366.8 million, due primarily to the timing of seasonal shipments to some customers. Acquisitions increased Consumer Group net sales 0.2% in the quarter. Third quarter segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $16 million or 28% to $73.1 million, due primarily to higher sales volume and improved operating efficiencies.","Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 19.9% from 16.4% in the same period last year. For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 3.1% to $507.3 million in the quarter, due primarily to selling price increases and acquisitions.","In the quarter, acquisitions increased net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately 1.3%, and unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased sales by 0.4%. Stated in U.S. dollars, third quarter segment profit increased $8.1 million, or 22.2%, to $44.5 million, due primarily to higher selling prices, improved operating efficiency and positive currency translation. Currency rate changes increased segment profit in the quarter by $3.4 million.","As a percent to external net sales, segment profit increased to 8.8% from 7.4% in the third quarter last year. For our Latin America Coatings Group, third quarter net sales in U.S. dollars were flat to last year at $208.6 million. Selling price increases and higher sales volumes in the quarter were offset by unfavorable currency rate changes. Unfavorable currency decreased net sales by 8.9% in the quarter.","Stated in U.S. dollars, segment profit decreased to a loss of $1 million in the quarter, compared to profit of $21.9 million last year, primarily due to charges related to an import duty tax assessment in Brazil. Charges of $19.8 million were recorded in the quarter to resolve a dispute by the Brazilian government over our handling of import duties through the year 2012.","We believe the second and third quarter payments to the Brazilian government totaling $31.6 million fully resolve all claims related to import duties.","Currency translation rate changes had no significant impact on third quarter segment profit. And as a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was a negative 0.5% from 10.5% in the third quarter 2012.","I'll conclude my remarks from the quarter with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. Arguments in the Santa Clara County case involving public nuisance claims brought by 10 California cities and counties against 5 defendant companies concluded on September 23. As a reminder, this is a bench trial. The outcome will be determined by the judge presiding over the case.","By statute, the judge has 90 days from the date of closing arguments to deliberate and render a judgment. At this point, we have no further indication or sense of timing on the decision.","That concludes our review of the results for third quarter 2013. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the remainder of the year. Chris?","Christopher M. Connor","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. The third quarter was another solid quarter for Sherwin-Williams in terms of sales momentum, profit improvement and cash generation.","Consolidated sales, net income and earnings per share each set new record highs for any quarter in our company's history. Net operating cash increased more than $100 million compared to the third quarter of 2012. It stands at just over 10% of sales through our first 9 months.","Excluding the import duty assessments in Brazil, our flow-through on pretax income was more than 37% through 9 months. Paint Stores Group continued to deliver strong year-over-year sales growth at the pace we believe is comfortably ahead of the market. Comp store revenue and gallon volume both posted strong double-digit gains in the quarter. And for the second consecutive quarter, segment profits, as a percent of sales, exceeded 20%.","Our investments in new store openings and superior store staffing continues to drive profitable market share growth for this team. Consumer Group reported solid sales growth in the quarter as well. It is somewhat by the timing of seasonal shipments to some customers. The strong profit performance in Consumer Group was the result of gross margin expansion from significantly higher manufacturing volumes, primarily to support Paints Service Group, as well as good SG&A expense control.","Our Global Finishes Group also turned in a strong profit performance in the quarter, despite weak demand in many regions where they compete in the world. Backing up the effects of acquisitions and currency, sales grew just over 2%, while segment profit increased nearly 13%.","Through 9 months, Global Finishes segment profit margin has increased 110 basis points, solid progress towards the double-digit operating margin target we've commented on in the past. Latin American Coatings Group continues to face significant headwinds from currency devaluation and softening market condition. Sales in local currencies and volumes were positive in the quarter, but segment profit continued to be pressured by weak currency and a tepid demand environment.","On the raw material front. Over the past few quarters, we've seen a steady stream of price increase announcements across a broad range of commodity categories. Many of the major chloride TiO2 producers announced first and second quarter price increases in the range of $0.10 per pound, followed by a third round of price increase announcements in September, with nominal effective dates around October 1.","Crude oil and propylene are also trading above their average pricing levels in the first half. Given the timing and impact of these announcements, we think that most of these increases are unlikely to gain traction over the balance of 2013. 2014 remains uncertain, and we will give more guidance on this topic during our year-end call in late January.","Our full year outlook for average raw material cost for the industry should be down low single-digits compared to 2012, still feels about right to us. Although input costs have shifted from a strong headwind to a slight tailwind over the past 24 months, the majority of a 130-basis-point increase in our third quarter gross margin resulted from volume-driven operating efficiencies in our global supply chain.","The SG&A spending was up almost $90 million in the quarter and increased 50 basis points as a percent of sales. Most of this increase was attributable to a higher service expense across our existing store base to 84 net new stores we've opened in the past 12 months, and incremental SG&A from acquisitions. We've commented in the past about the benefits of investing ahead of market growth. I clearly believe the SG&A investments we made in our Paint Stores Group in the back half of 2012 contributed significantly to the strong revenue and volume growth they've reported these past 9 months.","In the third quarter, we generated $476 million in net operating cash, bringing our 9-month net operating cash to $778 million. Our 9-month free cash flow, net operating cash, less CapEx and dividends, was $550 million. We continue to invest the company's cash to expand the controlled distribution platform, complete suitable acquisitions, increase our dividends, and purchase shares of stock from the treasury.","In the first 9 months, our Paint Stores Group added 42 net new stores, 20 of which were opened in the third quarter. In September, we completed the acquisition of the Comex business in the U.S. and Canada, which added 306 stores. We finished the quarter with 3,868 stores in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, compared to 3,478 stores a year ago.","Today, we're increasing our guidance for Paint Stores Group to accelerate net new store openings up to 80 to 90 during this year. In the third quarter, we bought back 1.5 million shares of our common stock in the open market, bringing our year-to-date total to 2.8 million shares at an average price of $175.72.","In September 30, we have remaining authorization require 13.65 million shares. Last week, our Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, up from $0.39 last year. On the eve of our second quarter earnings call, we received word that the Federal Competition Commission in Mexico had voted to block our acquisition of the Comex business in Mexico. Since that time, we worked closely with the regulatory authorities to secure approval and complete the transaction.","Last Tuesday, the newly seated competition commission held a hearing to consider our case. We expect the ruling within 5 business days of the hearing, and both parties stand ready to complete this transaction promptly if and when we receive regulatory clearance.","In the fourth quarter, the Comex stores in the U.S. and Canada should generate sales in the range of $95 million to $105 million, and earnings dilution of $0.20 to $0.40 per share. The wide range in earnings impact is due to uncertainty of the timing of various integration activities. A significant amount of the anticipated integration work in the U.S. and Canada will fall under calendar year 2014 as well, resulting in earnings dilution next year for this business. These stores should be accretive to earnings by 2015, and we will keep you posted on our progress throughout next year.","Without the Comex U.S. and Canada business, we expect fourth quarter 2013 consolidated net sales to increase 5% to 7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. With sales of that level, we expect core diluted net income per common share for the quarter to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.39 per share, compared to $0.65 per share in 2012, which included a $0.47 per share charge for our deal of settlement.","For the full year 2013, we expect consolidated net sales to increase by mid-single digit percentage over last year. With annual sales of that level, we're updating guidance for diluted net income per common share for the year to be in the range of $7 to $7.30 per share, including the Brazil import duty assessment and dilution from the domestic Comex business, compared to $6.02 per share earned in 2012.","Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. And now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Obviously, there's been some concern over the impacts of higher interest rates on some of the housing fundamentals here in the U.S. You obviously reported a very strong quarter regardless. So was there any sort of cautionary indicators that you saw during 3Q, either by geographic region or specific channel?","Christopher M. Connor","Ghansham, I'd say no. The pure suite we have on market demand is always through our Paint Stores Group. In recent quarters, the new residential segment has been our strongest performer, followed by residential repaint. So those are the 2 categories that would be impacted by any of that. And frankly, we're just not seeing any of that impacting our business.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then on Comex, you provided some parameters on 4Q. And Chris, you mentioned some commentary on 2014 in dilution as well. But how should we think about it on '14 on a quarterly basis?","Sean P. Hennessy","On a quarterly basis -- this is Sean Hennessy. And let me just try to give you a little more color on this, and maybe this will help you. We think instead of trying to look at the quarter through the first 12 months, let's take a look at the first 15 months. That would take us to the end of 2014. We think during that time frame, we'll lose $0.60 to $0.65 of this Comex U.S. and Canada piece. That would include all the synergy and the integration cost as well as -- right now, this asset is losing operating profit at this current time. But I think that $0.60 to $0.65 is all win. So when we get to calendar 2015, we'll have positive operating profits from this acquisition. So when you look at quarters, I think we'll try to give you a little more color by first, second, third, fourth quarter. But I think, especially when we try to give you that guidance of $0.20 to $0.40, if you ask the follow-up questions that mean if we did all $0.40, then next year would be $0.20 to $0.25, I'd say yes. If it becomes around $0.20 because of the integration costs not being able to be booked in the fourth quarter, then I think next year would be $0.40 to $0.45 by quarter, that's not exactly clear yet and as they're termed by a few things. But by 2015, we see this is a positive operating profit.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Nocella with RBC Capital Markets.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The increments of flow-through to earnings in the stores business was a little bit lower this quarter than the past years. Your SG&A ticked a little bit higher. So is this incremental margin progression kind of more in line with the normalized range? Or is there some upside maybe as you acclimate some new stores into your network?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I think after the second quarter's results, Chris, and stores posted over 50% incremental margin, we caution you not to get too comfortable with that number as much as we would like to see that. So I think what you're seeing in the quarter and the year-to-date numbers are more typical. We commented around that up to 30% incremental margin and more comfortable signing up to that through the remainder of the year.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got you. And on the Comex Mexico deal, it seems like you're still pretty confident that it gets done here. Do you think that it goes forward as originally planned or maybe will there be some concessions as you get that through?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. The last commission, we had gotten to a point with them where we had proposed remedies to address some of their concerns. I think it would be premature to comment on how this next commission will look at that. We're certainly aware of those remedies and maybe will be available to them, if necessary. And at this time, we're just not sure how it's going to go. We have commented that we remain optimistic and prepare to move forward. And hopefully next week, we're going to have some good news.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And just one last for me for my account. Just what spurred your decision to accelerate the store growth year-on-year?","Christopher M. Connor","Well I think we're seeing terrific results out of the group. Our confidence in the market is going forward. Over the next several years, we're going to be that we're going to continue to see high demand for these products as housing rebounds and we yet begin to see with any sustained volume, the rebound in the commercial markets, which will also impact that segment of the company as well. So I think you should read into that the confidence we have going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was hoping you could just comment, same-store sales last quarter were up about 7%, this quarter about 10%, 9%, so a pretty big acceleration. Is that real in that sequentially, it was improving that much? Or might it be that just last year was a lower base in Q3? What was the differential there in your mind?","Christopher M. Connor","I think you hit it. I think last year's second quarter was very, very strong in 2012. And the third quarter was the opposite. We probably had our weakest comp stores in 2012. So we felt pretty good about going up against that history in the third quarter. But I think when you look at the sales per store and so forth, we feel the market was pretty much the same in the third, as well as the second, really more has to do with the history.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just 2 quick questions on the Comex and the commission down there. First one is, are any of the people the same on this commission versus the first? And then the second is, is this an official process where they kind of have to give a declaration of the said time? Or is this something that they could reach out to you and kind of negotiate quietly, where they don't have to put out, say, a press release on this until it's finished?","Christopher M. Connor","Duffy, there are no commissioners seated on this body that were on the previous commission. So the answer to your first question is no. And then, secondarily, my understanding is, by Mexican law, they have 5 business days to respond to the case that was put in front of them. I don't think there's going to be negotiations at this point. I think we're just going to get an up or down vote.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you talk about the commercial or nonresidential market? I know it goes up with the lag, but what kind of growth are you seeing or you could see in 2014?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, P.J. What we're seeing is kind of a staggered start of the commercial market. You're correct that it typically moves with the 12- to 18-month lag to residential. We are seeing that pickup in certain nonresidential categories, like office space and hospitality have been relatively strong. That strength has been offset by weakness in retail in some of the manufacturing segments, and anything that relies on public funding is pretty soft. So schools, libraries, government buildings, et cetera, has been very weak year-over-year, actually, down pretty significantly year-over-year. So it's a mixed bag. But in total, it's just barely better than flat thus far. We do expect to pick up in many of those other categories, and we'll see growth in the market when that happens.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And your same-store sales in Paint group were up 10.9%. Even that there was very little pricing this year, is it all volumes? And could you -- also can you make a quick comment on what you're seeing in DIY with this contractor?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. So I think, P.J., we've been commenting all year that all of the growth is, in fact, Vi [ph] is running a little bit higher than sales because we have some mixed shift in the business. We've commented that the new residential business is leading the pack, and that's by design is the lower average selling price per gallon. So a little deflationary pricing in the mix. So with the 10.9% revenue from the comp stores, the volume was actually stronger than that. So again, we can expect that to continue going forward. DIY has been a good story for us as well. It lags a little bit. The residential new construction and residential repaint segments, but it's been a strong contributing performer for the company now for several years.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color about the Consumer Group. I saw the comments about the timing of certain sales. How much of an impact does that have on the group? And is there any way to adjust for that and figure out what sort of the trend is?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. So I think that we've been commenting that as a result of the loss of these 2 types of business that we're anniversarying, both the Walmart domestically and Home Depot in Mexico, that this business was going to be off slightly low-single digits down in revenue for the year. We've been chalking [ph] at that through the first 2 quarters. We did see a spike in kind of shipments as we commented. Most of that happened in the last month of the quarter. And so that was kind of the timing comment. We would expect that the fourth quarter will be back to kind of that soft performance. So nothing really different there in terms of the company job [ph] position or program, and just riding along with the friends of [ph] customers we enjoy in that business.","Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just a couple of housekeeping items. Were there any significant diesel [ph] or closing cost regarding the Comex North America businesses and the SG&A line or elsewhere? And could you give the gross profit year-over-year change by segment?","Sean P. Hennessy","Sure. When you look at the Comex, we commented that it was $0.02 in the quarter. And that $0.02 is really imposed. It's all-in at $0.02. We're probably not going to break out gross margin and SG&A at Comex for 1 month. On the incremental dollars, the gross profit dollars that we will have in the Q. Store Group was up $129 million. Consumer was up $17 million. Global was up -- segment was up $13 million. LACG was down $12 million, and as from that Bob's script and Chris also mentioned that was depressed by approximately by $20 million due to the Brazilian situation. So without the Brazilian tax situation, LACG would have been up high-single digits.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could guys talk a little bit about why Comex's business isn't making an operating profit. It seems most of the times, when you buy regionalized businesses, they've done well. So is it just their spread too far? Their density is not high enough? What is it about the business that's not as currently profitable that other acquisitions have been?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I would say their spread in density, Bob, is terrific, actually. They've got really good brand recognition, store locations and penetration in the geographies that they're operating in. This is a business that, at the time of Comex's acquisition, was really focused on new residential construction, almost fully. And last, the product line and\/or the discipline to really expand into all the other professional painting contractor segments and DIY that have been kind of the hallmark of the Sherwin-Williams Paint Stores. Over the years, their timing was a little bit unfortunate in that they rode the housing market down and really didn't do a lot to try to mitigate that, with standing to different segments. So as we did these businesses and quickly get them ramped up, with a broader product selection, better inventory control, better associated product sales, which Sherwin-Williams always has brought to all of these acquisitions, and a little bit of a better DIY present. So we would expect to start to see them rebound, closer to Sherwin-Williams' typical store margins. And I think Sean really articulated that well how we kind of get from where we are today to these integrations and to a positive return in 2015. And then from that platform begin to move them up to our traditional stores' operating margins. So thrilled to have these stores. The talent that came with them in terms of store management, sales reps, the folks that face customers are great. And we're excited to get them up and running.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Chris, will they be rebranded as Sherwin stores? Or will they remain Comex?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. Well first of all, they're not called Comex in United States. They operate under 5 different brand names that were the original names of these businesses. We may have been rolled up back in late 1990s. And Comex did nothing to really change that or integrate that. Our practice has been, Bob, over time, to carefully secure all the customer relationships and, at the appropriate time, rebrand these stores under Sherwin-Williams. That process can take anywhere from 3 to 5 years or longer, depending on the individual market and strength of the brand. And that same kind of thoughtful process that we use for Duron and MAB and some of the other recent acquisitions will be the case here as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Chris, I was wondering if you could speak to the expected growth in U.S. architectural gallon at the industry level for 2013.","Robert J. Wells","Kevin, this is Bob. As you know, an industry that is not well tracked and measured, there's a lot of estimates out there. The estimates by the American Coatings Association is that the industry, through the first half, went up mid-single digits, stronger in the second quarter than in the first, to actually upper single-digit in the second quarter. We have not seen any indication that market growth in the third quarter thus far. And the ACA typically lags the end of the quarter by a month or so. So -- and frankly, we're not very well versed on their methodology, so I don't know how they're gathering this data. But it feels to us like mid single-digits is probably not out of the realm of possibilities for the market.","Christopher M. Connor","And that was on top of 3.7% increase in 2012, which was pretty well-corroborated by the ability to look back, which you can tie a bunch of different sources. So to Bob's point, an accelerating market was a better industry gallon numbers this year than last year. Hence, more support for the earlier questions about why we're deciding to open more stores.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. I guess, speaking of acceleration. I want to come back to your store count. I guess you're 42 year-to-date, so 80 to 90 would imply something like 38 to 48 in 4Q, if my math is right there. So a couple of questions. Have you done that many in a quarter before? And as you look at integrating the U.S. portion of Comex, should we think of that number as a grosser net number, given any rationalization that you may need to do as integration progresses?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. So this staying on the 80 to 90 estimates for the core incremental growth, we absolutely, Kevin, despite our best efforts, haven't gotten to open that many stores in the quarter. This process always ends up being a back half-loaded exercise, despite how hard we push on various real estate developers to get these stores into us sooner. In fact, last year, in the fourth quarter, we opened 42 stores. So we'll have to get that done and to know how to do that and we expect to go forward on that. We haven't commented yet on the 306 Comex stores relative to what the likely closings would be there as a result of overlapping locations. I think, if you would look historically at past transactions we've made, somewhere in the 15% to 20% store count would be kind of at the high end of the closings that we would affect. That would put you, in this particular scenario, in a 40 to 60 store count. Don't forget, Kevin, that as we've shown various maps, these stores are actually falling into geographies where our penetration is slightly less than it had been in more of our denser markets. And so our expectation is that we probably won't see numbers that high, maybe 10% to 15% range will be a better -- we'll have to think about. And those announcements will come up out as leases expire and then we get a better chance to get our hands in the business. Again, as we commented, we'll give you a lot more color as we go through 2014 on this business.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt McGinley with ISI Group.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A year ago, when you introduced us to Comex, you had said that the business, when you purchased it, it was like maybe worth somewhere around $1 in earnings in the first year. And you indicated that there will be charges related to U.S. operations will be $0.60 to $0.65. Does that imply that the Mexico assets are worth about $1.60 in year 1? Or is this more of a fixer-upper than you had anticipated in that dollar earnings that you had talked about a year ago as off the table?","Sean P. Hennessy","Just to clarify one thing, what you said is if we could close that Comex field by the end of the first quarter, so once you given us 9 months to do a lot of integration work that we're just talking about now with the U.S. and Canada piece, we would start to look at the dollar in -- a year later. Number one, that's down a little deeper. We're able to close this on September 16. But your sense of -- it's not apples and oranges, it's a little -- it's closer than apples but it's not totally apples-to-apples. But Kevin said what you just said, you're absolutely right. All of the indication would be -- is that the Mexican asset would be able to -- is a very strong asset, producing nice operating margin.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And the U.S. assets were maybe not as good as you had anticipated when you first looked at the total operation, or the Mexican asset was as good as they were 1 year ago?","Sean P. Hennessy","No. Yes. Both of those things. I think, we're not that surprised of where we ended up in the U.S. and Canada assets. They're pretty much where we thought they would be. And the Mexican piece is doing fine. When -- we get asked every once in a while, \"Would you continue to whet your appetite?\" Our appetite is still there for that Mexican piece because that Mexican piece will create shareholder value.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Last quarter, you discussed some distortions related to weather that may be interior versus exterior mix shift. And in fact negative and positive [ph] did that reverse in the third quarter? And how much do you think that perhaps pent up demand helped the unit growth in the third quarter?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I think, we actually were mentioning that in the first quarter, because in the first quarter 2012, there was repainting going on in Chicago in February. And so there was really no winter as compared to a normal winter. So that first quarter was when we really mentioned it. And I would tell you that pent up, year-to-date, I think, it's evened itself out. But when you talk about that, I don't think it changed any of the pent up. In the third quarter, I think it had more to do with last year in the third quarter was our lowest comp store increase. But I don't see that as a factor.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John McNulty of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse group.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones. On the Consumer segment, the margins were noticeably higher, actually, than they've ever been for a third quarter. How much of it is tied to the strength in Paint Stores versus the lumpiness that you were talking about in terms of order patterns? And is this kind of a sustainable level now that the Paint Store Group is kind of as big as it is?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I would say that's 60-40. I think the lumpiness of the sales was 60% of that improvement. Store group was 40%. I think that if you look at the beginning of the quarter, we were managing our SG&A and so forth. Nothing [ph] is as strong as sales. But that strong improvement in sales, the consumer for the timing really helped the margins in the third quarter, but the Paint Stores group having that volume go through and it was nice. I would tell you, over the years, we've continually talked about this consumer group being more in the flattish long-term and we've said that the margins, and you've correctly pointed out, one of the strongest margins we've ever had, will be a little more choppy than stores. But there'll be times when these quarters, we will have quarters like this because of the volume going through and certain things hitting. The operating margins will be higher than stores. But over the long term, we think that it will be slightly higher because of where stores group in. But it won't be this high. In fact, every fourth quarter, that operating margin is depressed a little bit in that Consumer Group.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then, just so we understand what may come out in next week in terms of the decision from the commission, is that a -- that's the end of the game kind of decision and it's either a yes or a no? Or is there a further appeal process, or is your appeal already in and you can get some derivation of an answer, whether it's yes\/no, or yes, if you do the following? How should we think about what the decision actually could potentially be?","Robert J. Wells","That's a fair question, John, and I wish I had more certainty on how I answer this. This is a brand-new commission, and we are one of the first rulings that they're going to distribute. There's a possibility that their decision is in line with our proposal to them and we accept it and we're good to go. There may be things that don't agree with what we had prepared to do and they're asking for more. At which point, we would have the ability to discuss that further with them. So it's a little bit of a difficult answer for us to give until we actually get into the arena.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","If we look at that -- Sean, if we look at that $0.60 to $0.65 you suggested for the next 4 quarters for Comex U.S., Canada, I'd like to think about it in 3 pieces. One would be noncash-type charges related to, say, write-offs or impairment. And then, what's the underlying operating losses for the business? And then, thirdly, what the percentage of that amount would be, cash integration expenses?","Sean P. Hennessy","Chuck, over the next 12 months of doing the purchase accounting, we're having evaluations. And so we probably have a better answer for you maybe in 2 quarters. And the reason I say that is it really depends on how much value we put on certain assets that we eventually are going to eliminate. And so that would be, back to your point, the noncash charges. But we'll see what happens. I think, when you take a look at the cash and [indiscernible] our cash, and I would tell you when you think about $0.60 to $0.65, and I'll use $0.60 and 100 million shares, so you're talking $60 million, I would tell you that, cash wise, probably 80%, 85% of that $60 million will be cash depression that we get from -- that will occur over the next 15 months.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","And of that 85%, Sean, how would you break that down between the ongoing operating loss there or the startup operating loss, and then voluntary expenditures when Sherwin-Williams integrate the business?","Sean P. Hennessy","I would probably cut the 80% about 70-30, 30% cost of integration and closing cost, 70% from the operation. Then, I think, by that time, then the operations will be cash positive in 2015 -- 2016, very nicely, cash positive.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","All right. How should we think about capital expenditures for next year? I don't think there would be a lot to go with what you've already purchased from Comex. But if you can give us perhaps a scenario to consider if you do indeed get your wish and the deal with Mexico -- with Mexican assets goes forward?","Sean P. Hennessy","I think that if you look at the core, I think just when you think about increasing the number of stores, the CapEx will be up this year just in the core piece. I think that there are -- some of the -- majority of the stores that we just -- the 306, are long-term stores for us, long-term markets. And I think you're going to see us put some CapEx into those. I'll just sort of put this answer in that 3. So I think store CapEx is going to be up because of increased stores. Number 2, these stores, we are going to put some POS devices in the [indiscernible] stores, shaking equipment, I mean tinting equipment, color equipment that we have. And then, if we complete Comex, there'll be another step change there, Chuck, that if we do complete it, we'll give you that number.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","All right. And how should we think about share repurchases in light of how these deals shape up? Originally, you indicated you would abstain for most repo activity because of the size of the deal. Now it's taken place in cases and you have bought back some in the most recent quarter?","Sean P. Hennessy","I think that what really motivated us there to buy back stock is when you look at the cash generation, Chuck, if you look at our cash generation, and in Chris' comments, he talked about 10%. We've never been at 10% of sales through the third quarter in our history, and I think that's huge because, as you know, we're negative in the first quarter. It used to be if we could be slightly positive through the second quarter, we were over 4% year-to-date. And now we're over 10% for the first time in the third quarter. And I think we've consistently said that we're not going to hold cash. We feel that the cash generation from the acquisition will take care of itself. And we're going to buy back stock with that cash. We're not going to hold it.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","That's great. One last question. Just because I don't think anybody mentioned it, paint stores pricing in the third quarter, I'm going to take that that was flattish?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions. On Comex in the U.S., you talked about being more focused on the new residential construction. Will that be -- if that goes through next year, will that be a drag a little bit on your mix as you get new products in there that would be noticeable? And then, also, with the losses, is this going to help or how do you expect your tax rate to be impacted next year, assuming just the U.S. assets?","Sean P. Hennessy","Ivan, on the drag of Comex. I think that it's $500 million. It's not a small piece when you think about the Stores group. But in total, the gross margins and the operating margins won't be a drag on stores group. On the selling price, I don't think that -- as time goes on, it will be slightly. But I think that there's no doubt that the operating margin in the Stores group next year, because of that $0.60 to $0.65, will be a drag. On the tax rate, again, we think that if we do complete the Comex acquisition, that could give us an opportunity to have a step change in our tax rate. The U.S. piece is going to change -- is going to have that kind of a step change.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","I just wanted to understand a little bit on the Latin American piece. You've done over the 2 quarters as far as paying the Brazilian duty catch-up for 2 years. So in the fourth quarter, should we expect the margins in this business to sort of get back to whatever normal level is on a year-over-year basis, something in the mid to high single-digits? Or is it that we're going to see a sort of a drag in the business that goes beyond the Brazilian duties?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. So you're correct that the Brazilian import tax issue is behind us. So that will not be recurring or anything from that in the fourth quarter. We'll be back to the business' performance. I think what you'll see there, Dmitry, is the impact that we've been talking about for a while now on just the softening market conditions as well as the currency impact in the margins. Don't forget that Latin America, like all of the coatings businesses, buy their raw materials on a dollar-denominated basis. And so despite the fact that we can manufacture and sell in-country, we do have this impact of a global dollar denominator raw material, and we shared with you in the past the sizable amount of cost facility with our raw material basket. So we're probably going to see Latin American margins running lower than their normal run rate, even after this tax issue, and that will rebound as pricing activities take place, raw materials moderate and the dollar versus local currencies gets back online.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just I know the question was asked about this already, but I couldn't follow the answer, so maybe I'll ask it again. The seasonal shipments that you mentioned in the Consumer business, I think, you said they took place in September, which improved the growth in that division in the third quarter. Was that sort of pulled forward from the fourth quarter? How should we think about the Consumer business performance in the fourth quarter, understanding that it's going up against somewhat tougher comp as well?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. So unlike our stores business, where every single days sales are reported based on the gallons that go out the door, consumers selling into supply chain of our customers, and so whatever their inventory needs are, stocking issues are, can impact a quarter like this. And we've commented on this in years past. There were just a couple of our customers that placed significantly stronger orders on the business in September than we had forecasted for. And their businesses are doing well and maybe we won't see a fall from that, but our guidance for the fourth quarter would be that the consumer segment will post the same kind of numbers that we've been seeing throughout the year and that we expect them to be negative for the year in the low single-digit range.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. That's helpful. Then finally, and that leads me to my next question. From what you're seeing your store growth at least, because you get out a little bit sooner, with the feedback loop, how is the October looking as far as [indiscernible], 5-year day [ph], the weather up until recently has been rather warm, so I would expect the [indiscernible] to extend a little bit. Are you benefiting from that in the month of October from what you can see?","Christopher M. Connor","Dmitry, I had 4 inches of snow in my house yesterday, so I'm not sure I'm buying the extension of this beautiful Indian summer across America. I think we've been pretty consistent over the years in not commenting or blaming weather either for goodness or difficult times. We're going to have pockets of good and bad weather in every quarter across the country. I think this will be a very typical fourth quarter for the industry in terms of kind of demand cycle. And certainly, there are those jobs that you pointed out that we're seeing next year work still being wrapped up, but those are coming to an end quickly and it should be a pretty stable mix environment, as it would've been historically.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. And the last question on the store openings as opposed to Comex. You're accelerating your fourth quarter store openings, as you've done in the last year or 2. But you're going to be adding over 300 stores in Comex, it sounds like you're going to have your hands full in getting those stores' product life and customers over the line with the market. How should we think about your store openings sort of in 2014 and maybe 2015 before the Comex integration is completed?","Christopher M. Connor","We'll have a lot more clarity on that in January call, Dmitry. But what I would comment is that we have consistently said for quite some time now that we see 5,000 stores as a reasonable expectation in North America. And we have an infrastructure in place that knows how to get these stores sourced, discovered, built, opened and running. I don't think you'll see us fall off that 80 to 90 base at all going toward next year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","First question. Just with the revenue trend, I guess, in the third quarter organically, we get to about a 9% growth number and you're guiding to 5% to 7% in the fourth. Obviously, there's a lot of stuff that goes into that timing-wise and year ago comps. As you guys plan for fourth quarter, are you thinking on a seasonally adjusted basis that demand is stable, up or down relative to the third quarter?","Christopher M. Connor","I think it's stable. I think that we feel very good about the stableness of 3 segments. The one piece that I think that Chris did mention in our guidance is we do not have the fourth quarter repeating and over 5% sales gain in the Consumer group.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then for the Comex stores domestically, can you just compare and contrast the physical either location of the stores or size of the stores relative to a typical Sherwin store? Is the capacity of those stores on the revenue side similar or different?","Christopher M. Connor","Very similar, Dennis. They would be a typical 4,000 to 5,000 square foot box, which is right in line with ours. I think every single one of these 300 stores is leased, Sean, if I'm not mistaken?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes.","Christopher M. Connor","So they're all leasehold locations. They would be in fairly similar traffic pattern locations, standalone facilities in small strip centers. I would say there's a good number of these that are in locations that we have coveted to be and we're actually pleased to get a number of outstanding paint stores in new neighborhoods that we currently -- in that locations. And nothing about the physical locations or box size of these stores will limit our ability to run them at the same kind of average store sales or productivity that we get out of our current format.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Margin in the quarter excluding the Brazilian import duties, it looks like the overall gross margin was 46, which is the upper end of that range that you historically have talked about or recently talked about getting to. Curious on how you think about where gross margins go from here also in regards to pricing and mix? And again, obviously, without Comex, where you think the gross margin path might go over the next 6 or 12 months for the company?","Robert J. Wells","We feel pretty good about the quarter, Eric. We actually grow 46 1 without -- well, we computed but when you look at it, for the full year, we're in that mid 40, 45. Last quarter, we talked about that we think the full year was going to be right in between that 45 year-to-date that we were at the end of the second quarter and the high end of 46. We feel good about this, that we're in that same answer. A couple of things. Number one, LIFO last year was a big nice improvement. We were 43 9 going into that fourth quarter, we're now at 44 8. We're not going to have a 9\/10 improvement between year-to-date and the fourth quarter this year. And it's because that LIFO credit that we brought back in the fourth quarter, the way raws came in. You're right that Comex will depress our gross margin a little bit, but I think that we still feel good about where our gross margin is. I think that the volatility in raw materials seems to be a little calmer as with the business. Markets that Chris mentioned, a little more confident in the market and the volumes tremendously more stable than they were in '09 and '10. I think that our gross margin stays in the range we're in right now, depressed a little bit by the Comex, but improved because of the volumes that we're putting through subgroup.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Nils Wallin of CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Just on Comex, bringing the negative margin in that business to positive and to actually accretive in the U.S. stores, what needs to happen from rationalization, from a new product and then just from normal market growth? What -- those 3 buckets, what needs to happen in order to get to your goal?","Christopher M. Connor","I think, a good way to about this, Nils, is no different than Sherwin opening a new store in kind of the ramp from dilutive impact up to contributing and eventually, when you're 3 or 4 running kind of on a comp store profitability level. So what needs to happen here is mostly productivity. We need more volume, more gallons going through those boxes than they've been enjoying. I think Sean has done a nice job of taking you through the cost impact that were diluted. As we rationalized, we comment on maybe 10% to 15% store count needs to come out. There'll be some SG&A adds to strengthen the stores staffing in these facilities. But it's pretty much the same kind of blocking impact that we do each and every day in these districts to service these customers that we know how to do, and we expect we can get these volumes up to the level where they'll be performing. And I think, Sean made the comment, accretive by 2015. And by 2016, really accretive. So therein lies the path forward.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Got it. And just because of the timing differences between the Comex U.S. -- Canada and Comex Mexico, assuming that the commission has a favorable decision, is there anything that changes, besides obviously just the timing, is there anything that changes the pace of integration? Do they -- are they dependent at all on one another?","Christopher M. Connor","No, 2 entirely different businesses, run separately by Comex, for that matter. So our integration teams are entirely different. We moved forward on this U.S. and Canadian teams because it entirely resides inside our Paint Store Group. And that team was ready, chomping at the bit and wanting to go. And then, of course, the Mexican piece will be embedded in our Latin American Coatings Group. An equally talented team down there prepared to get engaged when that one comes. No issues at all bifurcating these transactions from an integration standpoint.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Great. And then, just finally, the same-store sales growth, is there -- were you taking any share? Because it certainly was a dramatic year-on-year improvement.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I think, we have to assume we were. We've seen the release of some of our public competitors. Bob commented earlier on the call, this is the kind of market environment where we think gallons are growing in that mid single-digit range and our gallons were double-digit. So we're feeling good about the share position of the company right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts of UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Did you say how fast you could close Comex deal if you get a favorable ruling next week?","Robert J. Wells","Yes. We didn't say it. But I think, Chris used the word prompt. And it really depends on if we get next week, I mean, we'd like to do it October 1 -- or I'm sorry, November 1.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, October 1 would be great. Secondly, if you get surprised by the lead paint ruling, is the appeal process any different for a bench case versus what you paid in Rhode Island that was a jury case?","Christopher M. Connor","No, John. To our knowledge, it's the same. And it's likely a multiyear process.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just thirdly, above average growth that you're seeing relative to the market, do you think that's just professionally applied paint versus DIY? I would think there's more recovery comment in the professional painter market than DIY just because DIY doesn't cycle as much?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think you're right on that. We certainly are benefiting from the rebound in the professional painting contractor. That will be a portion of the share gain. I do think that some of these gallons are coming from our competitors as well.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Noon - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","This is Chris Noon stepping in for Don. Most of my questions have been answered. But I guess, you guys have given some color on U.S. architectural volume growth year-to-date and I was wondering if you could just give us a little more color on why you've been outpacing it in the year and why you feel confident that you'll be able to continue outpacing the market?","Robert J. Wells","Well, yes, Chris, I think it is a combination of factors that have led to our Paint Stores Group outpacing market growth. I mean, number one, we were among -- we were in very rare company opening stores during this downturn, and as a result, we're emerging into the recovery with a much higher store count and with mature stores in markets where we didn't have them prior to the downturn. Secondly, as was indicated earlier by John, just in the previous question, the painting contractor market appears to be growing faster than the DIY market, and that is where the majority of our exposure is in Paint Stores Group. We introduced a lot of new product lines during this downturn that are getting traction. So there's a whole -- and we've made significant investments in SG&A in store service level, which certainly helps attract new customers and more business from current customers in the recovery. So it's a broad combination of factors.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates.","Richard O'Reilly","I was also going to ask about the weather because in New Jersey, it's been beautiful here, but I think you've already answered that. But on the same-store, it was up 10.9%, 1 year ago, it was up 8.9%, so that's an average of about 10%. Do you think that's a real number or is that the year-to-date, the 7.4% of data [ph] number that we should be looking at?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, I think, the 7.4% is the better number. I mean, there's 9 months of activity there. If the market's growing in the mid single-digit range and we're running at 7.5% on revenue and volume is a little bit higher, that's a pretty strong performance. I think that's more kind of typical. We have had periods of time in rebounding markets where we posted multiple quarters in a row of double-digit comp store sales gains, but we've never been one to give that kind of robust guidance. And so I think, the 7.4% feels about right.","Operator","At this time, we've come to the end of our question-and-answer session for today. I'll now turn the floor back over to Bob Wells for closing comments.","Robert J. Wells","Thanks, Rob. We appreciate all of you joining us on the call this morning.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.","A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the Company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the Company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions.","I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Jessie. Good morning, everyone. In the interest of time, we\u2019ve provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information, including a slide deck with a breakdown of our results by the new reportable segments, on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, April 24 press release.","Consolidated sales in the first quarter 2018, increased $1.2 billion, or 43.6%, to $3.97 billion. Excluding Valspar results, core consolidated sales increased 4.9% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars in the first quarter increased $343.8 million, or 25.6%, to $1.69 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the first quarter was 42.5% compared to reported first quarter 48.6% in the same period last year.","Selling, general and administrative expense increased $203.5 million, or 20.1%, to $1.21 billion in the first quarter but decreased as a percent of sales to 30.6% from 36.6% in the same quarter last year. The decreases in both gross margin and SG&A as a percent of sales is primarily the result of a mix effect from the inclusion of Valspar.","Interest expense for the quarter increased $65.9 million to $91.5 million. The increase was entirely due to acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before tax in the first quarter decreased $3 million, or 98 basis points, to $303.6 million. These results include a year-over-year increase in acquisition and integration costs of approximately $106.8 million.","Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 17.6%. We expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2018 to be in the low to mid-20s.","Diluted net income per common share increased to 3.6% to $2.62 per share from $2.53 last year. The $2.62 includes $0.95 per share in acquisition-related expenses including purchase accounting amortization; and income of $0.68 per share, net of incremental interest expense from Valspar operations.","We have summarized the first quarter earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our first quarter 2018 press release. Let me take a few minutes to break down our performance by segment.","Sales for The Americas Group in the first quarter increased $128.7 million, or 6.6%, to $2.08 billion. Comparable store sales for in the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.2% in the quarter.","Regionally, in the first quarter, our Canada division led all divisions, followed by Southwest division, Southeast division, Midwestern division and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. First quarter sales in Latin America region, stated in U. S. dollars, increased 9.5%. Currency translation reduced net sales in U.S. dollars by 2.8% in the quarter.","First quarter segment profit increased $32.2 million, or 10.5%, to $337.4 million. First quarter segment operating margin increased 60 basis points to 16.2% from 15.6% last year.","Turning, now to the Consumer Brands Group. First quarter external net sales increased $333 million, or 103%, to $656.4 million. Revenue reclassification related to the newly adopted ASC 606 reduced net sales by 2.1%. Excluding sales from Valspar, core sales for the group decreased 5.3% in the quarter including a 1.6% positive impact from currency translation.","Segment profit for the Consumer Brands Group in the first quarter increased $18.3 million, or 32.8%, to $74.2 million. Segment profit for the quarter includes a $31.8 million charge for purchase accounting amortization. Excluding Valspar, core segment profit for the group decreased 11.8% in the quarter.","Segment profit as a percent of net sales for the quarter decreased to 11.3% from 17.3% last year. Excluding Valspar, core operating margin for the group decreased 118 basis points in the quarter to 16.1%.","For our Performance Coatings Group, first quarter net sales in U.S. dollars increased $743.3 million, or 153.4%, to $1.23 billion. Excluding sales from Valspar, core sales for the group increased 5.3% in the quarter.","Stated in U.S. dollars, Performance Coatings Group segment profit in the first quarter increased $33.7 million, or 58.9%, to $90.8 million from $57.1 last year. Segment profit for the quarter includes a $57.5 million charge for purchase accounting amortization. Excluding Valspar, core segment profit decreased 12.1% in the quarter.","Currency, translation rate changes increased segment profit $4.6 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment profit decreased to 7.4% in the first quarter compared to 11.8% last year including the purchase accounting amortization expense. Excluding Valspar, core operating margin for the group decreased 195 basis points in the quarter.","I\u2019ll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our Lead Pigment Litigation. In our Santa Clara County California lawsuit, the Sixth District Court of Appeals remanded the case back to the trial court. A new trial court judge has been assigned to the case, as the judge who presided over the trial retired.","The trial court has two issues to resolve: first, calculation of liability based on the pre-1951 housing standard; and second, selection of a receiver. The new judge will determine the process for deciding these two issues. An initial hearing took place March 28, and initial briefs on the proposed size of the abatement fund were filed last week. The next hearing is scheduled for May 24. The defendants plan to seek certification in the U. S. Supreme Court. Petitions are likely to be filed in June or July. That concludes our review of our operating results for the first quarter.","So let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the remainder of 2018. John?","John Morikis","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Despite a slow start to the painting season in certain regions of North America, we delivered strong results in our first quarter. Sales, gross profit, net income and diluted earnings per share were all first quarter records for the company. We are seeing continued strong demand across most businesses, and we're making good progress on the Valspar integration, value capture and pricing initiatives to offset raw material inflation.","If you back out the contribution from Valspar, our core consolidated sales grew by nearly 5% compared to first quarter 2017, with a little more than half coming from volume, consolidated gross profit dollars increased by nearly $40 million in the quarter. The core gross margin declined 93 basis points year-over-year to 47.8%. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 121 basis points, and core consolidated profit before tax increased 7.2% and expanded 25 basis points as a percent of sales.","Core diluted earnings per share, again, excluding Valspar results and acquisition costs, increased 10.7% to $2.89 compared to the same quarter last year. The Valspar business had a little more than $1 billion in net sales and $0.68 to earnings per share in the quarter. Consolidated first quarter 2018 EPS, excluding acquisition expenses, increased 36.8% year-over-year to $3.57 per share. The Americas Group grew volumes and improved their operating performance compared to the first quarter last year, although growth was at the lower end of our expectations due to slow exterior paint sales in some regions for most of the quarter.","Sales to residential repaint contractors in the U.S. and Canada grew at a double-digit pace for the 16th time in the last 18 quarters. Protective and marine coatings sales in the U.S. and Canada grew in the high single digits. And property management, new residential, commercial and DIY segments all contributed to TAG's growth in the quarter. Latin America sales in total increased 9.5%. It appears that the fundamental demand and trends remain strong across the business.","TAG segment operating margins improved 60 basis points compared to the first quarter last year, reflecting our progress in implementing price increases to offset a challenging raw material cost environment and good expense control as SG&A decreased slightly as a percent of sales. The group opened seven net new stores in the quarter, bringing our total store count at the end of the quarter to 4,624 stores in the Americas. Our plan calls for this team to add approximately 100 net new stores in The Americas by the end of the year. The e-commerce platform launched by TAG last year is receiving positive reviews from both our customers and our field organization. And we expect adoption to increase over time, enhancing both our in-store and field service experience.","Consumer Brands Group also showed good progress in the first quarter, but the improvement is not quite as obvious in the numbers. On a year-over-year basis compared to pro forma combined results from first quarter 2017, sales increased 3.8% and adjusted operating margin, excluding the purchase accounting impacts, improved by 260 basis points. If you look at it sequentially, first quarter sales increased nearly 15% compared to fourth quarter 2017, much of which is probably attributable to seasonality.","And first quarter reported operating margins expanded 720 basis points to 11.3% compared to 4.1% in fourth quarter. Backing out purchase accounting amortization expenses from both quarters, segment operating margin in the first quarter was 16.2% compared to approximately 9.9% in the fourth quarter. The improvement in segment operating margin, both sequentially and year-over-year, is a result of successful expense control and cost synergies as well as our early progress in implementing price increases.","On February 28, Lowe's announced a significantly expanded partnership with Sherwin-Williams, in which Lowe's will become the only nationwide home center to offer our top-selling wood care brands, including Minwax, Cabot, Thompson's WaterSeal, the top paintbrush brand in Purdy and industry-leading spray-paint in Krylon. Lowe's continues to be the only nationwide home center to offer our Valspar and HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams brands of interior and exterior paints.","Both companies are supporting this effort with incremental investment in service, training and brand communications. And we're confident this combination of high quality products, category-leading brands and outstanding customer service will accelerate comp growth in Lowe's paint aisle. Lowe's will determine the timing and cadence of the department resets. While there is no impact from this announcement in first quarter 2018, we do expect this expanded partnership to result in increased volumes and revenues in full year 2018.","Given our anticipated investment in marketing, displays, training and other support areas, we expect earnings dilution of approximately $0.40 this year. In the Performance Coatings Group, top line growth was just under 10% compared to pro forma combined revenues in the first quarter 2017. Sales were up in every product category, led by packaging coatings, general industrial and Industrial Wood Coatings. Reported segment operating margin was 7.4% compared to 11.8% reported last year.","If you back out the impact of purchase accounting amortization in the quarter, which was a little over $57 million, adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 12.1%, which compares to 13.5% pro forma combined operating margin last year. The pressure on operating margins year-over-year as a result of continued escalation in raw material costs, most notably, petrochemicals and epoxy, which are a large portion of the Performance Coatings raw material basket. We continue to work with our customers to recover these cost increases through pricing actions.","EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increased 44% to $557.8 million in the first quarter, which includes $137.9 million from Valspar. EBITDA margin was flat year-over-year at 13.9% of sales. Core EBITDA without Valspar increased 6% to $413.9 million. Net operating cash in the quarter was $40.7 million compared to $231.8 million a year ago. Net operating cash in the first quarter last year included a benefit of approximately $137 million from settlements of the Treasury lock hedge. Changes in working capital come from most of the remainder of the difference.","On March 31, the company had $158.6 million of cash on hand that will be utilized to reduce debt and fund operations. During the quarter, we raised our dividend to $0.86 per share, paying $81 million in cash dividends. The balance sheet reflects preliminary purchase accounting balances and total debt of approximately $10.8 billion. We intend to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to approximately 3:1 by the end of 2018.","Our capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $42.3 million. Depreciation was $71.6 million, and amortization of intangibles and inventory step-up was $85 million. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $330 million, which is about 1.9% of anticipated sales, as we continue to invest in productivity improvements, systems and new stores.","Depreciation should be between $280 million to $290 million, and amortization will be about $340 million. On our year-end 2017 call, we said we would resume opportunistic open-market purchases of company stock in 2018 at a level sufficient to offset dilution from options exercises. In the first quarter, we purchased 600,000 shares at an average price of $401.91 per share.","On March 31, we","{***10-20***}","{***Spart-020***}","On March 31, we had remaining authorization to acquire approximately 11 million shares. It's hard to believe that June 1 will mark one year since the close of the Valspar acquisition. I'm extremely proud of the progress we have made in the 10 months we've been together. Perhaps, most proud of the fact that we are increasingly functioning as a single unified global team.","You should take comfort in the fact that as a team, we remain focused on execution and value capture in the areas of SG&A, raw materials, manufacturing, distribution, R&D and revenues. We have confidence in our 2018 year-end annual run rate synergy target of $320 million, which should benefit this year's P&L by about $140 million to $160 million. We expect to book most of the remaining costs to achieve these synergies in 2018, and we are increasingly confident in our long-term annual run rate range of $385 million to $415 million.","Turning to our outlook for the balance of the year. With strong sales and volume momentum coming out of the first quarter, we anticipate second quarter consolidated core net sales will increase a mid-to-high single-digit percentage compared to the second quarter of 2017.","In addition, we expect incremental sales from Valspar to be approximately $600 million, for the months of April and May, where June 1, making the one year anniversary of the close of the transaction. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect, core net sales will increase a mid-to-high single-digit percentage compared to full year 2017. ","In addition, we expect incremental sales from Valspar in the first five months of 2018 to add approximately $1.7 billion to consolidated revenues. With these factors in mind, we anticipate diluted net income per common share for 2018 will be in the range of $14.95 to $15.45 per share. This guidance has been revised to include approximately $0.40 per share dilution from our initial investment in the Lowe's partnership, which reduces the anticipated income contribution from Valspar to $2.30 to $2.50 per share. ","Acquisition-related costs and purchase accounting impacts are expected to be $3.40 to $3.50 per share. Given the many moving parts in last year's results and this year's guidance, it can be challenging to understand our underlying earnings per share performance. We believe the most meaningful way to view guidance is to exclude Valspar acquisition costs and one-time items, which results in a full year EPS guidance midpoint of $18.65 compared to $15.07 adjusted EPS last year.","On this basis, earnings per share would grow by nearly 24% year-over-year at the mid-point of our 2018 guidance. We have included Regulation G reconciliation table with this morning's press release to better illustrate all the moving parts. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan","Good morning, thanks guys. I guess just a couple of questions. So first off, just wanted to understand the 5.2% same-store sales performance. I know that you guys increased the prices by 3% to 5% in October, so maybe you can just update us on the traction there. And then similarly, if you are in kind of a low single-digit increase on prices, that would imply kind of a similar rate for volume. How do you see the volume kind of progressing through the year? I mean, I know that Q1 is \u2013 sorry the paint season is off to a slow start here. But are you optimistic that things could improve with weather getting better and labor availability maybe loosening up? Or how do you see that playing out? Thanks.","John Morikis","Sure. Let me start with the volume piece, and I'll have Al talk to the pricing. You're exactly right. We're feeling terrific about the volume and the momentum that we have in our stores organization. Had a number of opportunities to talk with not only our customers but our employees, and there's an overall feeling of confidence in the year, many, many customers talking about this being a record year for them. And I'd say the confidence is very strong. ","So you're right, we got off to a little slower start in a smaller quarter. Not too concerned with that. Feeling good about the key drivers that we've been talking about for quite some time, the continued focus on new accounts and share of wallet of existing customers. So the team is executing extremely well. We have great confidence this is going to be a terrific year for our stores.","Al Mistysyn","Hi, Arun this Al. When we talk about pricing in our Paint Stores Group, we realized a little more than 2% effective pricing. That was roughly sufficient to offset the raw material increases that we're seeing, and it's in line with the effectiveness that we were expecting in the quarter.","John Morikis","One other thing I'd add to that, Arun, we also look at some of the purchases of our customers to give us even more confidence. If you look at spray equipment purchases, for example, those were up double digits. The whole basket, if you look at those things that we look at internally to try to get a sense of how confident our customers are, they're all pointing terrifically in the right direction. ","Arun Viswanathan","And just a quick follow-up as I can on the other two segments, margins appear to be improving. And I was pleased to see the consumer performance. So I don't know if you can just characterize the price cost situation you're seeing in those two segments. Are they also improving? Thanks.","John Morikis","Yes. Why don't I take the same approach here? I'll talk about just the market here for just a moment, and then I'll have Al talk about the pricing. But you're exactly right. If you look at consumer, for example, and the way that we're running this business and the way that we look at the results, it's a combined business. The combined business for consumer was up 3.8%. And when I say it's combined, it's really one integrated organization now. We don't run separate businesses between the consumer, architectural and legacy SHW. There's one leadership team. There's one marketing team, one sales organization. ","And quite frankly, they're the furthest along in the integration. So they're working hard trying to be as responsive as they can to our customers' needs without regard to what brand they're selling. And when you look at the performance that they're posting, we feel pretty good about their position and the momentum that they have.","Al Mistysyn","I think on the on the price side, the we are seeing the positive effect of pricing initiative on Consumer Brands. Certainly, a work in process, and we have room to grow there. On the performance coatings side, as Bob or John talked about in the call, they did see the biggest impact on the increased raw material in the quarter. We had talked about our first half of the year having a tougher comparison from a raw material standpoint. And I would say that group is probably the furthest behind with the highest inflation and, again, making progress. And we'll continue to do so as we roll the quarters out.","John Morikis","Yes. Let me just give you a couple of comments on performance coatings from a market side of it. If you look at the momentum that they have, Arun, if you look at just going back to Q3, their sales were up 5.8%; Q4, up 6.9%; and then this most recent quarter, up 9.8%. And they're showing improvement year-over-year in their operating profit. ","So the profit, if you look at a pro forma basis for that same Q3 period, was down 15.9%; Q4, down 8.7%; in this most recent quarter, down 1.5%. None of us were happy with down 1.5% but it does illustrate the momentum that we're gaining here while growing our sales. And this is a team that's very determined in what they're doing, and we've got great confidence that they're going to continue to gain traction here. ","Arun Viswanathan","Great thank.","John Morikis","Thanks Arun.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. If I can just follow-up on performance coatings numbers. It looks like sequentially, your revenues were up a little bit, and your operating profit was down, I don't know, $15 million. So it looks like what's happening is that your raw material squeeze is getting a little bit larger or your raw materials are rising faster than your pricing efforts. Is that true? And how do you expect that progression to go in the second quarter? ","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Jeff you are absolutely correct. We did see an acceleration of raw material cost increases in our first quarter, and it predominantly impacted our Performance Coatings Group. And as you can imagine, when they go up that quick, it's very hard for us to react and put another price increase into the market. That being said, we do have pricing implemented, and we'll monitor that situation as we always do on a month by-month basis. And if we see another increase that warrants a price adjustment, we'll do that. So pricing actions are in progress. ","John Morikis","I'll describe it as they are rowing in, there are continued pricing activities that continue but there are a number of agreements that have already been established that we are waiting for the timing to click in as well. So its a combination of those price agreements that we\u2019ve already hit on as well as those that are continuing to be implemented.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, for my follow-up, in Consumer Brands, you've picked up some business at Lowe's, and I guess, you've lost some business at Depot. Like, on an annualized basis, is the sales benefit something on the order of $200 million on a four quarter basis? And I guess, I'll leave it at that.","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Jeff. So if you look at 2019, you would expect it to be around that amount, maybe slightly below, but around that amount is a good start. ","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay great, thank you so much.","John Morikis","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with our question.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you. Just very quickly within The Americas Group. Can you comment on the actual end market trends across luxury paint, commercial and property management. Just getting away from some of the 1Q noise, just what are your intermediates to long-term thoughts? And then also a quick comment on Latin America would be very helpful. Thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Yes Chris. John walked through the current quarter's performance by segment. We had another double-digit performance from \u2013 in the residential repaint segment, high single-digit in Protective & Marine and mid-single-digit in most of the balance. I will tell you, the outlook for new residential looks pretty positive. Most \u2013 among most public builders, orders, new orders and backlogs are up in the low teens. We've seen a continued significant home value appreciation that should drive strong remodeling activity.","Harvard's LIRA forecasts 7-plus percent growth in remodeling activity through the year. The nonresidential square footage started the year pretty soft, but we expect commercial starts to grow this year probably in the range of about 4%, 5%. That translates to probably an equivalent level of growth in square footage. So new commercial looks strong. Residential repaint will continue to drive outsized growth in that segment because we're seeing probably a shift from DIY to do-it-for and a lot of investment amongst stay-in-place homeowners in upgrading their homes.","John Morikis","And Chris on Latin America, I'll take that. As a reminder, Latin America represents about 3.9% of our sales. From a sales and volume perspective, all countries were positive both in volume and sales. Pricing continues to improve with more pricing rolling in. So same activities there that we just talked about. We've achieved some pricing, but we're working hard to drive additional pricing as well as other margin initiatives internally that we can pursue.","Additionally, we're focused on pursuing more profitable segments and price points and customers, as you would expect, while continuing to look for additional synergy opportunities. So we didn't expect to go from a standing start here to a full sprint. This is kind of the path that we expected to see as we saw improvements in Latin America. So I'd say, it's progressing not fast enough for us. We want to move faster, and we're continuing to work with our teams to gain traction at a faster rate.","Christopher Parkinson","That is helpful. And just you did hit a little on this, but just to dig, I guess, one step deeper. Can you just talk about the end market performance in Performance Coatings, specifically those assets acquired from Val? And also I recently saw some price increases in packaging, but kind of what else can you do throughout 2018 to look at the setup for 2019 a little more favorably? So just any insights there would be very helpful.","John Morikis","Sure there are, to begin with there are some incredible sale synergies that our teams are working on. We're very excited about not only the pipeline or funnel, if you will, of existing identified sale synergies, but we're adding to those projects and programs every day. And so the more we work at identifying sales synergies, I'd tell you that the more we're finding the teams are energized and accelerating that. ","So I think, first and foremost, the combined businesses are going to be much stronger and more meaningful, we believe, in the marketplace. And our continued efforts there will be to identify more. Now that said, there's a lot of work that we can do to continue to improve our performance back. And by segment, each of those business units have identified those levers where we can pull and drive results. But I'd say, when you look at the Valspar business and the transaction, we've always said we had high expectations in our ability to achieve the value capture. We knew we could get the costs out, and we're working aggressively to that. ","And more confidence now than ever that we're going to be able to achieve that. But I'd also say that we have more confidence than ever in the sales synergies that are out there. And so our teams are working to identify those segments, those customers and how to better leverage the combined assets to drive the complementary nature of this business.","Al Mistysyn","And on the pricing side, we have talked consistently about specifically on Valspar Performance Coatings side that we're one price increase behind. So we're going to chase that throughout 2018. That being said, as John mentioned, prices rolling in, and we expect that to continue throughout the year.","Christopher Parkinson","That is very helpful thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Byrne","John you mentioned a few of these commercial expense line items that you're accelerating as part of that agreement with Lowe's, the sales expense, the marketing and displays and so forth. Are these onetime upfront line items that will dissipate over time? Or is it a matter of the expenses are recurring and the sales is going to lag before that shelf space in Lowe's is filled up with your product?","John Morikis","Let me take a piece of that, Steve, and then I'm going to have to turn it over to Al. I will say this that our expectations here are to help drive Lowe's business. And so to answer it, it's a little bit of both. There are certainly some expenses that we're investing in. So we're adding additional people, for example, to be a little closer to the sales associates, to ensure better execution on the sales floor, right? So doing more of what we've done and wanting to drive better results requires a little different behavior. We think helping to have the sales associates become more familiar and comfortable with a simplified product lineup and technology, helping them to sell better in the aisle, all those things, we think, are better off with the additional investments that we're making. ","When you look at the earnings release that we've posted, where this $0.40 hits in here and hits our EPS, part of that comes from the fact that, to your point, some of it hits in the third and fourth quarter, with very little sales recognition hitting this year. Let me just ask Al to touch on that a little bit.","Al Mistysyn","Yes. It is really just a timing issue. As you roll the program out, we're basically missing the summer selling season on the paint side. But you're having the costs of those roll in and, as John mentioned, primarily in our third and fourth quarter. That being said, we're excited about the program. And 2019 certainly will be accretive to sales, as we've talked before, but ain't profit.","Steve Byrne","Okay, thank you that is helpful. I wondering if you have made any changes yet in the China paint model of that wall room brand, the legacy Valspar brand. Have you made any changes in that overall model to accelerate sales?","John Morikis","Not so much in the model, Steve, but we are in other areas. We feel as though we've got quite a bit to bring to that business in technology and the approach to growing our business that we're transferring there.","Steve Byrne","Okay, thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks Steve.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with you question.","Don Carson","Yes, thank you. Going back to Paint Stores Group. You have 5.2% same-store sales growth. You're talking about Q2 and full year 2018 core sales up in the mid-to-high single high digits. So I assume Paint Store Group would be at the high end of that. What will be the price volume breakout there? Is price going to continue to add about twp points? Or given some of the increase we continue to see in TiO2 and with rising oil prices, you need another price increase in Paint Stores Group to maintain gross margins? ","Al Mistysyn","Yes Don, I think you are right. Price would be around that 2%. And as you recall, we went out on October 1, as we continue to roll that in, we might see a little bit more going in our second quarter. So the difference is volume, and you're absolutely correct, we do expect our stores, U. S. and Canada stores, to be in the high end of the mid-high single digits for our second quarter and for our full year. ","As far as price goes, we have a long-standing tradition that we'll continue to monitor the raw material basket. We'll push back on our vendors. We'll try to internalize from cost reductions as much as we can. And then absent those levers, we'll talk to our customers first and then talk to The Street about it any other increases.","Don Carson","As a follow-up on the raw material can you differentiate between what you are seeing on the architectural side versus the industrial side, particularly with epoxies on the latter? What's sort of the difference in your outlook for raw material increase between those two different end markets?","Al Mistysyn","Yes Don, on the architectural side, the primary driver is still TiO2. And we're seeing a somewhat similar trajectory in TiO2 to what we saw in 2017. All the global producers, as we expected, have announced second quarter price increases that are currently under negotiation. But that's really primarily what is driving inflation in the architectural side. On the industrial side of the raw material basket, you've got crude oil, propylene, which also affects architectural coatings, but it affects the industrial piece. Epoxies, zinc, all heading in the wrong direction. ","So we're seeing inflation from more of the raw material components on the industrial side. There's certainly inflation in the basket on both sides, probably more on industrial. ","Don Carson","Thanks Al.","Al Mistysyn","You bet.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hi, guys good morning. Just to sort of back up. Given that you stopped giving quarterly EPS guidance, did first quarter, from an earnings standpoint, play out the way you thought it would relative to your initial expectations? I know there are several moving parts such as weather, et cetera, that weighed on the quarter. But did the timeline of synergies come in ahead of your initial view? And how much do you think the unfavorable weather in the U.S. impacted the quarter the best you can tell?","John Morikis","So I would say the quarter did come in a little bit better than what we're planning. We did have a lower tax rate in the quarter due to some discretes \u2013 the timing of some of the discrete items. But you look at the strength in our Consumer Brands and our Performance Coatings businesses, both outperformed even what our expectations were. So that's really why the quarter came in better. As far as weather is concerned, it's hard to pinpoint an exact amount on what the impact is in the quarter.","Ghansham Panjabi","And just sort of a follow-up. Just given, perhaps, the weather disruption this quarter as well, at least the beginning of the quarter, how do you feel about your customers catching up to their backlogs as the year progresses in context of trades generally being tight from a labor standpoint previously?","John Morikis","Yes, we have had a lot of discussion about that, Ghansham. And overall, I'd say, at this point, we still feel pretty good about the contractors' ability to maintain what they are calling or what they're projected to be a record year. We're working hard to help them with that. We\u2019ve talked a lot about the products have been developed to help their productivity and the services that we provide in our stores to be able to help them be responsive. ","So it's going to be a push as we have a lot of people working hard on weekends and long hours. But right now, I'd say we're still confident in our ability to turn this into an outstanding year","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay, terrific, thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks Ghansham.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you and good morning everyone. As I think about the manufacturing synergies associated with Valspar, I was pretty focused on your ability to consolidate their facilities. But now with this incremental volume going into Lowe's, how does that change the calculus there? Is having more volume better than shutting down more facilities? Or What if anything has changed?","John Morikis","Absolutely having more volume better than shutting down facilities. But I think the teams is still on pace to rationalize the four facilities that they had talked about late last year, and that'll roll in, in our third and fourth quarters. And I think that team does a great job of finding capacity within the four walls that allows us to take on incremental business without adding significant assets or requiring us to keep the fixed assets.","Vincent Andrews","And just a follow-up. The 600,000 shares repurchased in the first quarter, is there a reason why it was so large in the first quarter? And how should we be thinking about repurchases for the balance of the year?","Al Mistysyn","No, I think if you look at, we have talked about offsetting option dilution, and typically, our first quarter is our largest quarter on options exercised and with restricted stock that's issued in the first quarter. So I think we are a little bit ahead of it. I would say the options didn't come in as heavy as we thought. So we'll monitor that as a year goes on and make sure that we meet our commitments that \u2013 and make sure we're paying down our debt to get our debt-to-EBITDA leverage down to approximately 3:1 that John talked about. ","Vincent Andrews","Thanks very much.","John Morikis","Thanks Vincent.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Mushkin","Hey guys, a lot of my questions have actually been answered. But, I have one, I think in the press release you guys talked about the choppiness of kind of the international markets. I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on that a little bit, kind of what you're seeing from the macro perspective in the industrial side of your business. ","John Morikis","Yeah, so when you look at our businesses, naturally, they don't move consistently across each business in one direction. So we have seen, in any region, some businesses performing better than others. But overall, collectively, those businesses are performing quite well. We've got a lot of confidence in the team. And I referenced just the terrific talent that's come from Valspar and the relationships that they have with their customers are just outstanding. ","So a little bit of choppiness, I think, is pretty normal. We've got a lot of confidence in the team. And as we combine these businesses, as I mentioned earlier, then we have a lot of synergies for growth. ","Scott Mushkin","Alright, perfect.","John Morikis","Thanks Scott.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Duffy Fischer","Yes, good morning. First question is just as we start to anniversary Valspar, the growth rate within Valspar businesses starts to matter more as we do our year-over-year. So within Consumer and Performance, how fast on a pro forma basis has the Valspar part of the business been growing?","Al Mistysyn","So if you look at the \u2013 certainly, in the quarter, both the Consumer business was up over 13%, and the Performance Coatings Valspar business was up a similar amount. I'd temper the consumer business a little bit. I don't think we're expecting double-digit gains. We'll take double-digit gains, but I don't think we're expecting that out of that team on a longer cycle. But you would expect low mid-single-digit growth across the group. I think that's where we're starting to look, Duffy, is we've integrated so much and made such great progress, specifically, as John mentioned, on Consumer. It's hard to look at Valspar versus Sherwin. ","So we look at the group, and we're expecting low to mid-single-digit growth in that group. On the Performance Coatings side, the momentum they have, we're expecting a little bit better than that. And again, they're well down the path of integration, and we're looking at a combined business, and our outlook is to say that mid-single-digit growth rate is \u2013 mid- to high single digit growth rate is probably what we're looking at. ","Duffy Fischer","And then relative to consensus, you guys beat the first quarter pretty handily. You just talked about you beat your own internal expectations, but yet you brought the year down the same $0.40 that the Lowe's stuff is going to hit you. With a bad first quarter weather-wise and some momentum there, theoretically, pickup feels like that means Q1 through Q4 is a little bit light relative to what your original expectations are. Can you just kind of help triangulate some of those numbers?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, sure. I mean first to be clear, we reaffirmed our original full year EPS guidance at the midpoint, and that's a 26% increase year-over-year. So you need to deliver, and we needed to deliver strong first quarter and get off to a strong start. As I mentioned, the tax rate was a little bit lower that gave us a little bit of a tailwind. We fully expect the full year to be in the next \u2013 rest of the quarters to be in the low to mid-20% range. And you know it, Duffy, our first quarter is our smallest and generally most volatile quarter of the year. It's been a long-standing practice of ours to wait and see how the painting season unfolds before considering revisions to the outlook. And I think that's served us well on the path, and we fully want to continue with that practice.","Duffy Fischer","Terrific, thank you guys.","John Morikis","Thanks Duffy.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. John Lowe\u2019s has a professional paint focus going forward. How do you make sure the incremental professional paints at Lowe's, to the expense of Home Depot or something else like that rather than your own Paint Stores?","John Morikis","Yeah, so there is a terrific opportunity there. When you thing about the painting contractor that's painting every day, they typically have gravitated towards a specialty paint store, and we work hard to make that easy for them. But there is an entire customer base when you think about the home centers. People that use paint in part of their projects or part of a remodel project that is a little more difficult for our teams to reach through a specialty store. So we think it's a terrific opportunity for us, along with our customer, Lowe's, to better penetrate that. And we don't think at all that it's cannibalizing our core business. It's typically customers that are in home centers that are purchasing other products, be it drywall or plumbing or whatever it might be and using paint as part of that project. And we're really excited about working with our customer to reach those customers in a new and increased rate. ","David Begleiter","Very good. John lastly, in Performance Coatings, how would you characterize level of competitors for price increases in these businesses?","John Morikis","I\u2019d say, when you think about this, when you think about the cost of goods, the raw materials represent 85% of the cost of goods. When the basket moves, you really need to get it. And our view is clearly on adjusting to the basket as it moves. I'd say that because nearly everyone probably has similar dynamics, many would feel the same pressure and probably have to take the same type of activities they hold. But we're more focused internally then we are from a competitive standpoint, and we let them make their decisions. We know we have to make ours.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question ","{***Epart-054***}","{***54-End***}","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes, hi, good morning. You guys clearly delivered on sales synergies by winning this Lowe's business. So question on this incremental business that you just won. Do you expect that to be a lower-margin business because of increased branding and marketing costs? And secondly, did you have to offer a lower price to win that business?","John Morikis","Well, we don't talk about specific pricing or customers. But I would tell you that the value here is in the branding and the opportunity to help our customer reach their goals. We clearly have a raw material basket that's moving. We think it's just good practice for us to have open discussions with our customers about our need to remain whole to be able to serve their business and help them grow. And so that's the nature of our business. We're not going to give any specifics, but I would say that it's going to help our profitability.","P.J. Juvekar","And is that help our profitability for next 12 months or is the profitability going to improve after the 12 months?","John Morikis","No. If I understand your question correctly, we're going to have a little bit of drag that Al talked about that. That's the $0.40 that we talked this year as the cost moves in. But moving forward, next year, we expect that's going to help us, and our goal is going to be to grow that in both sales and profitability going forward, not just the one year.","P.J. Juvekar","Okay. And then your LatAm business was quite strong. Revenues up 9.5%, profits were up. What are you seeing? Are you seeing a turnaround in Lat Am?","John Morikis","The market is definitely starting to show positive signs. I think our teams are executing well. But again, I want to be very clear. While we're pleased with the progress, there's a lot of work for us to continue to work on. And our teams are really honkered down trying to do the right things here.","P.J. Juvekar","Okay. Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks, P.J.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Koort","Thanks very much. Al, you guys gave an earnings number that excluded some of the one-offs that I think 3.57 was what you posted. Can you tell me what the EBITDA would be on a same basis?","Al Mistysyn","EBITDA was up 6% in the quarter for the core Sherwin. That would have been \u2013 give me one second. So we would have made the $414 million versus last year $391 million, so up 6%. As we talked about 5.51, 5.52 is the total.","Bob Koort","5.52 has the one-offs. I guess, I'm trying to extract it to make it a like-for-like to the EPS number.","Al Mistysyn","So you think about \u2013 it's about $30 million adjustment for the one-off. So I guess it would be at 30.","Bob Koort","And then on TiO2, do you guys have any desire to enter into these long-term contracts that the producers are seeking? Or do you think this is just typical hard-core commodity so why lock in anything now if it might loosen up down the line?","John Morikis","Bob, we have a terrific procurement team, as you know, and our goal is to do what's right. If they feel though \u2013 as though there's some benefit to lock up a piece or part of that, they have the ability to do that. We're not convinced that it has to be a one or zero here. We're looking at what's best for our shareholders long-term, and we'll take the appropriate action as they see fit.","Bob Koort","Got it. Thank you very much.","John Morikis","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Harrison","Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could comment just on the consumer business overall. The sales growth there was pretty good. Wondering, did you already see some additional load-in at Lowe's in the first quarter? Can you maybe walk through what you saw in sort of the different segments in consumer, including in Europe and in Asia?","John Morikis","Yes. So Mike, we did not begin to see the benefit of the new agreement at this point. The growth primarily came through North America through a cross-section of customers, but primarily in the national retail category. And I'll remind you the Consumer Group pursues four segments. There's national retail, MRO in commercial; other retail; and as you mentioned, Europe and a small business in Asia there. The other thing \u2013 other point before talking about those other areas, I'd say, we did face a softer comp in the first quarter. So we did have a benefit of that as well.","But when you look at the numbers, if we're going to move the needle, it's going to be in North America. The European business and Asia offer opportunities, but there's much smaller businesses. So there's a lot of effort going on there as the synergy opportunities are explored for technology and transfer just institutional knowledge, going both ways. But the reality is if we're going to be successful here, we've go to move the North American needle, and that's what we're working on the most.","Mike Harrison","All right. And then you guided to $600 million of incremental sales for the two months of Valspar in the second quarter. It looks like that's maybe a little slower pace than I have. And you did about 10\/60, $1.06 billion in the first quarter. Is that reflecting some of the changes with the big-box retailers? Or kind of how should we think about that contribution maybe being in the lower run rate than you were in the first quarter?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Mike, I wouldn't read anything into that. It\u2019s approximately 600 for April and May, and then it rolls into our comp going forward. But nothing of concern in that run rate.","Mike Harrison","All right. Thanks very much.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Sison","Hey, good morning guys. In terms of gross margin, when you think about the 42.5, where does that go for the rest of the year? And what's kind of the embedded gross margin for the full year embedded in your guidance?","John Morikis","Yes, we don't break out gross margin specifically in the guidance. But what I would just say is, as we talked about, our first half would be our toughest comparison on a raw material basis year-over-year. If raw materials trend like we believe they will, we should see sequential improvement. And I'll go back also, the original EPS guidance at $19.05, it's a 26% improvement. And embedded \u2013 implied in that is gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. That's the only way you can \u2013 we can get to those numbers.","Mike Sison","And your raw material outlook is still low single digits?","Al Mistysyn","Mike, its still 4% to 6% range, based on the first quarter running a little higher in terms of year-over-year inflation than we anticipated, we're likely going to push toward the higher end of that range for full year. Now as a reminder, that is our outlook for the industry on a basket similar to what we buy. That does not include raw material synergies.","Mike Sison","Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on the $0.40, as you head into 2019, will you overcome that $0.40, meaning that once you get the sales in from Lowe's and you you've got the costs embedded, is it a plus 40 plus next year?","Al Mistysyn","Yes. It will be a plus 40. We're not going to probably talk about how much of it more than that.","Mike Sison","Got it. Thank you.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Good morning, thank you. In response to an earlier question, I think you indicated potential for sales to Lowe's in the amount of nearly $200 million in 2019. My question is how would you characterize the amount of forgone sales at Home Depot relative to that number? And is there a timing difference between the load-in Lowe's versus the phase-out at Home Depot?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, Kevin, that was \u2013 the number I was quoting is the net number for 2019. As far as timing goes, Lowe's will dictate the cadence of the roll-ins, and Home Depot and that will happen this year as well. But much past that, we're not going to get into them a lot of the detail related to\u2026","John Morikis","I think out of respect to our customers, both Home Depot and Lowe's, we're going to allow them to announce when the different brands will be or will not be available.","Kevin McCarthy","Fair enough. I appreciate that clarification. That was a net number. And then second for Al, given the change in tax regime and the lower rate in the first quarter of 2018, do you see any downward tension in your rate? I know you're affirming low to mid-20% range. But was the 1Q level strictly discrete items? Or is there any residual effect that you foresee?","Al Mistysyn","Yes. The 1Q was the timing of the discrete items. And I would highlight, if you look at our core business, Valspar, Lowe's together, our effective tax rate was 19.4% versus last year of 22.7%. The impact of the acquisition-related costs drives the consolidated rate down. But really, nothing more than just timing of discrete items in that first quarter, a small quarter so has a bigger effect.","Kevin McCarthy","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Nishu Sood","Thank you. Wanted to ask about the synergies, in your commentary, John, you mentioned synergies contributing to margins in the Consumer Group, but didn't mention it in the margin commentary for Performance Coatings. And that may just been the different trends, I just wanted to dig into that a little bit. And should we expect here on 2018 kind of sequential basis different cadence of synergy realizations? So I just wanted to check into that, see if there was something behind that.","John Morikis","Yes, so if I didn't speak to the synergies, then the work that the team is doing on the Performance Coatings side, then that was an error on my part. A lot of good work and really terrific effort on the part of the Performance Coatings team as well. So yes, there are going to be synergies there. I will say that there are energies going to hit in 2018. And then as you look ahead, from a manufacturing standpoint, there'll be additional opportunities from an asset rationalization standpoint in the future that'll take a little bit longer as we get systems and processes in place to look at those outside of the U.S. that will benefit the Performance Coatings business the most.","Al Mistysyn","Yes. Nishu, let me add that just if you look at the cadence of midpoint that we talked about, $150 million by quarter, it's really more front-end loaded than back-end loaded. That related to the projects that have been validated as we went through last year that we see going through the P&L and feel confident about and then the back half is really getting impacted by new projects, system implementations that John talked about and then factory closures that I talked about earlier.","Nishu Sood","Got you. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And in terms of the Consumer Group, I know this will go away next quarter, but maybe the quarter after that, but in terms of the breakdown between the old legacy Valspar and the legacy Sherwin-Williams, quite a strong performance from the Valspar side of things, kind of continuation of trends on the Sherwin-Williams side of things. Wonder if you could just speak to that, and particularly, the acceleration on the legacy Valspar side.","John Morikis","Yes. So I mentioned this briefly earlier that the way this business is managed and run now, it's very difficult to account for a sale or synergy on one side or the other. So as we brought the businesses together, for example, the sales organization is a combined sales organization. There were some sales reps that \u2013 there are some sales reps that were previously from Valspar, some from Sherwin-Williams, same with products. And so this is an area, as I mentioned, that we made the most progress in integration. So it's very, very difficult to account one side or the other.","Our focus here is purely on doing what's right for the customer. And so if selling a gallon of Sherwin or a gallon of Valspar is what's right for the customer, we're pursuing that. We're adding that up and giving you that information as a legacy Valspar, legacy Sherwin. But it's not the way we are running the business, and it really doesn't account for the overall synergies and efforts that are taking place. It's probably the most area that's \u2013 the area that's most gray amongst all of them.","Nishu Sood","Got you, makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Rednor","Hey, Al, could you just clarify relative to the 1.40 to 1.60 of synergies this year, how much exactly was realized in 1Q?","Al Mistysyn","If you split it, the 1.50 by four quarters, we saw a little bit more than that in our first quarter. That's the way I would characterize it.","Scott Rednor","Okay, thank you. And then could you just talk to, on the paint store side within North America, the delta between interior, exterior, kind of what was the gap? And are you seeing that at all reverse here in April?","John Morikis","Naturally, the interior was much stronger in the first quarter so there were high single-digit gains in interior and we were positive in the low or mid-single exterior. This time of year, we would expect to see more exterior gallons going out in the Southeast and Southwest than what we did and Eastern\u2019s impact was probably significant as well. Not so much that they saw the impact on exterior, but just on completion of projects certainly has an impact on business there.","Scott Rednor","And then just \u2013 John, I mean, a few years ago, you guys put up a significant amount of SG&A spend into the Lowe's program. And safe to say that trailed some of the more robust expectations you have for that program back in 2014, 2015. How do you get confident that a higher level of spend right now you could get a return on that spend when you look to the next couple of years?","John Morikis","Well, it's every element of the business, Scott. If you start with the fact that we've got a partner here, who is committed to us and us to them in this area of their business, so the opportunity to work collectively on a brand assortment, the training of their people, the simplified branding if you just look at it from that standpoint, instead of having two or three different brands in there, with sales reps all calling on the sales associate giving their feelings on which is the right product to sell and what's situation, the ability to better train and have them more knowledgeable about the product technology, I mean, every aspect of the business, we think, is terrific and meaningful.","And when you look at the alignment that we have there, we think it's going to be a big win. Now that said, we talk a lot about their performance in North America. Their partners outside of that specific customer had a terrific first quarter as well. We've got great relationships with other customers that we're continuing to work, if it's Ace or Menard's or a whole host of other customers doing extremely well. So we're very pleased, and we're very focused on doing what's right for each one of these customers, and we think we've got some good momentum.","Scott Rednor","Great. Thanks. Thanks so much, John.","John Morikis","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Yes, thanks for taking my questions. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I just want to confirm something. In your Wood Coatings business, your competitor was talking about seeing some weakness there because of the way Chinese are coating at the plant rather than coating in the field. Are you seeing that in your wood business? Or is your wood business primarily sort of plant-applied coatings?","John Morikis","Well, there are two different areas there, Dmitry, right? There is the architectural type customers that apply wood in homes as well as the manufacturing. And there is a trend to having more of that product manufactured in a factory as opposed to staying and finished on projects.","Dmitry Silversteyn","And then how does it affect your business? And is it positive for you either on top line or margin or neutral or negative?","John Morikis","I'd say it's probably neutral. I mean, maybe \u2013 yes, it's an opportunity for us. When you look at our market share there, Dmitry, there's tremendous upside, and that's what we are focused on.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay, got it. And then just a bookkeeping question. Was there a foreign exchange benefit to your Performance Coatings revenue number? You provided for consumer and the Latin American piece, but I don't \u2013 maybe I missed it but not for performance.","Al Mistysyn","On Performance Coatings, the FX impact on our PBT was about $4.6 million.","Dmitry Silversteyn","$4.6 million, that's on profit, right?","Al Mistysyn","That's on profit.","Dmitry Silversteyn","So what was impact on revenue?","Al Mistysyn","So the 3.9% is the tailwind.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay, thank you very much.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks, Dmitry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.","Chuck Cerankosky","Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. I want to direct the question to Al, a technical question, Al. Looking at the purchase accounting impacts for the first quarter, there were $0.71, and the guidance was $2.65 for the full year, so not quite four times as much. Does that simply reflect the lower tax rate in the quarter? Are there some \u2013 or were there some one-time non-amortization items in the first quarter?","Al Mistysyn","There's about $30 million of non-amortization type items in the first quarter. And Chuck, we called out $100 million for the year on one-time integration costs. And the way that would roll out would be, second quarter would probably be similar to our first quarter, and then it'll drop down from there.","Chuck Cerankosky","All right, thank you on that. And then, John, when we're looking at pricing actions, Sherwin-Williams take, it seems that it's relatively easy, and I say that with much respect to get them through to the contractors. How do you look at same situation when you're talking to retailers and talking to OEMs?","John Morikis","Well, I wouldn't say that any pricing is easy, Chuck. What we're trying to do is, I think we have done historically and Valspar has done historically as well, and that is continue to provide products and services that allow our customers to be successful. We're in the solutions business, right? So we're bringing products and services that help them reach their goal. And when our raw material basket moves, we have open discussions with them to help them understand what's happening from our cost standpoint.","But I'd say this. It's not so much the discussion or that meeting that determines our success, Chuck. It's what we do all year. When we're working for our customers on a regular basis, helping them reach their goals, then as our cost goal, we are much more likely to be successful and having those cost discussions than having to come down to one discussion if you failed all years. So we're working hard every year to provide the great products and services that allow us to be successful when our raw material basket moves.","Chuck Cerankosky","Understood. Thank you very much.","John Morikis","Thank you, Chuck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts","Hi, good afternoon. You operate your own truck fleet in the U.S. Is the tightness in the trucking market allowing your control distribution to laid again any share or provide any extra advantage right now? And are your costs inflating like they are in the third-party trucking market?","John Morikis","The answer to your first question, I'd say that it is an important part of our service model. So the idea of being able to serve our customers with our fleet is one component, John, of what I just mentioned, having good service all year. We have about 700 drivers that operate 550 tractors, and they're an important part of our team. And so the ability to serve customers as a result of having our own drivers allows our drivers to make nighttime deliveries, for example, in our stores so that our store people could be more focused on our customers.","To your point about the flexibility, we can be responsive as opportunities arise to be there when our customers need us. As far as the costs, we have terrific retention of our employees, including our drivers because we pay a very competitive wage, and we'll continue to do that. There's not been significant price or cost increases here, but we're also very sensitive to what's happening in the market to make sure that we're paying our drivers appropriately.","John Roberts","Great. Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Melich","Thanks. I had a quick one for Al and then a follow-up on price and volume. Al, the 3x debt-to-EBITDA leverage where does that go once we make the lease accounting adjustment? Does that change it by a turn? Or how do we think about that?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, it won't change it. I think it'll change it by roughly a third to a half when we get the full impact of the leases on our balance sheet.","Greg Melich","Got it. That's how much it will go up so when you go to that target to stay under three that will \u2013 it will bump up that sort of the headwind that you have until next year?","Al Mistysyn","That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.","Greg Melich","Okay. And then on the business, I want to make sure I got the comp right and the price and volume mix. So the comp was 5.3. And let's say, price was 2, and volume was 3. Given that the rest of the year looks like the comp will need to be a couple of hundred bps higher, is that improvement in comp that you're expecting more from price increases rolling through or more from volume pickup?","Al Mistysyn","It's going to be from volume.","Greg Melich","So we should assume the price still stays around that 2 level?","Al Mistysyn","Yes, I mean, certainly, you get a little bit improvement as we continue to work with our customers, but it won't be significantly more than that.","Greg Melich","Okay, thanks a lot. Good luck, guys.","Al Mistysyn","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Patrick Lambert with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Lambert","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for picking. A few questions, this is mostly about the timing, timing of the $0.40 cost for developing Lowe's solution. If you could tell us that $0.20 in Q2 and Q3 and then almost breakeven in Q4, that's question number one. But the same question for synergies I think you've breaking the chance it would be above the same for each quarter, but just if you could confirm the impact of the synergies per quarter. And finally, raw materials, I try to get the absolute dollars headwinds in Q1. Is that still or is that a bit above $110 million of headwinds from raw materials? Thank you.","John Morikis","So on the timing of the Lowe's program, I would say it's going to be more heavily weighted to our third and fourth quarters. As far as the synergy, Patrick, like I said, it's pretty, pretty even throughout the quarters but a little more heavily weighted to our first and second quarters. And on the raw \u2013 just the pure raw material dollars, the $110 million, I think, you said, sounds a little bit heavier than what I would say but not really materially off.","Patrick Lambert","Its about $100 million.","John Morikis","Sure.","Patrick Lambert","Okay. That\u2019s it for me.","John Morikis","Thanks, Patrick.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander","Good afternoon. Just two quick clarifications, you have some comments, sorry, about how your customers have improved their productivity. Does that \u2013 in the architectural segment, does that imply that the summer volumes could be higher than your historical growth rates? Or do you see the soft start to the year as more just pushing out into creating pent-up demand that will be satisfied in Q4? And secondly, I don't think there's any ambiguous in this, but apparently, there might be. Which of the earnings ranges is the benchmarks that you will be using to build your bridge to 2019?","Al Mistysyn","So on what we're building, as our benchmark would be the consolidated, excluding the Valspar acquisition, 18.35 to 18.95. That's what I would have you focus on as our base going into 2019.","Bob Wells","And in terms of the comments on customer productivity, I think the comment was we are going to do everything power to help our customers improve their productivity, both through product performance and service model, in an effort to, frankly, help them catch up. They fell a little behind in the first quarter. They've got a lot of work to do. They're going to be, we're sure, working longer hours, more weekends, but we're going to participate in that.","Laurence Alexander","Perfect. Thank you.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Larry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for taking my question so late. I was wondering if you could give us some details on the packaging side. One of your competitor is making progress and said that they are gaining share on the non-BPA coatings. Could you help us understand what is happening there, first of all, in terms of what your growth is in that category and then whether the industry, at least in Europe, has already caught up and everyone is more or less non-BPA?","John Morikis","Yes. So the packaging business is our fastest-growing business in our Performance Coatings business. So we're thrilled with the momentum that we have there. The team is executing, and quite frankly, the technology that we have, we think we have a very unique technology that has really been very well accepted by our customers. And it's growing in acceptance here. And we're thrilled with it. It's performing very well. And from a market share standpoint, we think we're doing quite well.","Rosemarie Morbelli","All right. And if we look at the general industrial side, could you give us a feel for the trends and the categories which are showing more improvement year-over-year and continuing in that particular vein?","John Morikis","In general industrial, what you're talking about?","Rosemarie Morbelli","Yes.","John Morikis","Well, again, another strong performing area for our Performance Coatings business. They are having very good progress or they're making very good progress in various segments and different geographies around the world. So earlier there was a question about choppiness, and I made the comment about that it's not every business in every segment moving straight line. So here in the GI business, there are segments in, for example, North America that are doing very well, that may not be as performing strongly in other parts of the world. But collectively, that business is performing very well. Again, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, it's in the top two or three of the Performance Coatings segment.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Could you share with us which areas are not doing as well in North America, for example?","John Morikis","We don't \u2013 Rosemarie, we don't break into that business in great detail. But I'd say, overall, we're very pleased with the performance there. And this is another area, from a price standpoint, that they've got some very large customers. They've been working through pricing. And we're expecting to see price recovery in this space.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay, thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks, Rosemarie.","Operator","Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.","Bob Wells","Thank you, Jessie.

In the interest of time, we provided some balance sheet items and other select financial information on our website www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations January 28 press release.","Our consolidated sales in the fourth quarter increased 1.4%, $2.6 billion, due entirely to higher paint sales volume through our Paint Stores and Consumer Groups. For the full year, sales increased 1.9% to $11.34 billion. Unfavorable currency translation decrease consolidated net sales 3.6% in the quarter and 3.3% for the full year. Consolidated gross profit in the fourth quarter increased $104.3 million to $1.3 billion and gross margin expanded to 50.8% of sales from 47.4% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2014.","For the year, gross margin increased to 49% of sales from 46.4% of sales last year. The increase in gross margin in the quarter and full year was due primarily to volume driven supply chain productivity and lower year-over-year raw material costs. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $6.1 million to $991.5 million in the fourth quarter, but decreased as a percent of sales to 38.1% from 38.3% in the same quarter last year.","For the full year 2015, SG&A expense increased $90.6 million to $3.91 billion, an increase as a percent of sales to 34.5% from 34.3% in 2014. Incremental SG&A to support the new HGTV Home program at Lowe\u2019s, and new store openings and sales territory additions accounted for the majority of the SG&A increase in the year. Other general expense decreased $12.6 million in the fourth quarter and $7.2 million for the year due primarily to lower environmental expenses in both periods.","Interest expense for the quarter increased $4.1 million to $19.5 million. For the year, interest expense was $61.8 million compared to $64.2 million in 2014. Profit before tax in the fourth quarter increased 57.4% to $297.2 million, and for the full year, increased 23.1% to $1.55 billion. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2015 increased to 33.4% from 29.7% in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, our effective tax was 32% compared to 31.2% in 2014. Consolidated net income for the quarter increased $65.3 million to $198 million. For the year, net income increased $188 million to $1.05 billion.","Net income as a percent of sales in the quarter increased to 7.6% from 5.2% last year for the year net income as a percent of sales increased to 9.3% from 7.8% in 2014. Diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter 2015 increased to $2.12 from $1.37 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, diluted net income per common share increased 27.1% to $11.16 per share from $8.78 per share in 2014. Now let me take a few minutes to break down our performance by segment.","Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 5.9% to $1.68 billion, thanks to higher architectural paint sales volumes across all customer segments. For the year, net sales increased 5.2% to $7.21 billion. This full year sales increase was also driven by higher architectural paint sales volumes across all customer segments. Comparable store sales increased 5.1% in the quarter and 4.2% in the year.","Regionally, in the fourth quarter, our Mid-west divisions led all divisions, followed by Eastern division, Southeastern division and Southwestern term division. Fourth quarter segment profit for Paint Stores Group increased 27.8% to $316.1 million, due primarily to higher year-over-year paint sales volumes.","For the full year, Paint Stores Group profit increased 19.3% to $1.43 billion from $1.2 billion in 2014. The increase in segment profit for the year resulted from higher paint sales volumes that were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.","Segment profit margin for the fourth quarter increased to 18.9% from 15.6% last year. Profit margin for the full year 2015 increased to 19.9% from 17.5% in 2014.","Turning now to Consumer Group. Fourth quarter external net sales increased 13.6% to $314.6 million. For the year, Consumer Group sales increased 11.1% to $1.58 billion. Most of the increase in sales for the fourth quarter and full year was from the HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams Paint program at Lowe\u2019s. Segment profit for the fourth quarter increased 67.9% to $50.9 million from $30.3 million in fourth quarter 2014. For the year, segment profit increased 22.1% to $308.8 million from $252.9 million in 2014. ","Consumer Group\u2019s segment profit as a percent of net sales in the fourth quarter increased to 16.2% from 11% last year. For the year, segment profit margin increased to 19.6% from 17.8% last year. Most of the improvement in both fourth quarter and full year segment profit margins was from volume driven operating efficiencies.","For our Global Finishes Group, fourth quarter net sales in U.S. dollars decreased 9.5% to $454.8 million and full year sales decreased 7.9% to $1.92 billion due primarily to unfavorable currency translation. Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 7.1% in the quarter and 7.5% in the year. Stated in U.S. dollars, Global Finishes Group segment profit in the fourth quarter increased to $50.6 million from $39 million last year. The increase in segment profit in the quarter resulted from the good expense control and lower year-over-year raw material costs that were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which reduced segment profit $4.8 million. For the year, segment profit increased four tenths of a percent to $201.9 million from $201.1 million last year.","This full year profit improvement resulted from good expense control and lower raw material costs that were mostly offset by unfavorable currency translations of $26.5 million. As a percent of net sales, Global Finishes Group\u2019s operating profit was 11.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 7.8% last year, and 10.5% for the year compared to 9.7% in 2014. ","For our Latin America Coatings Group, net sales decreased 23.5% to $158.7 million in the fourth quarter and decreased 18.2% to $631 million for the full year, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation and lower volume sales, partially offset by higher year-over-year selling prices.","Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 21.4% in the quarter and 19.3% in the year. Stated in U.S. dollars, Latin America Coatings Group segment profit in the quarter decreased to $2.8 million from $13 million last year. For the year, segment profits decreased to $18.5 million from $40.5 million in 2014. The decline in segment profit in both the quarter and the year was primarily due to unfavorable currency translations and lower volume sales, partially offset by selling price increases.","Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $5.3 million in the quarter and $16 million in the full year. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 1.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 6.3% last year, and 2.9% for the year compared to 5.2% in 2014.","That concludes the review of our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2016. John?","John Morikis","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As we announced last October, on January 1 of this year, I assumed the duties of Chief Executive Officer. Back in 1971, British Rock Band THE WHO recorded the now famous lyric, Meet the new boss, Same as the old boss. In our case, the same may not hold true literally in every respect. But it is certainly true when it comes to our mutual confidence in the Company\u2019s strategy, our focus on growing market share through superior products and execution. Our adherence to key performance metrics like return on net assets employed. And net operating cash to sales and our shareholder friendly capital allocation. ","These are the things that will define the value of Sherwin-Williams in the years ahead. And I believe they are all moving in the right direction. 2015 was a year of ups and downs. Our full year revenue of $11.3 billion set a new record for the Company, but are well short of our original expectations. One reason for this was stronger currency headwinds than originally anticipated. Another was the weaker than expected demand for industrial coatings in certain categories. Particularly those used to maintain oil and gas production and storage assets.","And in the middle two quarters of 2015, we broke our long standing practice of not giving weather reports on earnings calls as heavy rainfall across much of the country clearly affected paint demand. This lower than expected revenue performance however, did not translate to lower than expected profit or cash flow. Our full year profit before tax, net income, earnings per share and net operating cash, all met or exceeded the expectations we set back in January 2015.","Net income eclipsed $1 billion in 2015 for the first time in our Company\u2019s history. This strong profitability in cash generation was largely due to the successful and accelerated integration of the Comex stores and consolidation of Comex manufacturing assets coupled with volume driven sales supply chain productivity in North America, good SG&A expense control and raw material cost tailwinds.","Looking ahead, we expect the year-over-year incremental margin benefit from the Comex integration to diminish as we go through 2016. Architectural paint sales through our Paint Stores picked up momentum in the fourth quarter but was again offset to some degree by negative volumes in protective and marine coatings. Sales to residential leasing contractors continued to grow at double-digit paces. Sales volumes to the new construction markets and DIY customers also increased compared to last year, but at a full place than residential repaint.","In total, Paint Source Group grew fourth quarter revenues by just under 6% with architectural paint volume growth outpacing revenues. In the fourth quarter, we opened 38 net new stores bringing our full year store opening total to 83 new locations. And our total store count at year-end to 4,086 stores in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean. We\u2019ve remained confident that our next milestone of 5,000 locations in North America is realistic and we intend to get closer to that goal by 90 to 100 stores this year.","Consumer Group also turned in a solid performance for the year. The launch of the HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams Paint program at Lowe\u2019s was one reason, but we also saw strong sales growth from another valued home center partner [indiscernible]. As a result Consumer Group\u2019s business grew by low-single digit percentage space in the fourth quarter. Markets and economic conditions outside North America continue to be very challenging. Sales volumes in most Latin American countries fluctuated modestly compared to fourth quarter of 2014, and with the exception of Brazil where volumes and revenues declined significantly. The impact of currency devaluation once again was worse than anticipated in the quarter.","Global Finishes Group also felt the brunt of softening industrial coatings demand and deteriorating currencies in both Europe and Latin America, but made progress in offsetting these effects through tight SG&A control. In 2015, we generated record net operating cash of $1.45 billion, thanks in part to the terrific working capital management by all of our operating segments.","In spite of the incremental working capital required to support the HGTV Home program at Lowe\u2019s, our working capital ratio at year-end dropped to 8.6% of sales from 10.1% last year. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was $963.5 million compared to $665.7 million last year. We used this cash from operations to fund capital expenditures increased our dividend and buyback shares for treasury. Our capital expenditures in 2015 totaled $234 million. Depreciation for the year was $170 million, and amortization was $28 million.","In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $185 million to $200 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects. In 2015, we\u2019ve returned more than $1.28 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 1 million shares of the Company\u2019s stock for treasury, bringing our full year to 3.575 million shares at an average cost of $278.57 per share, and a total investment of just over $1 billion.","At year-end, we have remaining authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. We paid $249.6 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends. 2015 marked our 37th consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a stream we intend to continue. This year, at our February meeting of the Board of Directors, we will recommend approval of an annual dividend of $3.36 per share, an increase of more than 25% over 2015.","Looking ahead to 2016, the demand for paint and coatings in most domestic markets looks encouraging. Growth in residential starts and existing home turnover was solid throughout 2015 and the outlook for 2016 is equally encouraging. Although, contracts for new non-residential projects dipped slightly in 2015, it was still a strong year in absolute terms, which bodes well for paint demand in the segment.","Outside the U.S., it appears likely that sluggish market conditions and currency devaluation particularly in Europe and many Latin American countries will remain a challenge. Our raw material basket has many moving parts. But in total, we believe we\u2019re likely to see lower year-over-year input cost in 2016. The continuing fall in the price of crude oil will no doubt have a positive impact on these petrochemical side of the raw material basket.","But these commodities will not necessarily move in linear relationship with crude. The price of high-grade chloride TiO2 continued to slide over the back half of 2015, due to weak global demand and over capacity, but bottom. Based on these factors, we would expect average year-over-year raw material cost for the paint and coatings industry to be down in the mid-single digit range in 2016.","Our outlook for first quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the low-single digit percentage range compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. With sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter will be in the range of $1.50 to $1.65 per share, compared to $1.38 per share earned in the first quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect net sales will increase in the low-single digit percentage range compared to full year 2015. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2016 will be in the range of $12.20 to $12.40 per share, compared to $11.16 in 2015.","Again, I like to thank you for sharing \u2013 yes, being with us this morning. And now we\u2019d like to - be happy to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts","Good morning, guys.","John Morikis","Good morning, John.","John Roberts","John, I think, one of the big tip on that. \u201cThe Who\u201d album was won\u2019t get pulled again. On that note, what is your thinking about raw materials, given the volatility in oil as your guidance assuming relatively, conservatively not much benefits here it\u2019s going to take some time for oil to work its way down the supply chain?","Bob Wells","John, this is Bob. We think that there could be some benefit in the petrochemical side of the basket maybe as much as we saw in 2015. We think that, we saw a pretty big move in TiO2 in 2015 and we\u2019re unlikely to see that figure move in 2016. So mid-single-digit I think is a reasonable outlook for the industry. And well as we usually develop a catch as we go through the year.","John Roberts","And then, it is 83 store openings per year for the Paint Stores segment, is that right rated to be a kind of steady state there?","John Morikis","Yes. I think there\u2019s about average for us. Will adjust that as we go but I think that\u2019s about where we want to run.","John Roberts","Okay. Thank you.","Bob Wells","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Mehul Dalia","Hi. Good morning and this is actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you guys doing?","John Morikis","Hi, Mehul.","Mehul Dalia","First up, 4Q same store sales is an acceleration over 2Q and 3Q, so just wanted to know what changed and how did the non-architectural piece perform on a relative basis compared to the previous two quarters.","Sean Hennessy","If you look at the \u2013 this is Sean Hennessy. And so I\u2019ll take first \u2013 the second part first. I think that non-paint sales performed fairly well. I think that consistently throughout the year, we had a nice year in the non-paint sales but they accelerated also. I think that the Paint Store Group had a very nice quarter and there is chance have we don\u2019t usually talk about weather, but the maybe weather helped us a little bit. But I think that what\u2019s when you look at the second and third quarter versus fourth quarter. We did use weather in the second and third quarter. Thank you. You see parts of that.","Mehul Dalia","Got it. Also what\u2019s your estimate how the industry grew in the U.S. how it changed on perspective in 2015 and what are your expectations for 2016.","Bob Wells","Yes. Mig, this is Bob. We have very few data sources to go to help us with estimates of industry volume. The American Coating Association models industry volume over the course of year. They currently stand at an estimate of 5.5% growth for 2015, we think they are a little high. We were thinking more in the 3% to 3.5% range but as we collect more data, year-end data, we'll kind of fine-tune that outlook but I think it's likely the industry will end up in the 3% to 3.5% range.","Mehul Dalia","And your expectation for 2016 similar 3% to 3.5%?","Bob Wells","It could be a little stronger than that. It depends on the weather patterns relative to last year, but that's not a bad range.","Mehul Dalia","Great, and just one last one before I turn it over. With the three selling season, quickly approaching, can you talk about some of the lessons learned at Lowe's in 2015 and if any strategy shift or anything that you guys are going to do in 2015. Thank you.","John Morikis","Yes. I don't think there is a strategy shift at all. I think lessons learned include the importance of being very responsive obviously to our customers. Really working well with associates in the aisles and helping them to be successful and knowledgeable in our products. So I think we've got a very good strategy there. I think we've got a very good relationship there and I think we're working very hard to be the best customer there as we do with all of our customers. ","Mehul Dalia","Great, thank you so much. ","John Morikis","Thanks, Mehul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson","Yes, question for Sean just on gross margin. Just when we think it can't get any better it does, so particularly in the fourth quarter. So I'm wondering how much of that was volume driven was there any sort of true up against your standard cost [indiscernible] turned out to be lower than you originally thought when you made the estimate on standard costing. And what's been your outlook for next year if you in the year on a 50.8% gross margin that signal a pretty strong performance as we get into the paint season this year? ","Sean Hennessy","Yes. Don, if you take a look at that 340 basis points approximately half of that was due to the paint volume increases for our North American supply chain. That's really the number one thing that drove it. That also includes integration of that Comex business that has been a nice piece of that. Also you have to remember the mix because of the foreign currency exchange. As U.S. becomes bigger and bigger piece of that, of our total sales, our paint store group does have the highest gross margin. So that helps on the other piece. Now having said that LIFO is always trying to catch what you think is going to happen with the laws and the way the raws came in a was a slight help from the LIFO. LIFO did help us especially in the Consumer Group and also a little bit in the Storage Group. If you take a look about the long-term, in the long-term I think we try to give you guidance what we think is long-term we think probably our long-term when you look at the makeup of the company and where we are going is in the mid-47 to the mid-49s.","I think that again when that foreign currency changes around instead of being at 80% U.S. in North American sales you\u2019re going to start seeing that come down back into the 70s, that will have the reverse impact on the gross margin so when we feel like we\u2019re running at a normal area we think we are going to be in the 47.5% to 49.5% gross margin.","Don Carson","Sean, what was the LIFO adjustment either in dollars or percentage terms?","Sean Hennessy","We are not going to break that out. I would tell you that it was a help because you asked that question I wanted to point that out but it\u2019s not enough that we\u2019re going to put it in the K.","Don Carson","Alright, thank you.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Don.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","PJ Juvekar","Hi, good morning.","Bob Wells","Good morning PJ.","PJ Juvekar","Just on follow up on HGTV rollout that you had last year I understand that you were delayed in some stores and then you had a wet spring so given on that last year what are your expectations for this year in terms of volume growth and what are your margins for HGTV paint?","Sean Hennessy","I\u2019m going to jump in real quick. I just want to remind everyone we\u2019ve over the years have been very careful not to break out customer P&Ls and because of the differentiating factor of HGTV in 2015 we try to give you some guidance but we really don\u2019t have any kind of plans to break the sales or the absolute gross margins or the operating margins. We think it\u2019s in our core now and you\u2019re going to see it going on in the future but so from that standpoint I think we are going to shy away from giving that customer specific P&L but John you might want to comment? On the sales side I think we expect.","John Morikis","As I mentioned, we are working closely with all levels of Lowe\u2019s, and we\u2019re feeling good about the momentum as I mentioned. I think it\u2019s a matter of execution now and as I said we\u2019re going to focus on being the best partner we can for them and every customer that we have.","PJ Juvekar","And John, you have just under 4,100 stores today and you said 5,000 is the target is that a saturation point for you in terms of numbers of stores and when do you think you might get there? Thank you.","John Morikis","Let me be clear 5000 is not our target, it\u2019s a milestone. And I often say that \u2013 I refer to it because it\u2019s between 4000 and our next number 6000 and so we\u2019re going to stop at 5000 on the way. We don\u2019t see a saturation point. We continue to add stores each of our district managers maintain a real estate strategy and a plan to continue to invest in their stores and there\u2019s not a one of them that is raised their hand to say that the and really see no additional markets that they can add to. It\u2019s our expectations that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in those markets and continue to penetrate the opportunities in those markets and we are excited about that.","PJ Juvekar","Is there a particular area where you want to add stores?","John Morikis","We are obviously looking at the West Coast. We shared with the community here that we look at households per paint store and we see a terrific opportunity in the West area of the country and again we remain very confident in this model. This model in our ability to grow market share and to grow our operating leverage as we grow that incremental volume that gives us that confidence.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Duffy Fischer","Good morning, fellows.","John Morikis","Good morning, Duffy.","Duffy Fischer","In question there\u2019s a number of ways just to triangulate it, but if you look at it Q4 you delivered and in the Q1 that you\u2019ve guided to just take the mid-point in extrapolate that through 2016 there\u2019s a disconnect between how good those quarters were and kind of where the mid-point is for 2016. Is there something in the back three quarters where there\u2019s a little bit a step down that we should take into account or is that just a good case of conservatism?","John Morikis","No, I think when you look at it way you just guided us to I think the first quarter, I just want to remind you in Consumer Group because of the HGTV expenses if you remember the SG&A expenses \u2013 we had a jump in the first quarter and we pointed out last year that that was going to be 100% SG&A, zero sales. So I think this year we\u2019re going to have relatively close to the same amount of SG&A but some sales going against it so. I think that helped us. I think if you look over two years I think the first quarter would look more normal to you and would probably look more like the other three quarters we have in the guidance.","Duffy Fischer","Okay great. And then one of the issues in 2015 was it seems like your customers were running up against their bandwidth as far as just the number of painters they could employ. Is your sense that they have been able to expand their paint force and therefore the opportunity for more sales is bigger this year in the U.S?","John Morikis","That\u2019s improved to some degree. It\u2019s hard to put your fingers exactly on that but I\u2019d say in the market I think it\u2019s gotten a little better.","Duffy Fischer","Okay great. Thanks fellows.","John Morikis","Thank you, Duffy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Koort","Hi, John. Good morning.","John Morikis","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Koort","I was curious what your appetite was for spending money down in South America opportunistically and what\u2019s going on down there or maybe there\u2019s a little bit of greater fear about forging ahead more aggressively what are your thoughts on?","John Morikis","I think there\u2019s a little difference everywhere. I think that two years ago we were really nervous about putting money down in Argentina. And when you think about the exchange rate now with 13 times you look at Chile now they\u2019ve changed their government out, so we feel okay investing in Chile. Recovery long-term we still feel good about Brazil but we\u2019re watching both of those governments and seeing what happens with some of the policies down there. If the right opportunity would appear we would actually buy it. I think that we still are looking at the long-term, but I think on the marginal investments we\u2019ve been very careful on what we\u2019re going to spend down there.","When I say marginal I\u2019m not talking about distribution, or manufacturing, or marketing. I think more on the admin side, system sides those kinds of sides how much working capital will allow it to grow and so forth. We\u2019re watching it. We feel good about that. We\u2019re still cash positive each and every country and that really helps us stay the course. But, we think eventually it might be a while it was interesting we were going through what we went through in the late 80s and early 90s when we actually had to do inflationary accounting in South America which I had to look at some of the rules like it had been so long. We take a look at this spot and we\u2019re watching these things but we\u2019re being careful on the margins.","Bob Koort","In a follow-up, what are you seeing in results in Canada given the commodity influence growth rates there and what you see the path forward for 2016?","John Morikis","Okay, we don\u2019t break it by region but I could say directionally as you would expect the oil and gas market there has experience the pressure that one would expect. We are growing in the market our acquisitions of the brand that came along with Comex general paint are in the process of integrating that in and we\u2019re really excited about the momentum we\u2019re gaining up there. On the architectural side we are continuing to grow the Protective and Marine side we continue to see some pressure.","Bob Koort","Got it, thanks so much.","John Morikis","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with our question.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks I\u2019ve got a few quick ones. Starting with the fourth quarter you beat the consensus estimate by about $0.18 and I couldn\u2019t help noticing that your guidance range for the entirety of 2016 is about $0.20, so I\u2019m just wondering why the range seems so narrow for 2016. Maybe we could start there?","Bob Wells","If you took a look at the guidance we gave at the beginning of 2015 about a year ago we gave you $0.20 and $10.90 to $11.10. I think we\u2019ve changed this spend many, many times. Back in 2009 we gave you a guidance range of $1. I think there\u2019s been a lot of moving parts but I think that we feel confident that we\u2019re able to \u2013 whether it happens, adjust to different things I would think we\u2019re going to be able to get that kind of improvement.","Vincent Andrews","Okay and then on your tax rate in the fourth quarter stepped up a bit. How should we think about that tax rate in 2016?","Bob Wells","Yes. I think that when we take a look at it the full year was about 32.1%. I think it\u2019s going to be approximately right around that number to maybe - if it comes in at 31.5% or 32.5% I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And then lastly what\u2019s on the guidance you have an FX headwind baked in there?","Bob Wells","Yes. We do. just think about how the Brazilian real, even the Canadian dollar we are talking about before we definitely have a foreign currency. Foreign currency when you take a look at 2015 was much higher than we originally expected because I think everybody knows how the currencies are going and we thought it was prudent we definitely have foreign currency headwind in there.","Vincent Andrews","And how much is it?","Bob Wells","We don\u2019t break that out. Because there are so many different currencies and so forth but it\u2019s significant.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thanks very much.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Vincent.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks, good morning guys.","Bob Wells","Good morning Arun.","Arun Viswanathan","Good morning. I just had a couple of questions. Following questions on the guidance topic can you help us understand maybe what you were thinking as far as architectural and paint stores and then the other segments on the top line basis looks like you\u2019re guiding to low single digits for the full Company. Do you expect more of the same i.e. weakness in Protective and Marine and our performance in architectural?","Bob Wells","I will tell you that, when we look at our guidance I think the fourth quarter is pretty interesting. Total we were at 1.4% sales gain, Store Group was 5.9% so four times what we thought that we are going to be at. I think that currency other things, I think that, we don\u2019t break out our guidance by segment but I think that to give you some indication that tells you where we think the growth is going to be","John Morikis","But we do see to your point the issue of Protective and Marine we expect that pressure is going to continue for the foreseeable future.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. And then, this is just as a follow-up on the raw side obviously some decline incremental in 3Q and 4Q. If I go through the math I guess you expect that to continue to be a benefit in 2016. Is there any reason why we shouldn\u2019t expect a nice benefit on the raw side and maybe you could just elaborate on the oil versus TiO2?","Bob Wells","Yes. Arun, and this is Bob. We do expect to continue to see benefit from raw materials and we\u2019ve commented that on the oil side it does take longer for a drop in propylene and ethylene to work its way through the acrylic chain and actually get to market. So there\u2019s probably more tailwind on that side of the basket in the year to come than there is on the TiO2 side. TiO2 took a pretty sharp drop in the back half of last year. We\u2019ll see that obviously the benefit of that in the first half of this year but TiO2 is approaching kind of its historic starting place of $100 pound on the spot market. So we don\u2019t necessarily see a lot of further runway for TiO2 to decline.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks. Just one more thing up I can get in on the share buyback side what you are guys expecting to do in 2016? Thanks","Bob Wells","I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent with our cash utilization and I think that we feel pretty good about the cash generation of the Company. I think we\u2019ve been consistently generating cash and strong cash over the last 15 or so years and I\u2019m going back to when we took, we\u2019re put into these jobs. I think you\u2019re going to see us continue to invest in the business in CapEx in new stores and so forth. I think that we\u2019re going to pay out dividends. You heard the dividend going over $3.30. And then, when we look at acquisitions and we\u2019re going to look at buying back stock and I would tell you I\u2019d be surprised if we were holding cash at the end of next year.","Arun Viswanathan","Thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks Arun.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Senyek","Hi this is actually Chris on for Aram.","Bob Wells","Hey, Chris.","Chris Senyek","I had a couple questions. One is housekeeping. Can you give us the gross profit segment by segment by any chance?","Sean Hennessy","Sure. Just give me one second here. Paint Store Group was up $97.8 million in the quarter. Consumer Group $27.5 million. Global Finishes Group was down $4.8 million and Latin America was down $15.1 million.","Chris Senyek","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just want to dig in a few brief questions in terms of Global Finishes, so what you attribute like a sudden step up and profitability obviously GM is going help a little bit but what made major improvements did you put on the cost side and how sustainable is that in the next several quarters?","Sean Hennessy","Right. When we look at that Global Finishes Group in the fourth quarter was up 29% it was the operating profit was really driven by SG&A expense control. And favorable raw material costs which more than offset the negative currency because they had to go against currency also and I would tell you we feel pretty good about this SG&A savings that we have. I will tell you years ago when this Global Finishes Group was operating at 3% to 3.5% after we bought the Becker, Sayerlack and Inchem acquisitions, we said eventually we felt that could run at 12% and so we think that we\u2019re at a pretty good spot. We think in the future a lot of that improvement has come from those efficiencies we are going to get and I think in the future it\u2019s going to be driven by market share gains and sales gains.","John Morikis","Team there has done a really nice job of streamlining the noncustomer facing functions and give their team a lot of credit for continuing to focus on that.","Chris Senyek","Okay. Great. And this one quick one. You called out in the \u2013 one potential reason for strength in the consumer segment was there something going on there in terms of a new program launch or you can name it from that what kind of drove that strength?","Sean Hennessy","We have a very good relationship with a very good customer there. And so we are continuing to focus our efforts there as I mentioned earlier we want to be the best supplier to each of our customers and so we\u2019ve really just tried to listen to a very good customer being responsive and help them grow and that\u2019s our game plan.","Chris Senyek","Alright, great. All thanks. Thanks again.","John Morikis","Welcome Chris","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Rednor","Hi. Good morning.","Sean Hennessy","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Rednor","I just want a better understand the planning assumption for 2016 you guys posted 27% earnings growth last year and over the past four years it\u2019s been about 20% to 25% on average in this year that you are guiding to 10%. despite the fact you continue to feel good about the architectural paint market and raw material tailwind so I guess there is an offset from Comex not being as accretive but what else is in the budget that we should consider that should contribute to lower earnings throughout the share?","Sean Hennessy","I think that the FX headwinds, where I would say be a little more our estimate is a little stronger than it was going into last year. I think that Comex was a really strong one and I think you heard Bob\u2019s comments about raw materials. Even though they are going to be a nice tailwind I don\u2019t see the tailwind being as strong in 2016 as it was in 2015.","Scott Rednor","And now you guys done on Comex. I thought the previously Comex you had a multi-year runway so what inning are you in with that integration?","Sean Hennessy","I would say we are in inning eight. That the bottom of the eighth and the home team is winning big. I think we\u2019re going to see it, we were able to accelerate it.","John Morikis","Who we do sort out the \u2013 we are continuing to invest in the store transitions over team Sherwin so Sean\u2019s point largely on the supply chain side I think that team did a terrific job and we\u2019ve clearly moved some of that up from what we have expected to see in 2016 into 2015. And we were successful also on the store side but there\u2019s still some work to do on the store side and that\u2019s what we are working on here as we roll into 2016.","Scott Rednor","Great. Very helpful. And just one last one for you Sean. The cash flow conversation for sales, that you guys kind of talked to investment community about it, right around 13% this year is that is it something unusual or is that kind of the new run rate of the company going forward?","Sean Hennessy","I think we were helped with if you look at the working capital again we define working capital as receivables plus, inventory minus payable was driven all the way down to 8.6% and I would tell you that our long-term goal is to reduce that working capital as a percent of sales. So that we can go from 10% to 11% and the long-term cash as a conversation from sales and I will tell that our working capital at 8.6%. our inventory is in great shape. Our receivables are in great shape but I think our payables were favorably impacted by timing of some payments year-over-year. So I think that our payables, the accounts payable will be lower next year which will raise the working capital backup into that, our more near-term target of about 10% of sales. So I think the 13% is nice and I think it was just because of the timing of payments. I think you\u2019re going to see us going back in that 10% to 11% of sales in the future.","Scott Rednor","Great. Nice quarter, guys. Thanks for all the detail.","Sean Hennessy","Thanks Scott.","John Morikis","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Melich","Hi. Thanks. I had a couple hopefully housekeeping follow-ups it sounds like - do you give a number for what raws were down in 2015 and love that and also buyback is or isn\u2019t in the guidance for EPS?","Bob Wells","On the raw material question, Greg. We said that for the full year over 2014 raw materials would be down in the mid-single digits. In the back half we mentioned the fact it was trending a little higher than that or at the high-end of mid-single digits just due to the trajectory of materials over the course of the year.","Greg Melich","And it sounds like given what Sean said that probably finish that the high-end so maybe down 6% or 7% the higher end of mid-single digits?","Bob Wells","For the second half.","Greg Melich","It\u2019s over 2015. We could that raws were down at high-end of mid-single digit.","Bob Wells","Now for the full year, you\u2019d be in the mid singles.","Greg Melich","You\u2019d still be in the singles but more in the back half. Got it.","Bob Wells","Yes.","Greg Melich","And then on the buyback and EPS?","Bob Wells","We definitely have in our guidance some buybacks. We did not have any cash were not holding any cash in our guidance for the end of the year.","Greg Melich","Okay. Great. And then really, I want to ask business it looks like that fourth quarter demand trend nice improvement with the comp. What was the volume comp when you packed out mix and what accounted for the acceleration if you think about it versus second and third quarter was it architectural was it maybe some of the other weaker businesses not being as weak?","Sean Hennessy","It was largely the architectural, Greg and if you look at what we\u2019ve seen there clearly it\u2019s an improvement in third quarter over fourth quarter and we continue to be excited and encouraged by the comments we\u2019re hearing from many of our customers. Our home builders that saw a more mild weather which enabled them to catch up on some of the lost work days that were previously an issue. There\u2019s just a momentum there that we are working hard to make sure we capture more than our share.","Greg Melich","And if you look ahead on the commercial side do you think the backlog there looks like acceleration as well?","Sean Hennessy","The nonresidential side didn\u2019t slowdown in 2015 to 2014. What we feel as an absolute number it was still a good performance. Our relationship in this business as we look at the large commercial contractors and how we are positioned there we feel really good that with the market we\u2019ll grow well beyond behind what the market trends will grow. We\u2019ve got a very good position here. We work hard on every aspect from product specifications color and we expect to get again quite a bit of that share as we grow into 2016.","Bob Wells","The other issue to keep in mind on the non-res new side is that there is a long lag between starts and paints in that market so starts were strong in 2014 and just down slightly in 2015 so that bodes pretty well for painting on new construction new nonresidential construction in 2016.","Sean Hennessy","So if you look at residential repaint we been experiencing double-digit gains here for quite some time we\u2019ve got good momentum there good position in the commercial side and we expect as Bob mentioned that that pipeline is going to work in our direction.","Greg Melich","That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot and good luck.","Bob Wells","Thanks Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Nils Wallin","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I believe you said that paint volume in the stores group was greater than revenues and revenue growth that is and so given your estimation of 3% or 4% overall growth for the paint gallons it suggests that you are probably taking share. How would you characterize those share gains? Are you actually seeing competitors close down or you just somehow that their growth is \u2013 there are not opening stores as fast as you are? And then finally, are you actually seeing any distributors kind of leave the business. Independent distributors?","Sean Hennessy","Well. There are stores that close. It really varies by market. It\u2019s a very fragmented market and we compete with local competitors so each market is bit different and we often say inside our four walls that we don\u2019t discriminate by where we will grow our share. Some of them will be larger competitors and some of them might be smaller but our teams locally are focused on their customers that offer opportunity and it may be in any channel that they see those opportunities but they are really focused on growing and we\u2019re winning. We feel pretty good about the pace in which we are winning.","Bob Wells","The other thing I would point out, we didn\u2019t commented on over the last couple of years we\u2019ve done very well with international accounts since the recession as a consolidated supplier base we are the only paint supplier that has a truly national footprint of contractor friendly outlets so that helped us a lot in that arena.","Nils Wallin","Got it. And then where are you in terms of your capacity to supply the market? Do you anticipate you\u2019ll need to expand capacity in the next two to three years or it\u2019s maybe five years out?","Sean Hennessy","I think that the when we take a look at the capacity I think our manufacturing footprint has been expanded each and every year from efficiencies. We\u2019ve taken a look at our capacity utilization. we\u2019re in nice shape. We went through a nice growth here we did an integration of Comex. We might see down the road five years where we might have to do some type of major expansion on our plant but in the short term here we don\u2019t have a game plan to open a new plant.","Bob Wells","The teams are doing a really nice job as Sean mentioned in some of those investments might be on our billing line or something like that but we\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s got a mindset of continuous improvement and they are working hard to capture additional capacity.","Nils Wallin","And then just one final one, I know that stated all year some of the raw material headwinds in your Latin American coatings group is there any opportunity to change sourcing\u2019s that you don\u2019t have going forward.","Sean Hennessy","I tell you why. What happens with most of the major raw materials. So 87% of raw materials where purchasing down there. Our purchase spend U.S. dollar, so when the raws go down mid-single-digit I will say five and then currencies fluctuates losses 25% to 30% such as in Brazil. your raws on a local basis are going to go up. That\u2019s really the big driver not sitting here saying can we go from one supplier to another.","Nils Wallin","Got it. Thanks very much.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Nils.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.","Chuck Cerankosky","Good afternoon, everyone.","Sean Hennessy","Hi. Chuck.","Chuck Cerankosky","Tomorrow afternoon. First John can you talk about where pricing might go in the Paint Stores Segment in 2016?","John Morikis","Well, we\u2019ve not announced the price increase and Chuck as you know many years of falling us our first communication is to our customers and then we would quickly update you as quickly as we can but right now we\u2019ve not announced anything.","Chuck Cerankosky","Should we assume that the shelf prices will at least be stable?","John Morikis","Yes I\u2019d say that\u2019s a safe bet. Yes.","Chuck Cerankosky","Okay. What about the interest rate in environment? Any comments on that about what it might be doing to end market demand specially on the architectural side, residential architectural side?","John Morikis","I think Chuck. You\u2019ve seen a lot of projects. It\u2019s seems like people are still investing, the markets are open. The interest rates are low but we\u2019re watching the starts and so forth. I think it really comes down to if they can utilize these assets they are investing in them.","Chuck Cerankosky","Now what are you referring to Sean when you say utilizing assets?","Sean Hennessy","Whether it\u2019s commercial or people building multi-family dwellings and so forth that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.","Chuck Cerankosky","And then a question based on something you mentioned earlier the call you were integrating general paint in Canada, could you provide a little detail about that? Will that banner go away?","John Morikis","Much like we did with every past acquisition that we\u2019ve done with every past acquisition we look at the customer base and the customer dictates to us the pace in which we move the Sherwin-Williams brand is the ultimate brand that we end up with. Some of these products then end up a sub brand inside our Sherwin-Williams stores. We are able to leverage the advertising and the communications that we have that promote the Sherwin-Williams brand once they become a Sherwin-Williams banner store. And so we move in that direction but we move at the pace that we are able to get through the tunnel and in short when we get to the other side that we have our customers with us. ","Chuck Cerankosky","And then in the guidance it sounds like Latin America Sean, you guys are being very cautious on everything from currency to the regional economies. Is there anything else that we should think about in terms of the Latin America segment? ","Sean Hennessy","No. I think you hit on them. I think that the basic business is again we're watching it. We have not forecast the Brazil is going to be robust economy next year Argentina will be. I think we'll see what happens in Chile. Mexico seems to be doing fine but I think when you look at some of these areas. There is a reason why the currency continues to devalue and I don't see Brazil being a positive this year.","Chuck Cerankosky","All right. Thank you very much.","John Morikis","Thanks [indiscernible] ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you for taking my question after the timeframe just for me, John when you talk about being \u2013 Comex being at the bottom of the eighth inning whatever that means. Does that mean you are done about three quarters done in terms of the integration of what you want to do? ","John Morikis","Rosemarie, this is John. Because I was trying to make the point that John came back and said that on the operational side, on the admin side, on the systems side, the integration of raw materials and so forth. I would tell you we've completed that. Where the pieces that haven't been completed is what John said about the general paints and different pieces there. But inside United States, I would say all the operational and the reason I said bottom of the eighth is to referred that some of the incremental gains we expected were brought forward into 2015 and that's what I was referring to is the EPS gains. ","Sean Hennessy","Right. And so those improvements are now part of our everyday operations. We've taken those facilities out of the supply chain and now we're running those volumes through our existing plants and the additional point that I was making Rosemarie was that now our focus become how do we get the most throughput on each of those stores? Some that had transitioned earlier and some that were in the process now but now that they've been \u2013 many of them been converted to Sherwin stores, our opportunity to grow our sales in many segments that they weren't selling in the past become the opportunity moving forward. ","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you. That is helpful. And still in the Consumer Group last year, you were building the channel at Lowe's, so as the margin benefited from strong volume. Are we to expect a slightly lower volume because now it is really repurchasing a selling at the channel? ","John Morikis","I would say yes because 100% of the architectural paint we've sold to Lowe's last year was incremental. So and the other reason at our core we \u2013 that's definitely was 100% incremental this year. Last year in 2015 and 2016 will not be.","Rosemarie Morbelli","So how much do you think it will cost you about 100 basis points or could be impact of the lower volume being higher than that?","John Morikis","You know what, we will see but it's definitely going to \u2013 it will definitely be a reduction.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay, thanks. And on the Ti02 the producers have been announcing several price increases, they all seem to be getting their act together. Are you taking it or in part of your comments about the fact that now it's the bottom meaning a low floor or a beginning of price increases on the Ti02.","John Morikis","Yes, Rosemarie. We often comment that these pricing cycles in Ti02 typically begin with pricing below $1 a pound. Oftentimes peak above $2 a pound and then settle back on the back end of the cycle below $1 a point again. We're hovering just above $1 a pound. And we realize that there's been price increase announcements in the market. Ultimately, the balance of supply and demand in the market will determine whether those increases our successful and we'll see, but it feels like we are approaching the bottom on the downside of this cycle.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. And you find that the supply demand is getting I mean could it be balance by the end of this year or that is too early and we need another couple of years.","John Morikis","I think it's too early. It really depends on demand growth. Demand growth outside of North America has been very weak.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. And lastly if I may, could you bring us up-to-date on some of the press releases that you have published saying that you are working with Lowe's towards introducing other product lines. Can you give us a feel of what that is and then tell us how the antibacterial is doing? I know it's early, but.","Bob Wells","Let me start with your question on the \u2013 on our product paint seal it's exciting new technology for us. It's the first EPA registered paint that kills 99% of these five specific infection causing bacteria that have been exposed for two hours and there's nothing like it in the market, nothing. And so we're excited about it. It actually lands and it begins to sell in our stores beginning February 1. So you are right. It is little bit early. We just finished up our sales meetings with our team where we've done some extensive training with our team on the product and we're really looking forward to it. We did launch it last year and the feedback from the medical community has just been outstanding. It's just terrific. We\u2019re very excited about it. So we're looking forward to a good year with the product.","Rosemarie Morbelli","That is in the new category [indiscernible] ","Bob Wells","We\u2019re not in a position to talk to anything like new categories or new products. I think that\u2019s important that we respect our customer\u2019s position and anything that they might be launching we think should be coming from them.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thank you very much.","John Morikis","Thanks, Rosemarie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","Ivan Marcuse","Hi thanks. Just a real quick question in terms of 2015 the way I understand mix was a bit of a drag in terms of higher commercial volumes and lower protective and marine. 2016 within your sales guidance is mix, do we lapped that mix become sort of de-minimis or is that still a bit of an issue as commercial continues to grow and in the fact that continues to be a bit of a drag?","Bob Wells","I think that it's going to be smaller than it was this year, but it still will be somewhat of a drag.","Ivan Marcuse","Great, thanks.","John Morikis","Thanks, Ivan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jay McCanless, Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Jay McCanless","Good morning, everyone.","John Morikis","Good morning, Jay.","Jay McCanless","I've heard you all make some comments about SG&A, but did you provide formal guidance on what we should expect for SG&A as a percentage of sales for 2016?","John Morikis","No. We're basically giving you sales and EPS guidance. We didn't go down the factors of that.","Jay McCanless","Okay, all right. Thank you. ","John Morikis","Thanks Jay. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard","Good morning. ","John Morikis","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Bosshard","The store comp in 2015 moved around more than we're used to seeing from an 8 or 9 to a 2 and now back to a 5. The question in terms of 2016, the factors that moved it around during 2015, can you just remind us of what those were and then how you think about that as it relates to 2016? ","Bob Wells","Yes, I think that one of the first thing and as John said that you won\u2019t repeat it. We usually did not talk about weather, but weather did impact that second and third and I believe the fourth quarter. We had some nice weather and I think that homebuilders have said that they caught up more than they thought they were going to in the fourth quarter and I think that's probably a very accurate statement. And I think that we're not expecting, we probably expecting a little more normal in that area. I would say that's probably the big driver. The second one is probably the labor and how the labor was working and I think John's comment earlier that our customers seem to feel that they are in a better situation with labor going into 2016 than 2015.","Eric Bosshard","So I know you don't guide on a segment basis, but when you go through that it sounds like if more normal weather and more normal labor that I guess and your guidance wouldn't seem to imply that we're going back to 8s or 9s in the stores group. And so in terms of again the difference between what you are guiding in 2016 and the days of the 8s again what's the difference? ","Bob Wells","I would just say market.","John Morikis","And if you go back five years price too. Price in a lot of those years.","Bob Wells","Yes.","John Morikis","And as long as raw materials are benign, you are unlikely to see a lot of price. ","Bob Wells","Yes.","Eric Bosshard","Very good. Thank you.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Eric.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Well, now for sure, good afternoon, gentlemen. Very much for being so accommodating just a couple clarifications on the fourth quarter just make sure I understand the direction that the business is going. It sound like a Latin America, you saw a little bit faster volume declines. And I mean you complain about volumes being down offset by a higher pricing for a few quarters. But it looks like it was sort of way down in the fourth quarter. Is that sort of the pace of that we should expect to see there in 2016 in other words kind of a mid-single digit decline in organic growth of volume plus price?","Bob Wells","I will just tell you right now, Demetri, you are right. We don\u2019t break this out. We didn't see that dramatic of the difference between the fourth quarter and the other quarters in the year. By country, you saw different things go back and forth. I would say it was the dramatic change in the Brazilian real and some of these things that hit us harder than what we thought they were going to be in the fourth quarter. And when you sit there and take a look at that we have to get some price back, back to the comments about where we are. So I think things are from when you sit down and look at that gallon number and the sales number, I think it had more to do with FX than it did for business.","John Morikis","Yes, I would say that the one area that we clearly felt an impact, Dmitry was in that oil and gas and mining operations. We have a very good presence there and there's a lot of pressure there.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Got you, got you, okay. Just question book keeping question for Sean, the tax rate expectations for 2016 about 32% same as 2015.","Sean Hennessy","Yes. I think that \u2013 we've been in that range for probably 8 years to 10 years. And I could see us staying in that range. ","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay, very good. And then just on sort of the incremental margin and I know it's not the right way calculating. But I mean you've delivered like a 73% incremental margin in paint stores if you look at the change in revenue versus the change in profit dollars and as in the EBIT line and about 55% in the Consumer Group. Would lead me believe that a lot of your raw material benefit happened in the fourth quarter because I don't think your incremental margin really is that high, is that the right way to think about that? ","John Morikis","Yes, because if you think only about fourth quarter, gross margin it really came down to two things. Gross margin in SG&A and gross margin definitely had the larger impact in that SG&A. But don't discount that what we've been talking about with this Comex integration. I think that when you think about the expenses that were admin expenses, those kind of expenses we basically now at a nice run rate for all the different systems and admin expenses for Comex. ","Dmitry Silversteyn","Got it. One final question just on new store growth, you keep guiding to sort of the 100 stores a year or so. You get close in 2014 at about 95, you only get 3 this year. So what's holding you back from getting to that 100? Is it finding the right locations or some constraints on personal or sort of how should we think about your not exceeding 100 stores if you have 100 stores as a yearly average.","John Morikis","It really does come down to a level of comfort that we have with the expansion and making sure that we have the human talent to be able to deliver on our promise. And so as we add the stores incrementally important if you will to have the right people at the right level to be able to deliver on every brand promise that we make. And we just feel that 85 to 100 range is the right range and you're going to see that fluctuate, sometimes it just in the timing of when they are going to hit. You might have a heavier first quarter or heavier fourth quarter, but that's a range that we just feel comfortable with.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.","John Morikis","Thanks, Dmitry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Perrella","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my call. A real quick one, are you still taking 1% to 2% of Ti02 out of the formulations per annum or have you sort of had a technical limit with reductions.","John Morikis","Yes. I think there's a lot of discussion about the formulation a couple years ago and the reaction for the rapid rise in titanium dioxide. But we said then that a lot of our formulation for depending contractor. And we know that 1% to 2% was put up there by some of the competitors we have and we said that we're pretty careful not to change the formulas of these were of courses in the products.","Bob Wells","Yes, I like to make sure. We\u2019re very clear on that. The consistent for our product to our customers, we describe at this way, the closer than close enough for our customers. So we have had the opportunity to formulate for robustness that might modify the amount of Ti02 but the quality of our product is something that we will never ever put at risk. I mean the customers that come to buy our products are expecting a consistent product. Ti02 is a important part of that and the formulations that we've been able to help maximize the productivity by formulations is not at the cost of just simply removing Ti02 and having product that's going to perform differently.","Christopher Perrella","All right. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.","John Morikis","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Wong with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","David Wong","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. With the decline of raw materials in mid-single digit last year, presumably your competitors also benefited from that, have you started to feel any competitive pressures from your customers savings.","Sean Hennessy","We typically see the pressure on large bid projects and that's typically been the same for as long as I've been in the industry of 31 years. And while the average pricing might tick down slightly the margins are not. And so we worked very hard to ensure that we remain competitive on those large projects. It's a relatively small percentage of our total sales. They are good projects. They are often times, they are important projects to us and so we work to keep those projects Sherwin-Williams. ","David Wong","Great. And you guys said res repaint double-digits with DIY little bit slower, how did new res fair for you guys.","Sean Hennessy","New res was a good performer for us. It was slightly behind res repaint, but it performed well for us. We\u2019ve got have a very good relationship with many of the home builders in the marketplace and we have products that perform specifically for their needs. As well as what Bob mentioned we've got a distribution platform that allows us to make commitments across the country and be responsive to their needs. ","David Wong","Great, thank you.","John Morikis","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi, thanks very much. ","John Morikis","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas","Do you think that the weakness in oil and gas and in the southern and southwestern domestic economies is lowering your paint store volume growth rate by a pointer to and in general are Global Finishes volumes growing? Do you expect them to grow in the first half of 2016 and do you feel any slowing in domestic economy or in the global economy?","Sean Hennessy","I will take the Global Finishes first. We had a positive accounts in the Global Finishes North America was our strongest continent by far in total those were fine. When we look at \u2013 We don't break this out but I would tell you that I think your first question about when you have so many stores you got to be careful but it does appear that some of the weakness is starting is starting to affect some of the store sales in pockets. You go out to West Texas or some of these other places Oklahoma. I think we're starting to see it Jeff. ","Jeff Zekauskas","Yes. And then \u2013 go ahead, I\u2019m sorry.","Bob Wells","Well, I was going to say were starting to feel it in areas and yet construction in Texas in many parts of the states are still hanging on so it's a bit of a mixed bag. It offers opportunities. We are seeking them out.","Jeff Zekauskas","So domestic retail sales have slowed in the U.S. does you feel that or when you look at your order pattern or what your organization says does it feel like the U.S. is slowing down a little bit but that's not something you detect?","Bob Wells","When you take a look for us and I'll go to the store side the store side it's 85% painting contractors. The retail side is pretty \u2013 when you segment the retail you\u2019ll look at the people that we're selling in our retail stores I think we have probably not felt that it as strong as probably others. On the Lowe's side as I mentioned to a prior question is result incremental for us. We probably have a better picture down the road for you but I don't think we should be \u2013 I don\u2019t think we are the indicator for you.","Sean Hennessy","And Jeff a lot of the survey work I've read has indicated that home-improvement have actually held up better as a retail category than retail in general. So I think there has been an impact on home-improvement but it's been less than on other retail categories.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Bob Wells ","Thanks, Jeff. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you, gentlemen.","Bob Wells","Hi, Richard.","Richard O'Reilly","I\u2019ve got two questions. One I wanted to follow up on the finishes group. You just said you had positive volumes. Now oil and gas Protective and Marine were down, what areas were up for you? ","Bob Wells","We also have finish in their. We have some other businesses but I don't know if we want to cut it down to that kind of segment inside that Global Finishes Group.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay you did have positive volume growth in 2015. ","Bob Wells","Yes.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay. Second I want to follow-up on the raw materials your first question you said your projection of down mid-single digit seems conservative. And I know you talked about the Ti02 but propylene is down 50% in a year or so, so can you talk about the basket of your inputs and maybe give us an idea of why it's only down in mid-single digits. You understand that.","Sean Hennessy","Richard actually a mid-single-digit decline is a pretty significant decline across the entire basket. We spent a lot of time talking about Ti02 in the latex and Resin side of the basket which granted is the lion's share of our raw material basket by value but there are also categories of packaging and specialty chemicals that maybe moving the opposite direction. And offset the deflation in Ti02 and resins and latex to some degree.","The other thing I would caution you want is assuming that Resin and latex pricing is tracking in line with propylene or with crude oil a lot of times because these are specialty formulas they are often times owned and controlled by our supplier. That gives them some measure of pricing power in the short-term. The Resin that you use in a particular paint formula has a very significant impact on the performance of the end product and they're not interchangeable parts. If the supplier wants to hold on to some of the benefit of lower cost propylene for a period of time in the long run we believe we'll get the benefit but the benefit tends to come to market slower than in the commodity category like Ti02. ","Richard O'Reilly","Okay, good. Thank you for that answer. I appreciate it. That\u2019s it.","Bob Wells","Thanks, Richard.","Operator","Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. So I'd like to turn the fall back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.","Bob Wells ","Thanks again, Jessy. I'll conclude the call this morning by asking you to save the date of Thursday, May 26 on your calendars. That's the day we'll host our annual financial community presentation at our headquarters in Cleveland. The program will consist of our customary mourning presentations by management with a Q&A session followed by reception and lunch and then will also be some special program options offered in the afternoon to help commemorate our 150th year history.

In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, July 21 Press Release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the second quarter 2016 compared to the second quarter 2015, then comment on each reportable segment.","Consolidated net sales increased 2.8% to a record $3.22 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 1.5% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $105.8 million in the quarter to $1.64 billion.","Our consolidated gross margin increased 200 basis points in the quarter to 50.8% of sales from 48.8% in the second quarter last year. More than half of the gross margin improvement in the quarter resulted from the positive mix effect of Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, outpacing the growth of the other segments, coupled with increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume.","Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $54.7 million over second quarter last year to $1.1 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.7% in the second quarter this year, from 31.9% last year. A relatively small portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses.","Interest expense increased $28 million compared to second quarter last year to $40.9 million. This increase includes $20.7 million in acquisition-related interest expense with the balance resulting from a shift to long-term debt from short-term that occurred mid-year 2015.","Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $31.4 million to $539.2 million, due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $3.3 million compared to second quarter last year.","Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32.1%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard. For the full-year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the low 30%s, excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard.","Consolidated net income increased $28.1 million to $378.1 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 11.7% compared to 11.2% in the second quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 7.8% to $3.99 per share from $3.70 per share in 2015. The $3.99 includes $0.09 accretion from the accounting change and $0.16 dilution from acquisition-related expenses.","Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the second quarter 2016 increased 6.2% to $2.11 billion from $1.98 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.2%. All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic architectural paint and equipment sales volumes across all end markets. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter and Protective & Marine coating sales were a modest drag on revenue growth.","Regionally in the second quarter, our Southeastern division led all divisions, followed by Midwestern division, Southwestern division, Canada and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every geographic division.","Segment profit for the group increased $75.6 million, or 17.4% to $509 million in the quarter, as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 24.1% of sales from 21.8% in the second quarter last year.","For our Latin America Coatings Group, second quarter net sales stated in U.S. dollars decreased 11.2% to $133.3 million, due to unfavorable currency translation and negative volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 16.4% in the quarter.","Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to a loss of $9.6 million in the quarter from a profit of $4 million last year. Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation that were partially offset by selling price increases.","Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit $1.3 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was negative 7.2% in the quarter compared to a profit of 2.7% in the second quarter 2015.","Turning to the Consumer Group, second quarter sales decreased 2.6% to $477.5 million. As a reminder, in April, we annualized the completion of the load-in of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program in Lowe's stores, which was completed by May 1 last year.","Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $6 million to $108.3 million in the quarter from $114.2 million in the second quarter last year, due primarily to lower sales and increased SG&A spending, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies. Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 22.7% from 23.3% in the same period last year.","For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 1.3% to $499.2 million in the quarter, as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 2.6% in the quarter.","Second quarter segment profit stated in U.S. dollars increased $8 million, or 13.9% to $65.2 million, due primarily to decreasing raw material costs and good cost control, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which decreased segment profit $1.5 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the same period last year.","That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So, I will now turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for third quarter and full-year. John?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I think it's fair to say our results for the second quarter were mixed. Architectural paint volumes through our Paint Stores Group held up well in the quarter, resulting in solid revenue growth and continued strong earnings leverage and flow-through.","Our Global Finishes Group also did a commendable job of managing both gross margins and SG&A, resulting in a respectable 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest volume growth.","We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and the U.S., and currency headwinds in Latin America are starting to ease. Those were the positives in the quarter.","On the other hand, while we expected difficult comparisons in the HGTV HOME paint program due to heavy stocking orders in the second quarter last year, some of the retail programs we thought would generate growth in the quarter fell short. We are supporting many of these programs with incremental SG&A investment and we have high return expectations on these investments. Finally, while currency comparisons have improved in many Latin American countries, demand trends remain difficult and our outlook for this segment for the full-year continues to deteriorate.","Our earnings per share results in the quarter include expenses related to the Valspar acquisition as well as a tax benefit related to the adoption of a new accounting standard. If you back out these items, diluted net income per common share increased 9.7% on sales growth of less than 3%. As a percent of sales, gross profit increased 200 basis points year-over-year and operating profit and profit before tax, both expanded a little more than 50 basis points.","Excluding the acquisition expense, our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was 36%. SG&A was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way as a percent of sales. The result of higher SG&A spending by Paint Stores Group, channel investment by Consumer Group and expenses related to the Valspar acquisition.","Paint Stores Group delivered another strong sales performance in the residential segments, which includes residential repaint contractors, new residential construction and DIY. Combined, sales to these three segments grew by more than 10%. Sales to commercial, healthcare and property management customers also generated solid year-over-year growth. The outlook for continued growth in these segments over the balance of the year remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor segments, extending into 2017.","During the first half of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 45 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations. This completes our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the full-year still calls for store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,117 compared to 4,025 a year ago.","We anticipated a modest sales decline from Consumer Group coming into the second quarter. This, combined with the elevated SG&A investment tempered our second quarter outlook which is reflected in our guidance. We remain confident that the great work our Consumer Group teams are doing in strengthening our brand positioning across all retail channels and the investment we are making in many of these channels will pay handsome returns in the years ahead. Consumer Group's commercial, industrial and MRO business continue to show good progress on both sales and margin in the quarter.","Unfavorable currency translation continues to weigh on sales and profit performance in our Global Finishes Group and Latin America Coatings Group. Both segments reported positive sales in local currency in the quarter and Global Finishes Group volumes were positive, thanks in large part to improving market conditions in North America and Europe.","Volume sales in most Latin American countries continue to decline with Brazil standing out as the most notable exception. Although Brazil's volume momentum improved in the quarter, margin pressure from raw materials continue to challenge profitability in Brazil and throughout the region. In the first six months of 2016, we generated $510 million in net operating cash, an increase of $161 million compared to the first half of 2015, driven by higher six-month net income and good working capital discipline.","Working capital was a use of cash in the quarter, increasing by about $3.8 million year-over-year. Working capital as a percent of sales decreased to 11.6% from 11.8% at the end of the second quarter last year. Our capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $62.1 million. Depreciation was $43.8 million and amortization was $6.2 million.","In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects.","During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On June 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016.","At the close of the second quarter 2016, our cash balance was $402.7 million compared to $75.1 million on June 30, 2015. Yesterday, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year.","The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the next six months remains very positive, and we should see steady improvement from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset, to some degree, by continued weakness in Latin America. As we've commented over the past few quarters, the gross margin tailwind we have enjoyed in recent years from raw material cost deflation will diminish, as we go through the back-half of 2016.","Our outlook for third quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase low to mid-single digits percent compared to last year's third quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share compared to last year's record $3.97 per share.","The full-year 2016 earnings per share guidance we provided at the end of the first quarter did not include expenses related to the acquisition of Valspar or the tax benefit from the adoption of the new accounting standard. Today, we are revising our guidance for full-year consolidated net income per common share to reflect these two impacts.","For the full-year, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2015 by a low-single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are revising our expectations for full-year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.65 to $11.85 per share compared to $11.16 per share earned in 2015.","Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And, now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we would be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much. Could you just comment on your performance in the DIY channel specifically at the home centers? And how HGTV trended versus Infinity inventories? And then also whether or not you believe there is a large inventory \u2013 or excuse me, a pull forward from March as well? Thank you.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think that there was a large pull forward in the first quarter. I'd say that our performance in the second quarter, we feel as though inside our largest customer with Lowe's that we're continuing to gain momentum as far as the performance in the market, I think we're going to let them comment on how their performance rated against the market.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. And just a quick follow-up. You outlined a few trends in LatAm and indicated you still expect some continued weakness. But can you offer a little more color on what you're seeing here and whether or not you believe you've reached an inflection point in terms of the magnitude of operating losses? Thank you.","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, I think that last year we earned positive profit in each one of the quarters last year. And for the year, we think that this year is going to be the exact opposite. But I do think when you look at the investments we're making, we think we're doing the right long-term and we think that the markets are troughing.","I think that when you look at specifically at Mexico and Brazil, we're closer to the end. What we said last year, we felt that Brazil, you wouldn't see an improvement during 2016, maybe mid-2017. I don't think we've seen much difference there with political and so forth.","In Mexico, we think Mexico is doing better. We think that's doing fine, but Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, we're still having some headwinds there and so we do believe that for the year we're going to lose money in Latin America.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But as we've spoken in the past, we feel this is an opportunity for us. We see rather than just waiting for the market to correct, and we do think that the market will improve, that there are some steps that we can be taking and we're taking those steps, and ensuring that we've got the right products, the right channels and the right people in those markets and we're making very good progress in the improvements down there. So, as the market does improve, we expect to outperform the market.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's great detail. Thank you very much.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good morning. First off on the 5.2% same store sales increase that you reported during the quarter, did that come in basically where you thought it would come \u2013 where you thought it would heading into the quarter? And in terms of the outlook, do you sense any change in industry fundamentals either in residential or commercial construction, or any particular region within the U.S.? Thanks.","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","This is Sean Hennessy. And the 5.2% is fairly close to where we were. We have said that in the first quarter that was tremendously strong. We're almost double digits in the comp store, so we did feel that it was going to be lower than that first quarter, but the 5.2% in that materially different than what we had in the guidance.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And regarding the market, Ghansham, I'd say it's been great deal of my time with our customers and with our people in this segment, and there's a strong sense of bullishness in this area. There's continued growth in the residential repaint area. This is yet another quarter for us with double-digit gains in residential repaint. Our commercial customers are really speaking of a very solid book that currently exists, as well as a number of bids in the pipeline. So, on the architectural side, we're really excited about this market.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And just my second question, in terms of the \u2013 maybe you can share the raw material costs including titanium dioxide and inflation more broadly including labor inflation from the back half of 2016 and heading into 2017. I guess I'm asking because the industry has not seen a paint price increase since 2013, it seems like the case is increasing for one in 2017, would you sort of agree with that?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Yes, Ghansham, this is Bob. On the raw material outlook, we still see low mid-single-digit deflation for the full-year 2016. Although, you asked specifically about TiO2. The majors in TiO2 we think are probably gaining some traction on the second quarter price increase that they announced, that is off to December 2015 lows.","The implementation at this point as near as we can tell from an industry standpoint is probably in the mid-single-digit cents per pound, so not a significant increase in percentage terms. As expected, they've been out with a third quarter announcement. We think that it's likely they may get some traction, but how much they get really depends on customer size, on location geographically.","So, we're likely to see some year-over-year inflation in TiO2 as far as the rest as the basket. The feed stocks for the latex and acrylic monomer market have been very stable. Chemical grade propylene has been steady at around $0.31 a pound. So we don't necessarily see inflation in that side of the basket.","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And on the labor side, we're putting our game plans together for 2017. We've done a lot of work on 2017. But we don't see \u2013 in our guidance, we still see productivity gains, especially in the Stores Group. So, when you look at that labor expense \u2013 and we're evaluating 2017, as we go.","And as always, before we announce in the market what we're going to do with pricing, we would talk to our customers first. So, those plans are being developed right now. And if we do go, after we've talked to the customers, we'll be pretty transparent and let you know.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Ghansham.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. When you look across the paint industry in United States and you compare the performance of company-owned stores, whether it's yours or those of other companies, to the amount of paint that's going through the big box retailers or through channels that are non-company-owned stores, do you see differences in volume growth or are they comparable?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think, when you look at the results, I think, it's showing up, Jeff, that the painting contractor is the faster growing \u2013 that the painting contractor is growing faster than DIY. I think that's our perception, and I think the facts bear that out.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And is there a different conduct of the big box retailers toward inventories; that is, are they taking steps to meaningfully push down their inventories either temporarily or permanently?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think that our customers have always done a very good job in managing their working capital, and we're constantly working with them. We want to have the right inventory on the shelf, Jeff. And there are times when that means that they're little lighter in some areas and a little more in others.","And so I'd say it's just an ongoing discussion that we have with our customers. We want to help drive their key metrics cumulatively or any others that they have. And so, as they are reviewing what it is that's working for them, we want to be a part of that.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, fellas. Question just on the raw materials again. For Global Finishes, you called out that raw materials was down and a benefit for LatAm that was up and a headwind, what's the dichotomy going on there?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think that Latin America 100% of the raw materials are based on U.S. dollar and it's fully affected by the currency changes. In the Global Finishes, we do have a portion of that business that's in the United States that doesn't have that same effect and I think that's what \u2013 that's really the dramatic difference there.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. In the 2016 since you called out on the acquisition cost, what was that pre-tax and where did that roll through the P&L?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. 100% of it went through the admin section. It was $25.2 million pre-tax which we broke down to $15.4 million after-tax, which gave $0.16. $4.5 million approximately went through SG&A, the other $21 million went through the interest expense. And again, that was 100% in the administrative segment.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, fellas.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Duffy.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Morning, thanks. Just a question on the same stores, I think you do both Protective & Marine in there, so is that a fair assumption that your architectural sales were above that 5.2% and maybe you can just gauge what kind of range your Protective & Marine was tracking in the quarter?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Your first part of the question and sort of your implication is exactly right. Architectural was the fastest growing and the Protective & Marine was dampened. Really don't have a metric that I think we can share with you that we'd be comfortable with.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But I would say this, Arun, is that, all along as we've been going through this, just as we just talked about Latin America, there are a number of segments within the Protective & Marine opportunities for our company. And so while we've been experiencing some pressure in oil and gas, the teams are pivoting and really focused on other segments that offer opportunities in both sales and margin.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. And just similarly on those points, though, would you say that both in Latin America and in Protective & Marine you're nearing kind of a bottom in those comps and is your guidance kind of embed and using in those comps through the year?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think so. Yeah, I think as we move forward, the comps \u2013 we're going to lap those comps. And at the same time, some of the good work our teams \u2013 what they're putting in place right now will continue to, I think positively benefit us going forward.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I think that even though the comps are getting easier, we're basically saying I think that we're in a trough now. I don't think we're ready to say that we're going to see some major growth in either the Latin America or the Protective & Marine, but I think we're in a trough.","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","In the oil and gas.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then, just last question, you had put out earlier that your belief is that you can potentially get to 820 million gallons in the next peak, is that still your belief and when do you think you can get there in that cycle? Thanks.","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It is, Arun. And we base that belief on the fact that the install base of square footage that requires maintenance has grown pretty dramatically since we considered mid-700 million gallons to be normalized. So this peak should be well above the last peak just at normal build rates and we're not back to normal build rates yet. We consider normal to be closer to 1.4 million, 1.5 million residential starts and a little stronger non-res activity than we're seeing right now.","So, once we get build rates back there and once the maintenance cycles have returned to kind of normalized repaint activity, we think we're going to see normalized volume in the 780 million to 810 million gallons and very likely that this cycle should peak above that 810 million gallons. Whether that takes three years or five years to get back to, time will tell, as the rate of recovery in the residential market right now, I think, that is probably going to take at least three years to get back there.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Thanks.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Scott.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning. So, I just wanted to \u2013 a little longer-term oriented question, just trying to understand, your gross margin obviously up nice in the quarter and gross margins been coming up quite a bit. Obviously, raw material cost has something to do with that. But as you guys look at kind of like your normalized gross margins, what are your thoughts about that? Can we still see things come up here and \u2013 I just wanted to get your thoughts on that?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I think that the way we run the business, we believe that in the long-term, we're going to continue to raise the ROS. I think that the gross margin, we've had great expansion. And basically because of three things \u2013 really nice gallon growth especially in the Stores Group, an integration that is complete now from the Comex North America, and raw materials have been a tailwind but those things have occurred.","I think that in all cases, we're always looking long-term. I like your term \u2013 really looking in the long-term. And again this year, we're taking a balanced approach to where we're going. We're investing. There is times when the gross margin will lead our ROS improvements. And there is times that SG&A \u2013 and in fact that gallon growth that we've had in the Stores Group is because of innovation. I think that we continue to do a lot of innovation, and innovation has helped us in all the different segments.","So when you look at where we're going this year, our mid-point of our range is $12.60; last year was $11.13 \u2013 a 13% increase \u2013 and then when you take a look at a challenging global environment and no share buybacks. Our original guidance had approximately $0.25 worth of buybacks in there.","So, we're generating net operating cash at record levels, and we're continuing to make prudent investments in the business. So, you're going to see SG&A probably this year isn't going to be in the improvement in the ROS, it has to be in gross margin. And we had the tailwind. We've clearly said there wasn't going to be a tailwind. We had the innovation. We had Stores Group going away. But we're pretty confident that those investments will earn solid returns in the future, and that's how we do this balanced approach for the long-term that you asked.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","That's perfect. I appreciate all the color. And just maybe switching gears just a little bit to capacity levels that you guys are seeing right now, one of these \u2013 where are they and what will they look like if you successfully close the Valspar acquisition?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We always have said that we were \u2013 88% to 92% is the sweet spot for us. And 2008 and 2009, when the market did go down 25%, 30% in that one year, we managed it. We did not take all the capacity out to get down to that level. And that's where the earlier question about the 820 million gallons, we were shooting for that 750 million gallons, 770 million gallons. So that capacity \u2013 we live with the capacity in the low 70%. We're now much closer to that 88% to 92%, and that's why our margins are doing very well.","Since then, that North America acquisition of Comex \u2013 I think those gallons going into our footprint, but we've hung onto a couple of the assets they have and when we look at the Valspar, we think that they have some great assets to give us for capacity. We think that gives us another leg in the stool that give us the ability to have that capacity utilization go down in the short-term, but then gives us the ability to grow without a great deal of CapEx.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","All right, awesome. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Just to dig in a little bit more in Consumer Group, you mentioned a couple of programs you were running at retail that didn't get the traction that you were looking for and you obviously have some increased spending against that. So, what is just sort broadly or specifically, what's the course correction that you're looking to do and is it something that you can do this year or is it something that we have to wait until next paint season to see the results of?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think what's important here is that there is some investment here and we see as the clear opportunity. We do go into this with our eyes wide open. We know that there are investments made that may not come back in the first quarter that we make those investments, maybe not the second. But if you look at our market share in this segment, there's terrific opportunities, we believe a disciplined approach and aggressive approach here can help us to grow our market share and manage our margins for our shareholders. So, we're moving in this direction with a very disciplined look. We're making the investments and we think that there are opportunities out there for us to grow.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","And...","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And just as a \u2013 go ahead, sorry, Bob.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Yeah and as far as the timing as you mentioned, we're patient. We think \u2013 but we don't see it snapping back in the next quarter or so.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay and just as a follow-up, you mentioned Consumer Group should improve sequentially through the balance of the year; but, I mean, should we be modeling 3Q still flat to down, or how should we be thinking about that on the top-line?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","You know on the top-line, I think, as we settle sequentially, we'll improve I think that; but, you know, with some of the situations we just talked about, we think it's going to be flat to up slightly.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Vincent.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes, thank you. Question first just on your overall impression in the architectural market, you know, last year was obviously \u2013 I know, you don't like to talk about weather, but it was weather depressed and growth was 2% to 3%, are you seeing the snapback you expected this year or has that been moderated again by weather? Bob, what's kind of your outlook for the U.S. architectural market growth this year?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Yeah, Don. For starters, we don't think there was much of a weather effect in the numbers this year. We think that build rates are holding up very well, but they're not on fire. Residential construction is up about 10% year-over-year in square footage terms.","In the commercial markets, starts are down but completions are up pretty significantly year-over-year. So we're seeing solid demand growth in the new construction market. In the repaint market, while the pro-residential repaint business has been really solid, what's hard to determine at this stage, because we just don't have the data is how the DIY channels held up in the second quarter. So, I hesitate to say, that there's just not enough data to call market growth in the second quarter yet, but I think that's the truth. The contractor market seems to have grown nicely, but it's hard to tell on the other piece.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And, John, a question, maybe you can update us on Valspar synergy outlook, to the extent you've been able to talk to your counterparts over there and have meetings about combining the two companies. What's your updated outlook for synergy potential or as \u2013 what's your updated confidence level in the original target you set out?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. I don't think we're going to move the original target and \u2013 but I think that as time goes on, we continue to feel very confident that we're going to hit those numbers.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Don.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Mike.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could give a little more detail on the solid margin performance you had in the Global Finishes Group? I know you mentioned the price and mix was improving. What exactly was driving that and how sustainable could a number like 13% margin be as we get into the second half in that segment?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","I think that when we take a look at that group I think that the improvement stems from really four focused driving that product technology I mentioned earlier into the market, improving SG&A, capturing pricing in the \u2013 where to offset currency and then capturing reductions in the raw materials that they occur in the United States.","So, these combination of four things I don't think are going to change. You'll see the slide. For the longest time, we used to talk about 12% and I think that this has given us great confidence that we can say 13%. And with some market share gains, I think, we can actually beat that number. So, I think the game plan has worked very, very well.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Great. And then a question on Latin America. You'd sounded like you mentioned that you expect to be below breakeven for the rest of the year. But just wondering, as we get into the heavier paint season there in Q4, is there a chance that we get north of breakeven? And also wondering if there was some unusual costs in Q2 that help explain a pretty significant sequential weakening in terms of the earnings in Latin America? Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","The answer to the last question is, no, there really was no one-time thing that I would point out. I just think it was the operation as it is. I think we come closer to breakeven and maybe there is a chance that if we have a little stronger sales \u2013 the fourth quarter definitely is the closest to breakeven for the remainder of the year. But right now, I would not come out here and say we're definitely going to make money in the fourth quarter.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Two questions. One was accounting and charge clarification and then second on the business. Sean, the income tax benefit \u2013 could you explain what that actually is? And is it just simply as straight as $0.09, $8 million is coming into taxes?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. And what that is, is when we've expensed \u2013 when starting the new rules many, many years ago, expensing stock option, RSO grant and so forth, you charge the P&L for the Black Scholes amount. So, whatever the Black Scholes value was on the day of the issuance, basically, you straight line to a three-year or a five-year option vesting period.","Then what would occur is, if the stock \u2013 the differential between when the day of vesting, a differential between the Black Scholes value and the actual value was actually that difference would use to go to retained earnings. We always took it on our tax return, and that was one of the differentials between book and cash taxes.","So this change, this accounting change for us has nothing to do with and won't change our cash performance; but instead of having that differential for us as you said in the second quarter, $8 million go to retained earnings and now goes directly through the P&L. So that's why it was $0.09 in the second quarter. Year-to-date, it was $0.28 and the reason why it was $0.19 in the first quarter is because of the \u2013 in the first quarter when the vesting occurred of our long-term RSOs, so that many people around that, so that's why it hit in the first quarter, second quarter was really driven by stock options that were exercised. So, that's what it is. It does have a cash differential that's why we pointed it out. We adopted it this quarter, so we can do it the accounting this way. I think as time goes on, I think January everyone has to go on it, so I think what we took the opportunity to do it now just to get this noise out of our P&L next year.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","And so we should see something else in the next two quarters?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","More like the second quarter not the first quarter?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right. And just so you know when we try to say, we guesstimated that number will be $0.45 for the year. So, when we were talking about when we show that schedule in the back, that's where that $0.45 comes from. So 2017, we're seeing 2017 in the next two quarters, so $0.085 a quarter or something in that range.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","Thank you. That's a great catch up. So, then back to the more fun stuff, John, I guess, what will be helpful is understanding through the quarter I think there were a couple questions that sort of tease it out, if I remember last year we had a wet June and that may have had some impact, would you say that the business was quite steady in Paint Stores Group through the quarter or was there strengthening or weakening or how would you put that together?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd say, it was pretty steady if you compare apples-to-apples, Greg, the performance inside stores still go in the right direction but consistent throughout the quarter.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","Okay. Got it. And I think in the prepared comments you mentioned that in Consumer, what was weaker than expected was other retail programs. I think I got \u2013 I hope I wrote that down right. Explain to us what that is, is that other architectural paint programs or is it some of the spray paints or sealants or give us a little more color on that would be helpful?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Those are few things that we're working on, Greg and quite frankly, we prefer that our customers start talking about that when the timing is right. We're leaning forward in that area. And as I mentioned and it is important in a very disciplined fashion. We didn't feel as though that the return would come back in the first quarter.","Sales-wise, we have high expectations for ourselves and we're going to continue to push to grow our sales. We have a high regard for our team there and they're pursuing some opportunities with customers in a number of different channels and in a number of different segments and spaces. So, it's not one but a number of areas that we are investing in and believe that we can grow.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","But it specifically wasn't the HGTV that cycling the sale in last year, that was on plan?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's correct.","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","All right. Thanks. Good luck.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah. Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. First is on non-res starts, as Bob, I think you said completions have been good this year so that's obviously helping your business. But starts themselves have been down meaningfully in the first part of this year. Does that mean that there's going to be a fairly significant headwind next year and what you do to sort of get ahead of that?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Yeah, Nils, on average, as we typically point out, the time between starts and completion runs about 20 months to 22 months in the non-residential space, which means that next year we're primarily going to be completing 2015 starts. 2015 was a pretty strong year. Not as strong as 2014. 2014 was the strongest year since the recession.","2015 was the second strongest and today so far year-to-date we're running down about 9% in square footage of starts. So, we will see the non-residential market trend downward in terms of completions over the next couple of years. As a reminder, the non-res market you're talking about, a-third of the new construction piece of the market, which new construction totals less than 20%. So it will be a headwind in out years just not a real significant one.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. And then, at your recent Investor Day, you guys highlighted quite a bit of the innovation particularly Paint Shield, wondering how that's tracking and obviously there's back \u2013 tying into the non-res starts, there has been some quite a bit of strength in healthcare. So, wondering if you've been able to get in on the ground, so to speak.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'd say, with the new technology like this, as expected in this area that there will be a little bit of a ramp-up. We're working with a number of different decision makers and influencers in this area. Trend-wise, it's going in the right direction. And we're going to continue to focus on it. But the comparisons, as we go forward here, while we expect to continue to improve.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Understood. I'll pass it on.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Nils.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, can you give me the gross profit changes on the Paint Stores, Consumer and Global and Latin America? Give a chance.","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. Paint Stores Group was an increase of $116 million. Consumer was flat. Global Finishes was up $2.5 million, and Latin America was down $13 million.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And then in terms of the Paint Stores, the significant contribution margin has been pretty largely probably due to the volume leverage and outflow of raw materials. Does raw material sort of level out? Do you look for that contribution margin to sort of go back to the traditional 25%, 30% type of flow through to the bottom line, as you go through the back-half?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I think the 60%, 70% flow through are nice. But you're right. Not just that raw materials grew, we're fully integrated now with Comex. And those things have really helped us over the last two years, three years. So, yeah, we see as time goes on, we still have great flow through. But probably you're going to see it closer to maybe a little higher than what we've done in the past. But yes, it will.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then the last question. In terms of the acquisition-related costs, how much of \u2013 what are the big buckets that these costs are going into and how much of them are cash? And are they big enough where you're sort of getting ahead of what cost may be when the deal finally closes in the first quarter?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. In the first quarter, the acquisition cost \u2013 I'm going to just speak to PBT. I won't talk about it unless you want me to. But if you take a look at the big buckets, there were advisor fees there. And then another big piece of that niche, that's the cash-out in the third quarter because of the timing and so forth, but that plus the bridge and turmoil fees, we're amortizing those bridge and turmoil fees today, that's cash.","Then we have some legal fees that are cash, but the big hit will be Valspar's advisor and legal fees, which will occur at the close. So, when we look at that $0.72 that we show in the fourth quarter to finalize the 132, the majority of that is going to be a cash hit that's why a lot of times we look at the cash needed to close this $11.3 billion, we look at it closer to $11.5 billion because we have these $200 million worth of pre-tax closing costs in total. The majority of which will be paid back at that time.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you, Ivan.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good morning, everyone.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Most of my stuff has been covered already, but I want to go back to the Consumer segment. Just focusing on the segment rather than the customer, John, Sean and Bob, how would the sales change year-over-year look if you could take out the load in sales of a year ago?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It would be up slightly.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","So, 2%, 3% is that a good way to put it slightly?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","All right. Thank you.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Chuck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Hi. Good morning. Question for Sean, when you're referring to SG&A been elevated for the balance of the year, the 70 basis points of deleverage that we saw in 2Q, is that the run rate we should consider for the back half of the year?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think you're not going to be far off, it's not going to be exactly that, but that's probably not a bad number.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","And then when we think about the 70 basis points in 2Q, is that all Consumer or are there investments elsewhere that cause deleverage?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think the majority of which was in Consumer, but LACG \u2013 but we're still investing in stores. I think that the stores investments have not changed. We think this is a continued driver. So, the SG&A increase as a percent of sales was not in stores, but we still are investing in the stores as heavy as we ever have been.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Right. So just a tailored question, maybe the consumer \u2013 given that you had heavy investment last year and then you have heavy investment this year that might be related to other programs. Do you think this is needed to sustain that flat to low single-digit growth you guys have guided to longer-term? Or should we expect the growth rate to be better than that once you get a return on these investments?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're going to be trying to drive that higher, Scott. Investments that we're making here we believe can help us.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Hello and good morning, everyone.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","I guess it is still morning. I was just wondering if on the Global Finishes Group you could talk a little bit about the areas where you are seeing some improvement outside of oil and gas, which markets or which industries are actually growing?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Inside our Protective & Marine we're focused on a number of them. Rosemarie, I prefer not to highlight those for obvious reasons, but our teams are really pivoting into some areas where we've had some presence in the past, but we feel as though we could be more meaningful in the marketplace. And so we're investing in sales rep time and specification effort as well as some product development to help us.","So, as we're pursuing these segments we're \u2013 sometimes adversity brings out the best. We're finding that we have technologies that will help customers in adjacent segments. We have people that are knowledgeable and we can pursue better. So, we're after them. I'd rather not highlight them right now, but rest assured that we're out there and pursuing them.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","So when we look at the industrial world or the industrial market what you are seeing is, I am just making sure I understand, is that you don't want to talk about those particular areas which are actually doing better than what we read in the paper, for example?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's correct. And in some of the areas that we just have a lower share in the very profitable segments that we can increase our share in.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. And for Sean, if I look at that \u2013 the impact on the interest expense from the acquisition expenses. So, I am actually calculating that your regular interest expense is $20.2 million more or less. Is that the right number to look at for the balance of the year, until you are actually borrowing the full boat for the Valspar acquisition?","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes it is. We did borrow last year in July. And so, we've now fully anniversaried those bonds that we issued. So, we're 100% fixed right now because we're not in any variable interest. That's a very good rate. That $20 million is a very good number.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. And then lastly, if I may, and you may not want to respond to it, but anything new on the regulatory front regarding the Valspar acquisition.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I wouldn't say that there is anything new. We disclosed that we've received a second request, and we're working with the FTC to provide all the information that they need to complete their review. So, we're trying to be as responsive as we can to provide them with the information that they're asking for.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","And with that in mind, do you still expect to close at the end of the first quarter?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We still are anticipating closing in the first quarter, yes.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Rosemarie. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks, guys. Housing may not be at a peak again yet, but Cleveland certainly seems to be on a high right now.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Wait till October and the Indians in the World Series.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","There is a lot of questions on the call here about the sustainability of paint demand at these levels. On your pro customers, do you have insights into their backlogs? When you talk about them being bullish, do you think their backlogs or business are higher or just because there has been such a strong first half, they probably run off a fair amount of backlog that it would be hard for them to maintain the same level?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually, John, the discussions I've had with many customers around the country would say that they've got a good book of business that they're dealing with right now. They've got a good book of business that they have in the pipeline either secured or believe that they're going to secure. But what gives us, perhaps, most excitement is the pipeline of bids that they're looking at down the road. They also feel \u2013 that's why I mentioned earlier that they are bullish about those as well.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Are they buying spray equipment and ladders that would be supportive that they have a lot of confidence in their outlook?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","They are, yes. I'm going to say that we have strong equipment sales, as we pointed out in the first portion of our discussion.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Yep. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hello, everyone. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. Just in your 2016 guidance I was hoping you could give me a little more directionality or specificity on your same store sales number that you're implying?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that we've never broken out segment win inside our guidance but I think what we freely have said for probably 14 quarters in a row when you look at that guidance number, the Stores Group again will [lead our] sales in the third quarter and fourth quarter and for the full-year. So I think that the first half of the year is probably a pretty good indication of where you'd see, when you break out your sales in the model that Stores Group is going to be number one and those comp stores are going to be strong.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, John. And then another year you're expecting 90 to 110 net new stores, you put out some pretty good targets out there on 6,000. Can you just talk about sort of what gives you guys the confidence to say that you're not hitting or you won't hit a saturation point or some diminishing returns with that level of continued growth?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","I'd say we spend a lot of time on this metric. We've been watching to see how the new stores today are creating cash and the metrics versus the metrics we've done over the years. We compare it to the market. We compare it to how that market is in relative size to stores per household and the metrics have all been going in the right direction, which would tell you if your incremental stores continue to perform like that, you're probably \u2013 and the markets are performing that you're probably not at a saturation point.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Chris, we often cite that we're blessed with a number of very good competitors and there's plenty of opportunity out there for us to continue to grow and new stores is one channel for them.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then just one more really quick one with share repurchase side lines, decent amount of dilution in the quarter just kind of wondering, is that a reasonable run rate to expect as we go through the year or is that kind of unique to this quarter?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think it's pretty reasonable. I think when we look at what we think our share count will be in the fourth quarter because of that dilution it's slightly higher than in the second quarter. But I think your point is well taken, again, approximately $0.25 of our original guidance we came out of January with had share repurchase. So when you look at the share count if you go out to the fourth quarter and have a slightly higher number than the second quarter, I think you're in good shape.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks guys.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","John, I wanted to circle back, you had talked about steady sales kind of month-to-month in the quarter, and hearing pretty good things from the customers, the painters from the channel in terms of what's going on. Curious how we look at the comp of 9% in the first quarter and 5% in the second quarter and look at the guidance it implies, the 2Q comp is the right number through the rest of the year, something in that neighborhood, what's the difference between 1Q and 2Q?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the size of the number, obviously, when you look at the first quarter just the raw number versus the second has an impact on it, Eric and what I was speaking to as far as the comparisons month-to-month, we didn't see any significant highs and lows within the quarter that they were pretty consistent in our year-over-year comparisons.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And so the \u2013 and I understand the scale and the magnitude of the quarters can make \u2013 can sort of hide the impact or overstate a little bit the impact of growth, were there pieces of the business that just grew faster in 1Q than they grew in 2Q?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, not that I can think of. We have, again not to be too repetitive here, but we had a terrific quarter and then in residential repaint, double-digit gains. As talked about in the first portion of our comments about the whole residential, new residential DIY, all performing well and I don't know that there was any significant swings from the first quarter to second quarter.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. I'll circle back to get more detail. All right. Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thanks, Eric.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Wang with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just had two. First is, wanted to get a little bit more understanding on the margins. So overall incremental margins are around 36% with Paint Stores performing particularly well. Are we close to the sweet spot in your capacity utilization and if so, is there much operating leverage remaining as we ramp up to what your estimate for mid-cycle paint volumes would be, or is this going to be more of a headwind going forward where we wouldn't see as much incremental margin for new paint volumes?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Yeah, I think that we're getting closer to the sweet spot. I think that there is still some room when it comes to looking at that incremental margin. I think, when we were in the low-70%s, we had a great deal of room, and so you saw a greater impact. But I do think the incremental margins will still be strong. They will be higher than our ROS today.","And I think that's the key for us. We are always trying to make sure that our incremental margin \u2013 our incremental flow-through, as we call it, is greater than our current ROS. So I still see that happening. I just don't see it happening at the 60%, 70% incremental margins.","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We've got a terrific operating team that's constantly working to improve and unlock capacity in our facilities. And so that process continues. And we've got a wonderful team there that's working diligently to do that on a regular basis.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","So, currently we're not at the 80%, 90% or so utilization?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's true.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Great. And then a second question on normalized paint volumes. I think your new forecast for 780 million gallons to 110 million gallons is a bit higher than your prior forecast. I think what we discussed a few years ago was normalized volumes of around 760 million. That's probably closer to what we are at today.","And it looks like a large portion of the difference between your previous expectation and your new one is higher mid-cycle levels for res repaint and DIY. I know you guys discussed having a larger base of homes that would need repainting. But to the extent that the mid-cycle and new res forecast hasn't changed much, is it that we just expect the cycle to have a much bigger rally in the near-term before normalizing the mid-cycle or, I guess, what is driving the main difference?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Well, David, the question you're asking is why is what we consider normalized growing? And I think you answered the question. It's growing because the base is growing. And if you look at the overall U.S. architectural paint market, more than 80% of average annual volume goes toward repaint and it's applied to structures that already exist.","If you look at that 740 million to 760 million normalized range that dates all the way back to the late 1990s. And we've had three building cycles since the late 1990s that have put a lot more square footage in place. Our population has grown significantly since then. So, we think it's reasonable to adjust the normalized expectation up based on primarily repaint volume.","The other thing you see is, as the housing market continues to improve and get healthier and that health is oftentimes reflected in home values, you'll see the frequency of repaint activity increase. So at the peak of this cycle, people are painting more, just like they are remodeling more.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","All right. So, there will be no change to your estimates for, say, housing starts for the peak or normalized?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Well, no, for normalized that normalized band would assume housing starts in the range of 1.4 million to 1.5 million. We think that's sustainable given our current rate of household formation.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","All right. Great. Thank you.","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Lalli with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brian J. Lalli - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks for the time here late in the call, guys. I appreciate it. Just a quick question from the debt size and I apologize if I missed any prepared remarks in this but if could \u2013 could we get an update on the plans for, I guess, the longer term debt financing around the Valspar acquisition?","And then, secondly, as a follow-up to that, Moody's specifically had comments on the ratings front being at risk for downgrade potentially even out of investment grade depending on the structure. So if you could maybe just comment on your commitment to IG rating and how that might guide your financing decisions as we get closer to closing, that would be helpful? Thanks a lot.","Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","First of all, what we said and I don't have this in front of me, but I think I'm going to be very close. Bob can tell us on the financial community presentation that's now in the Sherwin.com under IR, so we have a schedule and I actually show you what we think our debt to EBITDA would be all the way out to I believe 2020.","So, I'd ask you to do that but I think what we try to show there is that the day of close our leverage is going to go over 6% if we close, and based on closing first quarter 2017 our debt to EBITDA would be over 4%, approximately 4.25%, and so by 2019 we'll be at 3% and by 2020 at 1.9% which is under 2%. And I think that's a big goal by 2020 to be under 1.9%.","What we said is, and I want to answer this way because immediately after that financial community presentation, we were asked, does this mean that you're not going to buy any stocks through 2020 and I said no, we are going to buy stock when our debt to EBIT starts to approach 2.5% to 1%. So that will give you a little picture of what we're thinking.","And then on the Moody's front, I think that we read the same thing from Moody's. Every summer after the second quarter we've always had an individual meeting with Moody's and Fitch and S&P. We did have a meeting prior to the announcement of the Valspar acquisition, which is some \u2013 and I think that we're going to go see all three of the rating agencies during this quarter and it's been \u2013 we're optimistic that we keep the investment-grade.","Investment-grade is very important to us because in the first quarter of every year our cash flow is negative, because we're building inventory for the season so we're in the commercial paper, we want to be in the A1\/P1. We don't want to have one of them not be an investment-grade. We take a look at the metrics and we feel pretty good about the metrics long-term. And so, the investment-grade is pretty important to us.","Brian J. Lalli - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the response. I appreciate it.","Robert J.

Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Hi, Rich.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Hi. On the Protective & Marine business I thought in your opening comments you talked about that under the Paint Stores Group. Was I correct?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Okay. Is there also \u2013 there is also a Protective & Marine in the Global Finishes segment?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Yes. That's correct, Richard. The Protective & Marine cuts across three segments. There's also some Protective & Marine business in Latin America.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Okay, fine. So is your comment that you made for under the Paint Stores Group a preferable to all three other segments, where the other segments, Protective & Marine being down?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","Yeah. In terms of the impact of the current oil and gas pricing and the depression in mining activity, yes.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Okay, fine. Okay, thanks. Now, in the Paint Stores Group for Protective & Marine it's being sold by the local stores versus one of your major distributor centers is that the difference there?","John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's correct. We use the 4,000 plus stores as a point of distribution.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Okay, great. Second question is, I don't want to sound stupid about this, but in the Consumer Group, when you talk about making investments I'm not sure exactly what that means? If it means, your people in the stores, training the stores people, shelf space, can you elaborate a little bit on that?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","I think, number one, that's a partial list, but all three \u2013 all the things that you just mentioned plus different point of purchase materials, displays, maybe even thinning equipment, color matching equipment \u2013 all of that will go into that.","Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates","Okay.

I'm Matt Skowronski on for Dmitry. Looking at Brazil and Latin America, Brazilian currency is kind of flat year-over-year. So, do you guys expect positive FX comps in the second half or are other currencies kind of going to weigh you down like the peso or the Argentinian peso?","Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact","No. Don't worry about the Argentinian peso. The four currencies that drive us \u2013 and I'm talking specifically Sherwin \u2013 are Brazilian reais, which is better than it was in the first quarter but still a headwind in the second quarter. We were still in the 3.11. We expect that possibly by the fourth quarter that's not going to be a headwind. That's going to be a tailwind.","The second is Canadian dollar. The Canadian dollar has continued to be weak. So, we expect that's going to be a headwind for the remainder of the year. The euro, which is relatively flat, and so we think \u2013 but we have a big presence in the UK. And with the Ronseal brand, the [Lee's] paint brand, the Geocel and the Great Britain pound is now a headwind \u2013 a significant headwind.","Matthew Stephen Skowronski - Longbow Research LLC","Okay.

Wells","Thanks, Claudia. Summarizing overall key performance for the second quarter 2012 versus second quarter 2011, consolidated net sales increased $218.3 million or 9.3% to $2.57 billion due primarily to higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and selling price increase across all segments.","Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased consolidated net sales 2.5%, and acquisitions added 1% to net sales in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $127.8 million for the quarter to $1.15 billion. Gross margin increased 130 basis points year-over-year to 44.7% of sales from 43.4% in the second quarter last year.","Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 7.2% to $810.2 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 31.5% in the second quarter this year from 32.1% last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $10.2 million, a decrease of $1.5 million compared to second quarter last year. Other general expense net increased $3.8 million year-over-year due primarily to higher environmental expense. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $70.8 million or 27.5% to $327.8 million.","Our effective tax rate in the second quarter this year was 30.5% compared to 30.3% in the second quarter of 2011. For the full year 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30% range compared to last year's rate of 40.4%.","Consolidated net income increased $48.7 million or 27.2% to $227.8 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 8.9% compared to 7.6% in the second quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 30.7% to $2.17 per share from $1.66 per share in 2011.","Looking at our results by operating segment. Paint Stores Group sales in the second quarter increased 14.6% to $1.49 billion. Comparable store sales, or sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 13.9%.","Regionally, in the second quarter, our Midwestern division led all divisions followed by Southwestern division, Southeastern division and Eastern division. Sales by all 4 Paint Stores divisions rose double digits in the second quarter compared to last year. Paint Stores Group segment profit for the quarter increased $60.4 million or 29.2% to $267 million, and segment margin in the quarter increased to 17.9% from 15.9% last year.","Turning to our Consumer Group. Sales in the second quarter increased 5.9% to $397.7 million. Acquisitions increased consumer segment sales 1.5% in the quarter. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $19.4 million or 31.6% to $80.8 million in the quarter. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 20.3% from 16.3% in the same period last year.","For our Global Finishes Group, second quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 3.3% to $498.7 million. Acquisitions increased net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately 3.8%, while unfavorable currency translation decreased sales by 5.4%.","Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased 58.8% in the quarter to $48 million. Acquisitions increased segment profit approximately $600,000 in the quarter, and unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit $4.4 million. As a percent to net external sales, Global Finishes Group segment profit was 9.6% in the quarter compared to 6.3% last year.","For our Latin America Coatings Group, second quarter net sales in U.S. dollars decreased 4.5% to $187.3 million. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased net sales by 14.5% in the quarter. Stated in U.S. dollars, segment profit decreased $9.3 million in the quarter from $15.8 million last year. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit $2.6 million. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 5% in the quarter compared to 8.1% in second quarter 2011.","I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our Lead Pigment Litigation. The Santa Clara case, involving claims in public nuisance brought by 10 cities and counties in California against 5 to 10 companies, continues to move forward. At a pretrial hearing held in May, the judge presiding over the case moved the trial date from September of this year to March 11, 2013, to allow the parties more time to complete the discovery process and file dispositive pretrial motions.","That concludes our review of the results for the second quarter 2012, so I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the third quarter and full year. Chris?","Christopher M. Connor","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. With a very solid first half of 2012 now on the books, we feel very good about our prospects for the full year. Although we face some tougher comparisons in the second half and particularly in the fourth quarter, we're confident that we can continue to outpace the market in both revenue and volume growth and maintain the strong operating momentum we've established in the first half.","Whether you look at our results for the quarter or for 6 months, the operating leverage and incremental sales volume is pretty easy to spot. In the quarter, we grew net income 27% and earnings per share 31% on a 9% sales gain. Flow-through on the incremental sales of our 4 reportable segments combined passed 41% in the second quarter and 32% in the first half. We controlled our SG&A spending and managed working capital well and generated strong 6-month net operating cash.","The strength in our second quarter results is primarily from the North American market. We often have refer to the specific end market segments that we serve in our Paint Stores Group. In the second quarter, sales to the new residential painting contractor, the residential repaint contractor, property management, commercial contractors, DIY customers, protected and marine contractors and product finishes all grew double digits led by both the new residential and residential repaint segments which were up double digits and down volume as well.","Our Consumer Group delivered solid growth across all major brands and product categories. And our automotive finishes, product finishes and protected and marine coatings businesses in North America were strong across the board. Even as the domestic economy showed signs of slowing the second quarter, demand for our products held up well and our pricing remains firm.","Over the past few months, we've seen the price of high-grade chloride titanium dioxide stabilize due to weak industry demand, and we believe this trend is likely to continue over the balance of 2012.","This factor, combined with a fairly sharp drop in the price of propylene, a key feedstock for monomers, latex, solvents and containers, should help to curb the rate of raw material inflation going forward.","Based on these developments, we now expect average year-over-year raw material cost inflation for the paints and coatings industry to be in the mid- to high-single-digit range in 2012, down from our previous guidance of high single to low double-digits.","The significant jump in our consolidated gross margin in the quarter was the result of 2 factors. First, the increase in production volume; and second, an adjustment in our second quarter LIFO accrual, consistent with our long-standing LIFO accounting practices to reflect our revised outlook for raw material inflation. Because these factors can cause distortions in our gross margin from quarter-to-quarter, comparing our year-to-date gross margin of 43.8% to last year's 43.2%, an improvement of 60 basis points, is a better representation of the progress that we have made in offsetting persistent raw material inflation.","In the first 6 months of 2012, we generated $202 million in net operating cash, an increase of $94 million over the first half of 2011. Cash from operations actually increased $153 million to $261 million before payment of $59 million to the IRS in the first quarter to complete our 2011 tax settlement.","Our working capital, which we describe as receivables plus inventories minus payables, decreased as a percent of sales to 12.6% from 14.9% in the second quarter last year. The change in working capital increased net operating cash by approximately $71 million. We continue to use the company's cash to purchase shares of our stock for treasury, increase our cash dividend and expand our controlled distribution platform.","During the quarter, we acquired 1.5 million shares of the company stock for treasury, bringing our total year-to-date purchase activity to 3.3 million shares at an average cost of $109.89 per share, for a total investment of $363 million. On June 30, we had remaining authorization to acquire 17.75 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, up from $0.365 per share last year.","Our store growth over the past 4 years, combined with innovative new products, marketing programs and sales initiatives, have resulted in steady market share gains in most contractor segments and double-digit growth in DIY sales 6 of the past 8 quarters. So far this year, our Paint Stores Group has added 20 net new stores, 15 of which were opened in the second quarter. This brings our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean to 3,470 locations compared to 3,408 a year ago. As we commented in April, we are ramping up our new store opening activity, and our Paint Store Group plans to add approximately 60 to 65 net new store locations during the year.","Looking ahead, the outlook for global economic growth has become increasingly gloomy, and risks to the U.S. economy have increased accordingly. Thus far, paints and coatings demand in our domestic businesses has remained resilient. We are optimistic that domestic architectural paint market volumes, primarily in the residential segments, will remain positive over the balance of the painting season and demand for most industrial coatings will continue to expand. The greatest challenges in the second half are likely to be the worsening market conditions in Latin America and Europe and the increasingly difficult comparisons from the second half of 2011.","Our outlook for the third quarter 2012 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the mid-single digits compared to last year's third quarter. With sales at this level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the quarter to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.20 per share compared to $1.71 per share in 2011. For the full year 2011, we expect consolidated net sales to increase in the high single digits to low teens over last year. With annual sales at that level, we've raised our expectation for diluted net income per common share for 2012 to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.40 per share compared to $4.14 per share earned in 2011.","Again, let me thank all of you for joining us this morning. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Looking at the Paint Store segment, when we look at the growth, the 14.5% looks pretty solid. It's down from the levels that you saw in the first quarter. And I guess I'm wondering what the drivers are. Is it all weather that we've kind of talked about last quarter a lot? Or is it, are there other things going whether it's pricing decelerating or actual core growth decelerating? How should we think about that?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I think you should think about it, John, as a heck of a strong quarter for the Paint Stores Group, 14% consolidated sales. When we look at some of the competitive numbers that are coming out, it's terrific. We commented that the first quarter is the smallest quarter for the year. We did have unusually good weather. We said we didn't think we'd pull much demand forward and gave guidance that we'd see the strong double-digit sales gain in the second quarter. And that's exactly what happened.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then just one follow-up. On the margin side, when we look -- the consumer segment year-over-year had actually a better improvement than the Paint Store side, which I guess to us is a little bit counterintuitive given who your customers are. So can you walk us through the dynamics of what may be driving that improvement versus maybe a slightly smaller improvement on the Paint Store side?","Sean P. Hennessy","That was as Chris said, great quarter. John, this is Sean Hennessy. And when you take a look at the gallons that were going through the manufacturing, the logistics, the warehouse systems over there, it was a nice quarter for the Consumer Group on their own. But they also had some really nice improvement with the efficiencies of those gallons. I will go back and just remind you, when we take a look at our company, the gallons that we can put through that stores chain and go through that consumer chain. That's really when you look at that incremental margin that Chris mentioned in his comments, that's really where we get it. And so this is not uncommon. If you look at the margins 3, 4 years ago, the peak margins of consumers have always been higher than stores. But what we've said is, consumers will be more stable.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In your same-store sales growth of 13.9%, how much of that was price, would you gauge?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. We basically have given some directional color here. We said that volumes were more significant than price. Price was mid-single-digits.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then if you -- you mentioned that the economy is showing some weakness. Did you see any sort of like if you look at the quarter month-to-month-to-month, did you see any sort of sequential slowdown? And then if not, if it remained pretty steady, is there any reason to think that it wouldn't remain steady going into the third quarter, which is probably typically your strongest quarter?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I would say throughout the quarter, Ivan, the performance is pretty steady month-to-month-to-month. I think we're listening to some of the comments relative to more of the industrial sector of the U.S. economy slowing down a little bit. But as we've commented in the third quarter, we expect the domestic residential architectural volume to remain strong.","Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then my last question, in raw materials for the quarter, where would you gauge them up on a year-over-year basis?","Robert J. Wells","With the range of mid- to high single digits, Ivan, it's likely for the industry that raw -- the raw material basket was up -- towards the upper end of that range for 2Q just because of the annualization of inflation last year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Just real quickly, Bob, on continuing that last question, what would the exit rate be for the year based on the guidance for the full year on the raw material inflation?","Robert J. Wells","Probably below the low end of that range in the fourth quarter.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Still positive though?","Robert J. Wells","Yes, and obviously, Dennis, it depends on where they go from here. But based on the trends that we're seeing now that we based our outlook of mid- to high single-digits on, it's going to be mid-single digits at worst in the fourth quarter probably a bit below that.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","And then, Chris, your comment on incremental margins for the first half of the year being around, I think, 30% for the 3 segments combined -- or 4 segments combined. For the full half, is there still a drag of price versus raw materials embedded in that?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I mean, the margin performance is behind last year's performance at that point. So there's absolutely a drag on raw still [ph].","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. And then there would also be a drag embedded in that from currency?","Christopher M. Connor","Definitely, yes. On both sides.","Robert J. Wells","Right.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question, having to do with price. I think I hit around this quickly, but price decelerated in Paint Stores 1Q to 2Q. Can you just clarify that if that's true, and I have just a follow-up on that.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, I think when you take a look at it, let me just answer that from the first Q to the second Q. So this is -- when you take a look at the effect of -- let me just talk about the effectiveness of price increases over the year. We've always said and we were always realizing about 75%. And going into this raw material escalation, we continued -- as we continue to see more and more price increases and so forth, what you -- what we start to see is that effectiveness started going down from 75%. I don't think -- I think it's pretty natural when you hear Chris' comments that comp store is up 13.9% over half of that -- I mean, it was over -- it was volume. That tells you that price and the amount of price we put in, you multiply it out that you would say that anniversarying some of these things we didn't get 75%. We also think we probably have gotten the majority. So when you take a look at it, we did anniversary a price increase in June of last year, which when you sit there and take a look at June, we did see a -- in fact, it did have some effectiveness and we started seeing the price difference, so a little bit lower in June versus the other 2 months just as we annualized that price increase. But that's how I would say it's because of that June anniversary. And I think in total, when you look at the kind of pricing we did get in the second quarter, it will also tell you we didn't get 100% of the 75%.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then on top of that, with the new residential market and construction coming back and likely outgrowing overall volumes and thinking about that over the next couple of years, is there a negative mix on price there because that tends to be more boiler-type product?","Christopher M. Connor","I don't think so. I mean we've commented that sometimes pricing for those larger customers will be a little bit softer. But again, the operating margins are very consistent across all of these customer segments. So that's not a concern for us at all, Dennis.","Sean P. Hennessy","I think there's been a market change a little bit from the 80s when it was more of a \"blow and go\" I think that you're seeing.","Christopher M. Connor","Higher quality products will be included in that segment.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","So the price per gallon in new construction is not that different than what you might see in other segments?","Christopher M. Connor","Probably less, but not that dramatic.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, so the contractor strength that you saw in the early spring, has that continued here late in the season? And do you expect the contractor market to outperform DIY in the second half?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I mean we took you through kind of the litany, P.J., of the specific contractor segments inside that broad category that we monitor and the comment that all -- every one of those segments was up double digits in the quarter. And again, as we commented throughout the year, this will be the strength for the company this year. We continue to have lots of projects on the books, and we're expecting to have a good performance from that group in the third and fourth quarter.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And in Global Finishes, your margins have jumped up nicely despite some negative FX impact. Are these margins sustainable given, Chris, your gloomy outlook that you described?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. We think -- this is Sean, by the way, P.J., but we think the margins, it's showing a couple of things. I think in Chris' comments, he talked about domestic sales inside that Global Finishes Group were strong. And we get more flow-through on domestic sales, I mean, to outside the country. So I think that shouldn't change. I think it's consistent with what Chris said. And also, I think the operating margins are starting to be improved as we're starting to see some integration activity start to show some positive results.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And finally, with raw material sort of taming down, what kind of pricing do you expect in the second half?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, I think we've indicated we publicly share with you when we raise prices, February's the last time we've taken prices. We don't comment prospectively on forward price increases. We made the comment that our price has held firm in the second quarter. Time will tell.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So your consolidated sales grew a little bit more than 9% in the quarter and you expect mid-single digits in the third quarter. Is the difference between the 2 growth rates, the Latin American Coatings Group and the Global Finishes Group essentially, that is slower growth there?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. And we expect that what we have seen throughout the year and if you look at how the euro and really the Brazilian reais and you look at the Mexican peso versus last year and what we originally thought to convert that foreign currency is going to be, the headwind is going, yes. And so when you sit there and take a look at it, that's part of the biggest piece of the issue. The other thing, this is in Bob's comments, when you take a look at the -- the third and fourth quarter are a little stronger for us. And this is when we start seeing the strength last year. So we're going up against a little tougher comp, but foreign exchange headwind is definitely the bigger difference between the second and third quarter.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And for the 6 months, you reported that administrative costs are up about $42 million or $43 million. For the year, are they going to be flat or up $42 million or $43 million? Or do you have some rough estimate?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I think when you take look at -- that growth really came from incentive comps, continuing to do some work on environmental issues and as well as we've done a lot of work on what I'll call IT projects. And I think those things will continue to go through. But I think when you take a look at that $40 million increase year-over-year, I would guess that we would not run at that rate in the second half and it would probably be half of that in the second half.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. Okay, and then lastly, Chris was talking about the stability in the TiO2 market. And I always get muddled over that. That is, are TiO2 prices stabilizing in July versus where they were in April? Or did they stabilize in April where they were in December? What's the stability?","Robert J. Wells","Well, what we mean by stability, this is Bob, what we mean by stability is that pricing is no longer -- does not appear to be rising. We do not believe that the price increase announced by the industry effective in July was very successful. So it appears that TiO2 pricing has stabilized. We do not believe that they're tracking down.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then lastly, the LIFO accrual change in the quarter, how much did that benefit gross margin or operating profits, or whatever measure, just the effective change in the accrual?","Sean P. Hennessy","Right. The change in accrual is probably around 4\/10.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","4\/10?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. 40 basis points of our margin. The core margin was approximately 44.3, and then you had some LIFO adjustments from the first quarter that reversed in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with North Coast Research.","Jamie Dunford","This is Jamie Dunford on for Chuck. What are some of the changes you guys have seen that has given the confidence to increase the guidance for this year?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, I think as we've said all along, Jamie, that as we get into the year and have a little better visibility towards the end when we're able to give you a better look. And as we've commented, it's been a strong gallon performance for the company. And you should read into the guidance for the remainder of the year, we're confident that we're going to continue to see that kind of gallon growth, again driven by North American and residential architectural paint gallons.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Duffy Fischer with Barclays Capital.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you talk about the gap between pricing in stores and the big box? And how has that changed over the last one year?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, Duffy, we pay attention to that. I think you've seen price, some price increases across the board, both at big box channel, as well as the hardware channel, specialty store, et cetera. We've long commented about the irrational industry that we operate in, as titanium dioxide, raw material cost pressures impact all manufacturers and suppliers and then as a result pricing eventually winds its way to the marketplace. We're comfortable with the gap. There's a reason that certain consumers choose to shop in a specialty store environment. And to remind you, many contractors buy at a significant discount off of that shelf price so the gap diminishes quite substantially, if any gap at all exists, when you get to that customer segment.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Fair enough. And then just to clarify, with your assumptions for pricing, your assumptions for cost, what should we think about for that incremental volume going forward from volumes so that, that incremental dollar sales is from a volume basis? What's the incremental margin that you guys will realize?","Sean P. Hennessy","A lot of times we get -- we really point to, if you look back at the incremental margins that we're realizing in 2002 to 2007 time frame, we felt that the incremental gallons this time would be stronger than they were in that time frame. So the numbers that Chris said, we're feeling pretty good about. I think that our -- as long as we continue to get those kinds of gallons, I think you're going to see flow-through.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Chris, on the inter-quarter trends that you articulated, were those trends pretty consistent month-to-month for the Global Finishes and Latin American businesses also?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, it was a steady quarter across the board. All 3 months, we were looking pretty much the same difference. We had some day-count changes from -- month-to-month which impacts the retailer like that but for the most part, very steady.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So you caution that is more a function of what you read about in the news, et cetera, over what you're necessarily seeing, right?","Christopher M. Connor","Correct.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then within Global Finishes, given the strength in the margins, I'm sorry if I missed this but can kind of parse that to volume by the various constituents in there: auto, refinish, protective, et cetera?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. Ghansham, we don't really break out volumes like that. We give you that information on our storage business directionally but not for the other segments. I think suffice it to say that the kind of pricing activity that the company has taken have been fairly consistent across these boards. So we're definitely providing volume gains in each of those areas.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally on working capital. Obviously, a terrific job there and inventories are below year-over-year and then with the surge in sales you've had. Is this sort of the new run rate in terms of working capital? Or do you think there's more to go here?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, I think when we take a look at our working capital, last year, we finished right around just below 11% as a percent of sales. We think we're in pretty good shape. One of the things I just want to remind you is last year we did take a little more inventory into the third quarter from the second quarter because possible shortages and a lot of raw material discussions. If you remember the -- last year, consumer group actually we started to see that inventory drop in the third quarter last year, and we actually have some positive inventory drop. That's when you start to see some flow through. So consumer had good flow through in the third quarter and we said this year was going be more of a normalized nature. And so when you take a look at it, I think that our working capital's in pretty good shape, and I think 11% or just short of 11% for the full year, I think it's a pretty good number.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","The drought that we've had across much of the U.S., not good for the crops but probably pretty good for exterior painting. Did you see much higher growth in exterior versus interior?","Christopher M. Connor","No. I mean, this is the time of year that we should be seeing our exterior gallons perform. They are. They're in line. There's nothing unusual there. Dry weather is good for painting, but 100-degree days, not so much. So we lose the mid-part of the day, painters are starting a lot earlier. Guys are waiting at the front door when we get them open at 6 a.m. in the morning.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then secondly, have you seen the lower propylene prices actually flow through in resin and polypropylene containers and so forth? Or is that still just your anticipation of that?","Christopher M. Connor","I think the propylene-based commodities, John, in the second quarter were probably down slightly. I think there may be more benefit to go.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Chris, I just want to get your actual view on the overall markets. So what's your assumption for how much U.S. architectural volumes will grow overall this year? And again, what percentage would be contractor versus the big box? And then within contractors, it seems that you're growing share. I know some of your competitors like Penmoore [ph] and Access [ph] have well-publicized problems. Just wondering how that's benefiting you.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I think, Don, we've talked about the industry data points. And a lot of smart people like you and your colleagues on the phone have talked about the architectural gallon market in United States growing perhaps at a 3%, 4% rate, which would be more than double its normalized run rate. So that kind of gives you a sense. That feels about right. We've shared with you directionally the kind of gallon performance that we're having on top of that. So we think we're gaining share. We have commented that the contractor is rebounding and reverting back to about 60%. Our expectation of the total purchases of architectural coatings in America -- we're probably a year or 2 away from them getting back to that level. So they're going a little bit faster and the market's going a little faster and we're just in the sweet spot and catching it.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And on the gross margin, the comps get a lot easier in the second half and, of course, now raws aren't going up as much. So are you looking now for much bigger improvement in second half gross margins than you were say back at June -- your May 23 meeting?","Sean P. Hennessy","Well, we always look at that 41.80% in the third quarter and thought that we were going be able to beat that. That was for sure. We expect that the second half margins when you look at versus last second half margins, we feel a little more bullish than we did back on the 23rd, you're right.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And have you changed any of your production plans accordingly given that the raw is coming down in some cases in the second half, did that mean you came into the third quarter with less inventory than you might have otherwise?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I think when you take a look at that -- the question that was asked there earlier, and you see the raw materials had the production down, I think we definitely have less inventory than we did a year ago. Last year, we're were in a position we thought that the raws will continue to rise. And this year, we thought it was little more prudent not to have as much inventory.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Just want to understand a couple of dynamics that you're seeing here. The expansion in margins on the global side of business, you talked about some integration cost sitting there, assuming it's from European acquisitions that you got a couple of years ago. Sort of what's going on in that market? And am I right in assuming that was the major driver behind the margin improvements that you're seeing in global? Or is there some other benefit that's going on there?","Robert J. Wells","I think the number one was the domestic sales in the Global Finishes Group. We do still have quite a bit of sales inside the United States and Canada. And when you look at the domestic sales, that's by far was the #1 reason for the margin improvement. But on top of that, there was some improvement on the European operations. And you're right, it's the acquisitions we did a few years ago.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Would it be fair to say then that the margin impact was driven more by mix as -- after growing higher margin North American business versus perhaps flattish margin or flattish volumes in Europe which is a lower margin business?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","That's fine. Secondly, your administrative costs continue to be up year-over-year and that's sequential. So I'm assuming that's the sort of the new run rate that we should looking at in terms of operating profitability?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. And as I said, I don't think it will be up $40 million like we were in the first half of the year. But I think when you take a look at that, last year, our admin was around $243 million give-and-take. I think if you -- the run rate will be in that $290 million to $310 million.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then finally, just curious about your comments on TiO2 [indiscernible] outlook. I guess you talked about pricing being flattish on weak demand. Paint is the #1 source of TiO2 demand. And paint market, at least in North America, seems to be doing well. So is it the weakness in international markets that's leading to declining demand for TiO2?","Sean P. Hennessy","That's correct, and primarily Asia Pacific.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","A couple of things. The gross margin I understand looking at the first half in total the full out [ph]  of the LIFO benefit. Should the second half gross margin expansion be materially greater than the first half?","Sean P. Hennessy","We'll wait and see. I don't want to put some guidance out there that we're going to have to live with, Eric. I mean, we're pretty careful. Usually, we like to give you a pretty good guidance for the second quarter, but we'll wait to see what happens with the raws in the next couple of months, and I think we'll see. But there's a lot of different moving parts right now with the volatility in the raw materials, quite honestly. I don't want to put an add to it [ph] like you did.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","I understand. Secondly, in terms of price, the change from 2Q to 1Q, I guess, I mean, if you could just clarify a little further, it sounded like price in 1Q contributed maybe as much as 9 or 10 points and 2Q closer to 5. Is that right? And should the second half be sustained in this 5, or how should we think about that? And if you could give us any more color on what's going on within that?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I think when you take a look at the way prices moved up last year, I think the numbers you have are, in the ballpark, pretty good. I think that we'll see what happens with price, but we don't see price growing from that second quarter number, that's for sure.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","And is that, just I guess accordingly, is that just cycling off or is there -- are you taking a little more aggressive position on price that's accelerating your share progress?","Sean P. Hennessy","It's cycling off. I think we're going to -- just I like I mentioned, it's cycling off of the June 6 price increase from 2011. We've got a couple of -- I think in October we're going to see another cycling off. So we don't see the price metrics changing in the architectural paint market. But it's just that annualization.","Christopher M. Connor","I think the comment we made in the opening part of the call, Eric, about prices holding firm. That's our expectation. So it's always as, Sean commented, we're just coming up against these robust and consistent price increases we had in the past years.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then the last question in terms of volume, which sounds like it was a very good number this quarter again. Is that the rate at which volume should grow? I'm just trying to understand the sales guides for the second half of the year, and full year. Is the second quarter volume growth that you saw, is that what you expect to be sustained in the back half?","Sean P. Hennessy","I think when you take a look at it and because of the strength of the volumes, we starting to go against harder comps. I think if we see volume slightly below where we were in the second quarter but not materially lower.","Christopher M. Connor","I mean, negative volumes first half, positive volumes second half last year. The kind of run rate to run right now feels consistent to us, we just have that tougher comparison.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","And I just -- last one if I might. The second quarter sales guidance I think was 10 to 15 and you reported roughly 10 or 9.5. Was the difference there currency or international growth, can you just sort of talk about the severity or the differences between those 2?","Sean P. Hennessy","FX is 100%. The Brazilian reais in town, it was just 2.10. That and the Mexican peso, and the euro, all 3 of those I would say -- it's 99% of where the difference between our guidance and the 9.3 that we came in at.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Matt McGinley with ISI Group.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I have a follow-up on the LIFO comments that you made. I know in the 10-K you disclosed that LIFO has an impact of about $0.59 during all 2011. I think you said it was 40 basis points of help there that you got from that in the second quarter. So I think you're still a lot less in terms of how you recover that. Is there a particular quarter within the year we had a bigger impact? Or was that relatively spread out over the entire year?","Sean P. Hennessy","In 2011?","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Correct.","Robert J. Wells","Yes, I think the one -- it was really the third quarter. And last year you saw the third quarter was around 41.8% last year. It was a little heavier than the other 3. And that's because the raw materials continue to rise and the basket continued to rise, and we were trying to catch up. And this year, it looks we're seeing that the basket forecast that we're giving it continues to go down.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So all this equal, you'd expect the third could be the quarter of greatest recovery within the year?","Sean P. Hennessy","Oh, yes. I mean, I think that the year-over-year comparison of gross margin, we're going to see the greatest impact of that in the third quarter.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. And then on your third quarter sales guidance, you said that the waning impacts of pricing will not be the benefit that it was in clearly the past handful of quarters. You said that FX would likely be worse. Are you within -- in terms with your guidance, are you saying that the units will be positive? Or would you expect that to be down in the third quarter?","Christopher M. Connor","I think it is to be positive.","Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","For the company in total and so not just with the Paint Stores Group?","Christopher M. Connor","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, I think you mentioned you guys had drawn down a little bit on your inventories. I think maybe you're referring to raw material inventory. So I'm just curious, what your expectation as you go through the second half. Is there still some room to do that? Or certainly on the TiO2 side, we've seen your supplier base has had some challenges here in the last few months. So have you reached a sort of detente there? Or what's your expectation going into the second half?","Sean P. Hennessy","I think our raw material inventory will be slightly lower, 5% lower at the end of the year than we are right now. I think -- but I do think finished goods will also be down just as they always do in the third and fourth quarter because our production goes down.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's interesting, it sounds like there's a bifurcated market. You mentioned that in the U.S., architectural paint demand has been very good and you commented that it should continue to do so. Yet the TiO2 weakness seems to be more Asian-based. Do you expect that you'll see some changing behavior from your suppliers now that TiO2 market's loosened up? Or is it still going to be the same old fight that you usually confront?","Christopher M. Connor","You're articulating diverging market trends and  softness globally but the strength in the U.S. Don't forget that titanium prices have been running on us the past couple of years, it's been also a diverging trend because they were referencing tighter demand and we were seeing collapse in the U.S. architectural market. So it's not for us to articulate what their behavior will be like going forward. We can only report on past trends of buying these raw materials. When global supply slackens, it's a period of time when they like to go to get pricing. And it's what Bob commented on that it's the July price increase that was announced did not go in, and we'll see how the second half unfolds.","Robert J. Wells","And just as a reminder Bob, the North American market consumes less than 25% of global supply of TiO2. So we've got 75%, more than 75% of the global TiO2 market that's struggling for volume even if North America is relatively strong.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. And then lastly, if I might, can you give me a sense, if I read in some trade rag that propylene price, contract price changed today, how long would it be before it actually shows up in any meaningful way on a cost of good volumes for Sherwin-Williams?","Robert J. Wells","About -- typically about 50 to 90 days.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.","Christopher Perrella","This is Chris Perrella on for Kevin. Could you elaborate on the softening that you're seeing down in Latin America whether regionally -- a particular region or end markets down there.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. I think to put that in perspective, we're still seeing volume gains in our Latin American operations. First and foremost, the segment reporting is impacted by the FX that Sean is taking you through now. So that's a lot of the headwind. There's a general softening in the Brazilian economy that you read about and we feel that. Same is true slightly in Mexico. But beyond that, I mean these businesses are performing well, holding their own, gaining share in some cases and generating volume gains.","Christopher Perrella","And pricing gains as well in the region?","Christopher M. Connor","Yes. Again, back to the global rational nature of this industry and the important need to get pricing after raws. And so we have seen pricing throughout the region over the last couple of years, including the beginning half of this year, consistent with the kind of comments we've been making about North America.","Christopher Perrella","Okay. And the Geocel acquisition, does that account for the growth in the -- or the sales contribution on the consumer segment?","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes, it will be reported in the consumer segment. There was one month of -- yes, so it was not the majority of the sales growth by any stretch of imagination.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Aram Rubinson with Nomura Securities.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Question about innovation and what it means for price. It sounded at least from the analyst day that innovation is at its highest level in many years. And I would think that usually helps to sustain price. Just wondering why given that circumstance, why we'd be getting less than a 75% kind of realization. And I'm also wondering how that change manifests itself, if its pushback from contractors on price, if it's promotions for retail or something else? And is there something we can be doing to kind of get back to that realization?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, innovation, I think, is an important part of it, but it speaks to the products that are introduced, not the core product line. So as we commented on our investor day, this has been a particularly robust year for us with new products, I think somewhere around 30 new products that hit the market. And to your point, our intent is to bring those products at more of the higher end of the performance spectrum. So they are setting higher selling prices, better margins. But the vast majority of products that we sell as company year-in and year-out despite a strong year like this, come from the core products. The real workhorse products that painters use day in and day out. And that's where I think Sean made the comment about going out for pricing and not really having the full 75% implemented just yet.","Sean P. Hennessy","And I think if you take a look at the history back in the 80s when we used to go out once a year, that 75%, the first time we tried to get a second price increase in the first -- 2 in 1 year, we didn't get all 75%. All of a sudden, we got pretty good unfortunately for 2 in a year, then we went [indiscernible] to 3. And I think we had somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 price increases in about 35 months. So it was so rapid I think that it was hard. We were halfway through it I think that's really what happened to us. Not that I think the market has changed.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Two quick things. Can you talk how much FX was in Q3 guidance? And also, last time, you gave us a gross profit dollar change by segment. Would you mind doing that for us again, please?","Sean P. Hennessy","When I did that last time, we got the Q completely written. We're not in that same spot. We're going to release the Q on the 25th of July. So I think we're not going be exact now with you between now and then. But then I think you get the dollar exchanges right then and there from the Q. But no, I think that the FX, if you take a look at how much headwind we had in the second quarter, I think you can -- the guidance has more FX headwind than the second quarter. I'm not -- I really don't want to give you an exact number.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","On the Latin American group, it looks like FX hurt your top line close to $30 million and yet on the operating profit level, it was only about $2.6 million hit. So could you explain what you do to mitigate that falling all the way to the bottom line? Was it improved leverage or a fixed cost leverage from higher volumes? Or just add a little bit more color to what you did to mitigate that headwind.","Sean P. Hennessy","Yes. I think one of the things you have to realize is when you do get FX headwinds, it's not dollar for dollar going to the bottom line because it also affects your SG&A and it affects other things. So when you take a look at it, I think Chris has hinted that we did have volume gains down there, and the world market on the raw materials that grows -- pricing was going on in there. So I think volume offset it. I think pricing offset it. And those are really the 2 things.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. On your guidance for the full year, it suggests some deceleration in the back half in terms of earnings growth. Is there anything behind that? Is it conservatism? Is it seasonality? Or is it just growth happened to be so strong?","Sean P. Hennessy","No. I think the first half, I mean, when you sit there and say that this first half -- and if you get a chance to read the Q, there's a lot of things in there over the last 12 months. So really when you look at the last 4 quarters combined, our net operating cash flow was over 10%, the flow-through was very strong when you put these 4 quarters together. So it's going up against a little tougher comparisons. And when we look at the second half, we're pretty excited about how things are going to come out. We think that we're going to have some nice flow-through.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Great. And then just finally, it seems in the Paint Stores Group, the remodel part of the portfolio is probably driving a little bit more of the volume than the new residential. I don't know if that's completely accurate, so if you could help me with that. But is this -- as we see home sales improve, existing home sales, whatever's going on there, are we going to -- do you think there'll be a mix shift? Or are we going to see that residential growth -- shouldn't the remodel growth stay where it is? And then on top that, have a nice icing on the cake from new residential.","Christopher M. Connor","Yes, I think that's a good way to think about it, Nils. As a reminder, the demand for architectural paint in North America is predominantly for remodel, redecorating and maintenance, so you can think in terms of 80% plus or minus a few points on that. So as the new construction comes back, it will have a positive impact but a smaller amount. I think most folks are talking about housing starts somewhere in the 700,000 range. We believe that the sustainable number in our country's north of 1 million units, so we have several years of reasonable marginal growth and improvement in that to get back to a normalized run rate. On our way there, our expectations will be that the ongoing maintenance, decorating for the existing infrastructure housing stock will be really driving this number. And to your point about as housing sales are picking back up, as housing volumes are improving, those are all really positive market metrics for sustained growth in this business.","Operator","Our last question is a follow-up from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, I just have a quick clarification. You talked about the paint group seeing about mid-single digit of pricing on year-over-year basis. I'm assuming it's somewhat similar in the consumer group, which would imply that volume growth there was pretty close to 0 year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about sort of what's driving that if my math is correct?","Christopher M. Connor","Well, as we've stated over and over, we don't give that kind of same clarity and break out that we do in our stores business for the other segments. And I will tell you that our consumer group did have volume growth as well.","Operator","Gentlemen, there are no further questions. I'll now turn the floor back over to Bob Wells for closing remarks.","Robert J. Wells","I'd like to thank you all once again for your participation in today's call. I will be available as usual over the balance of the day and week to address any follow-up questions. We appreciate you joining us today, and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.","Operator","This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation."]}}
